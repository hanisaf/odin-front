[{"city":"Melbourne","country":"Australia","text":"\ufeffPEOPLE ARE\nAT THE HEART OF ALL CITIES\nA resilient Melbourne will draw on the strengths of our diverse communities and geographies, to pursue our shared interests, embrace our differences and be stronger together. We will help communities prepare for change and whatever the future may hold. We will work today, tomorrow and together, towards a\nviable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous Melbourne.\nWELCOME AND OVERVIEW\nResilient Melbourne marks an important point in Melbourne's development.\nIt presents the first of our city's resilience strategies: a starting point that brings together individuals and organisations critical to the resilience of Melbourne and its diverse communities. It offers a new way to deal with the chronic stresses and acute shocks we are likely to experience, and to achieve our vision of a city that is viable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous, today and long into the future.\nThis strategy alone will not secure that vision. But by\npublishing this strategy, we are taking this work to\nour communities, seeking the active involvement of\npeople and organisations who want to help protect and improve the lives of Melburnians: from individuals and small community groups to our largest institutions\nand corporations.\nWe invite you to tell us how you are helping to\nstrengthen Melbourne as it prepares for the future. Let us know about new ways of working, or projects that could transform parts of the city for the better. We continue to seek additional partners for many of the actions set out here, and we will need to develop many more. We look forward to working with you.\nThis strategy is the result of the work of more\nthan 1,000 individuals from 230 organisations, Melbourne's 32 local councils, and many Victorian Government departments. We thank everyone involved for their commitment to this great collaboration.\nThe Introduction (p. 7) explains the origins of Resilient\nMelbourne and why urban resilience is important,\nboth globally and locally. Melbourne in context (p. 16)\ndescribes the progression of our city, from the land\nof traditional owners to the multicultural and modern\nmetropolis it is today, including the chronic stresses and acute shocks that we face.\nThis sets the scene for why we are pursuing our four\nresilience objectives, each of which reflects an area\nwhere local government can take a leading role in\nbuilding a more resilient Melbourne, in partnership with other sectors. These objectives are shown in the diagram on page 5 and are described in more detail on pages\n37-53. The diagram also sets out how we will achieve\nthese objectives, through four action areas that\nencourage collaboration between disciplines and sectors, to implement three flagship actions, 15 supporting actions and 15 aligned local actions (see below for definitions). This is all described in more detail in the sections Adapt (p. 60-87), Survive (p. 88-109), Thrive (p. 110-137) and Embed (p. 138-154). Throughout the document we also highlight how the 100RC network is contributing to Melbourne's efforts in \u2018learning from others' and \u2018100RC global network in action'.\n\u00b0-tr EXAMPLES OF MELBOURNE'S __X CHRONIC STRESSES\n\u2022 Rapid population growth\n\u2022 Increasing social inequality\n\u2022 Increasing pressures on our natural assets\n\u2022 Unemployment, particularly among young people\n\u2022 Climate change\n\u2022 Increasing rates of alcoholism and family violence\nEXAMPLES OF MELBOURNE'S ACUTE SHOCKS\n\u2022 Bushfires \u2022 Floods \u2022 Heatwaves \u2022 Disease pandemics \u2022 Infrastructure-related emergencies \u2022 Extremist acts, including cyber-crime\nTypes of actions in Resilient Melbourne\nFlagship:\nKey initiatives with the potential\nfor metropolitan-wide involvement and transformational outcomes.\nSupporting:\nInitiatives with the potential to\nimprove Melbourne's resilience\non a range of scales - some may affect only a few council areas, while others could apply across the metropolitan area.\nAligned:\nExisting initiatives that align with Resilient Melbourne principles and have the potential for further local government input.\nIn developing this strategy, we have followed three guiding principles, agreed at the outset of our work: build on Melbourne's existing structures and institutions; avoid duplication of effort and investment, and; deliver tangible benefits to our communities. Although\nachieving our long-term objectives will require work\nover generations - thirty years or more - the actions in this strategy will bring real results starting today. These projects are affordable, scalable, replicable and measurable. They will support our communities' efforts to adapt to the accelerating changes we face, to survive no matter what shocks occur, and to confidently thrive, building a Melbourne that offers a higher quality of life to all of its citizens, now and for future generations.\nWe encourage you to read on and find out more about what all this means in practice, and share the strategy with your networks. We hope you enjoy this strategy, and we welcome your responses.\nYou can contact the Resilient Melbourne team at resilence@melbourne.vic.gov.au.\nThe mayors and CEOs of Melbourne's\nmetropolitan councils came together to discuss finalising the strategy. They were joined by the Resilient Melbourne Steering Committee at Melbourne Town Hall on 14 April, 2016.\nVISION\nIn a resilient Melbourne, our diverse communities are viable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous.\nSTRONGER TOGETHER\nEmpower communities to take active responsibility for their own and each other's wellbeing, safety and health.\nOUR SHARED PLACES\nCreate and sustain buildings,\ninfrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity and health.\nA DYNAMIC ECONOMY\nProvide diverse local employment opportunities that support an adaptable workforce that is ready for the jobs of the future.\nA HEALTHIER ENVIRONMENT\nEnable strong natural assets and ecosystems alongside a growing population.\nj\tAction Areas\tj\nToday, tomorrow and together, we will take action to:\nA\tB\nU\tE\n\t\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\t\t\u2022 \u2022\nJ\tJ\tJ\t\nFLAGSHIP ACTION\tFLAGSHIP ACTION\tFLAGSHIP ACTION\tKEY SUPPORTING ACTION\nMetropolitan\tEmergency management\tThe metropolitan\tThe Resilient Melbourne\nurban forest\tcommunity resilience\tcycling corridor\tDelivery Office\nstrategy\tframework for Victoria\tnetwork\t(p. 142)\n(p. 62)\t(p. 90)\t(p. 112)\t\nIn addition to the three flagship actions, there are:\nSUPPORTING ACTIONS ALIGNED LOCAL ACTIONS\nSee page 59 for a summary of all actions\nINTRODUCTION\nResilient Melbourne is the culmination of work by people from across sectors, council boundaries and community groups, coming together to consider a shared challenge: what can we do to protect and improve the lives of Melburnians, now and in the future?\nDeveloped with the support of 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) - the strategy sets out a series of distinct, yet connected, actions that will help make Melbourne a viable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous city, long into the future.\nUrban resilience and 100 Resilient Cities\nThe world's population is projected to reach 9.5 billion in 2050, with 75 per cent\nof these people living in cities.1 The Rockefeller Foundation pioneered the 100RC\ninitiative in response to the trends of urbanisation, globalisation and climate change\nAs cities grow larger, the likely consequences of\nunexpected events are ever greater for individual\ncities. Cities are also more numerous and increasingly interdependent, meaning the effects of events in one place can be felt around the world. Meanwhile, climate change increases the likelihood of greater numbers\nof catastrophic events happening.2\nAlready, Australia is one of the world's most urbanised\ncountries - almost 90 per cent of Australians live in urban areas, mainly on our eastern seaboard and we are vulnerable to a wide range of stresses and shocks.3\nDefinition of resilience\n100RC defines urban resilience as the capacity of individuals, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to adapt, survive and thrive no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nCHRONIC STRESSES\nChallenges that weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis. Examples include sea level rise, increasing pressures on healthcare services, unemployment, and deeper social inequality.\nACUTE SHOCKS\nSudden events that threaten a city. In Melbourne, examples of acute shocks include heatwaves, bushfires, floods, influenza pandemics, and extremist acts, including cyber-crime.\nWhy the Resilient Melbourne project?\nMelbourne is a vibrant and proudly multicultural city of 4.3 million residents, originating from more than 180 different countries. A \u2018city of cities', Melbourne is made up of 32 local government authorities (councils) spread over 10,000 square kilometres around Port Phillip Bay, comprising hundreds of diverse local neighbourhoods, each with its own character, cultural mix and set of advantages and problems.\nToday, the scale and pace of demographic change in\nMelbourne are unprecedented. Projections suggest\nthat by 2051 Melbourne will be home to approximately 7.7 million people, and is likely to be Australia's largest city.4 Globalisation continues to disrupt our economy and society, while climate change is increasing the\nrisk of extreme events and undermining many of the\nassumptions used to plan and develop our city.\nTo cope with this increasing complexity and uncertainty, we need a new approach. This must be centred on our communities, supporting and enabling them to adapt to these accelerating changes and the associated stresses, to survive no matter what shocks occur, and to confidently thrive. This approach will link new\nresilience-building actions with existing efforts - this way we can build a Melbourne that is a better place for future generations to live in, and whose services and advantages can be enjoyed by all of its citizens.\nOur three levels of government - local, state and Commonwealth - and hundreds of business and community organisations need to be part of this new approach, making resilience part of everything they do. To create the environment for communities to adapt, survive and thrive, we must innovate, be adaptable and flexible, collaborate across traditional boundaries and sectors, and act now, for the long term. Resilient Melbourne will be an important contributor to this process, turning uncertainty into opportunity.\nHow was this strategy developed?\nResilient Melbourne is a true collaboration - led by councils - across levels of government, business and community. It is based on engagement with over 1000 stakeholders across Melbourne, Australia and the broader 100RC network.\nThe strategy has been developed in two phases.\nIt was launched with an agenda setting workshop in April 2014. With this providing some valuable initial context, the work began in earnest towards the end of that year. This involved broad research and consultation to better understand strengths and vulnerabilities likely to affect Melbourne's resilience. It included identifying our city's critical physical and social infrastructure, along with the shocks and stresses that could threaten them in the future, described further below in Melbourne in context. Through a series of discussions and meetings we also sought to understand perceptions of Melbourne's resilience, including initiatives and practices that are already contributing to the resilience of our city.\nBased on this information, in June 2015 we released Melbourne's Preliminary Resilience Assessment, which was the first of its kind in Australia. The document was informed and supported by the mayors and chief executive officers (CEOs) of Melbourne's metropolitan councils and proposed five discovery areas for deeper investigation by working groups.\nThe members of these working groups were subject matter experts, led by local government CEOs. Using desktop research, spatial mapping, surveys, interviews, and innovative design sessions attended by organisations from diverse sectors, the working groups further investigated the discovery areas, the opportunities and challenges associated with each. The research and engagement helped us shape our vision for a resilient Melbourne - a city that is viable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous, long into the future. Having undergone\nthorough examination, our five discovery areas evolved into the four long-term objectives described\non pages 37-53.\nDrawing on local ideas and examples of excellence from around the world (notably from cities in the 100RC network), our working groups identified more than 200 relevant opportunities to tackle resilience challenges and help achieve these objectives. We then tested and refined each opportunity using the principles of the 100RC City Resilience Framework, including the \u2018resilience lens' and qualities of resilience (see opposite). This ensured that the actions in this strategy have resilience thinking at their core, and that they will bring the broadest possible benefits. To achieve these they are organised under four action areas described on page 55.\nMelbourne's Indigenous\ncommunities and colonial past\nA resilient Melbourne recognises the value of the diversity and strength of\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. We want an inclusive community\n- one where Melbourne's social and economic advantages can be fully enjoyed by the First Peoples of this land.\nThe land surrounding where the Birrarung (Yarra River) runs into the Nerm (Port Phillip Bay) is Kulin country.\nAt the time of European settlement, the local Aboriginal population was estimated at somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 people. The place now known as Melbourne is one in which Aboriginal people have lived, cared for country, and maintained their distinctive culture, for at least 30,000 years.7 This longevity alone demonstrates the resilience of our First Peoples.\nAlthough there are many stories and places in and around Melbourne that contain evidence of this connection to country, it is not always apparent to people who visit, live or work here. Nevertheless, Melbourne today is a significant gathering place for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and is regarded by many as the hub of Victorian Aboriginal communities.\nTraditional Aboriginal cultures and communities were severely and irrevocably harmed by the arrival of Europeans. The actions of explorers, whalers, sealers and settlers all took their toll on Aboriginal society. These repercussions are still felt today. Aboriginal Australians have strived to retain their culture and identity through the period of non-Indigenous settlement, for more than two centuries.\nIn 1835, the fledgling community that would become Melbourne was called \u2018Bearbrass'. There were 177 new settlers (142 male, 35 female), 13 buildings and some 26,000 sheep.8 For the European arrivals, Melbourne\nwas at the far edge of the known world. It was a harsh\nenvironment that would have demanded resilience -people needed to be resourceful and adaptable to live here. If crops failed, sickness struck, or fire destroyed property, the new settlers had no outside support to turn to.\nThe grid that surveyor Robert Hoddle laid out for the settlement in 1837 had unusually wide streets and abundant parklands, more suited to a large city than to the small town that existed at the time. Even as a \u2018remote and sleepy wool port', this place possessed something that inspired visions of a grand future.9 The first non-indigenous settlers survived then thrived, adapting to their new environment and laying the cultural, economic and physical foundations of the modern city that is Melbourne today.\nToday, Melbourne is a liveable city\nMelbourne is a stable and cohesive society, with many residents enjoying a high standard of living and quality of life, supported by ready access to education and healthcare. In Melbourne, a challenge for our resilience is maintaining these advantages and making them available to everybody.\nMelbourne is known internationally for its excellence in urban design, creativity, culture and innovation.\nWe have a sporting precinct at our heart, and throughout the city we enjoy cultural institutions such as art galleries, museums, libraries and theatres. Melbourne is recognised as a UNESCO City of Literature and as a UNESCO City of Learning (Melton), and is a major centre for street art, music and theatre.10 All of these strengths support and contribute to our rich and diverse culture.\nThese amenities and our culture create economic opportunities and have contributed to Melbourne being consistently ranked as one of the world's most liveable cities for more than a decade.11 These rankings reflect our high levels of stability and security, access to healthcare, education and culture, advanced infrastructure and relatively clean environment.\nHowever, these rankings do not consider factors such as housing affordability or account for inequality across Melbourne. While our city is liveable for those with easy access to essential services and a well-paying job, living in the world's sixth-most expensive city presents major difficulties for many Melburnians, particularly in areas of entrenched disadvantage and those located furthest from the central business district.12\nInequality in Melbourne has other causes too.\nFor example, gender, race and disability still influence a person's earning potential. The average weekly earnings of women in Victoria are 14 per cent lower than those of their male counterparts.\nIn 2013, average weekly disposable incomes of Melbourne's Indigenous population were $135 less than the incomes of non-Indigenous Melburnians ($564 versus $699).13 Alongside this, people with a disability\nare likely to have lower incomes, due to lower workforce participation, and are often forced to rely more on government allowances such as the Disability Support Pension.14\nSelected findings from research into Melburnians' perceptions around community cohesion48\nVULNERABILITY AND DISADVANTAGE IN MELBOURNE\nVulnerability Analysis of Mortgage, Petroleum and Inflation Risks and Expenditure (VAMPIRE) Index, 2011\nSince the Second World War, Melbourne's growth has radiated outwards from the central business district.\nA 2012 parliamentary inquiry into liveability in outer suburban Melbourne found that this, and the rapid rate of growth, \u2018has placed significant pressure on existing infrastructure and created strong demand for new\ninfrastructure'.15 Outer suburban communities have poorer access to employment, services and transport, and are at\nThe map below shows how more car-dependent areas are more vulnerable to fluctuations in factors such as petrol prices and interest rates.\nSocio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)\nGeographic disadvantage is entrenched in many\ncommunities. Despite a proliferation of social initiatives\nled by Commonwealth and state governments, many areas\nthat were disadvantaged decades ago remain disadvantaged\ntoday.17 Melbourne\u2019s councils, thanks to their strong links with their local communities, are well placed to tackle these inequities.\nThe map below shows the spread of disadvantage across Melbourne. High disadvantage is defined as low access to \u2018material and social resources and ability to participate in society', which include factors such as employment, English-speaking proficiency and household income.\nProudly multicultural and diverse\nMelbourne's diversity is a major strength, but to be truly resilient our society must also be cohesive, to avoid the stresses caused by disunity, and to be able to act as one when shocks do strike.\nAcross the Greater Melbourne area, nearly one-third of residents were born overseas, with the largest numbers coming from the United Kingdom (4.2 per cent),\nIndia (2.7 per cent), China (2.3 per cent), Italy (1.7 per cent) and New Zealand (1.7 per cent).18 There are also substantial Vietnamese, Sri Lankan and Malaysian-born communities, in addition to recent South African and Sudanese migrants. Across Melbourne, 33 per cent of people speak a language other than English at home.19 Melbourne has the largest Greek-speaking population outside Europe - comparable to some larger cities in Greece - and the surname Nguyen is our second-most common surname, after Smith.20\nInclusion and integration are essential qualities of resilience, both for systems and people. Melbourne has a long history of inclusion and many see our acceptance of new arrivals as one of our greatest strengths. However, there have been problems, including racial intolerance, although at comparatively low levels compared to some other parts of the world.\nImmigration from overseas is set to be the greatest contributor to Melbourne's and Victoria's population growth, with an average of 48,000 people estimated to arrive every year between 2006 and 2036.21 This movement of people brings new skills and greater cultural understanding, as well as connecting us more deeply to the rest of the world. It will be essential to our wellbeing as a society and our overall resilience that as our population grows and becomes more culturally diverse, we continue to welcome newcomers and the diversity they bring.\nMelbourne's most multicultural municipalities are Greater Dandenong and Brimbank, where respectively 64 per cent and 56 per cent of residents speak a language other than English at home.22 Unfortunately, these municipalities also rank first and third in Victoria on the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) measure of disadvantage, indicating that establishing a prosperous life in Melbourne can be difficult for many people arriving from overseas.23\nGlobally and regionally connected\nWhat happens around the world is felt in Melbourne, and what we do here can affect people's lives far beyond our own city. We prosper thanks to our connections but when systems fail or events happen in places with which we trade and engage, our resilience may be threatened by those very linkages.\nMelbourne has been at the centre of numerous technological and scientific innovations that have improved lives across the world - the bionic ear, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and the \u2018black box' flight recorder all had their origins in Melbourne, to name just a few. We have also developed world-leading approaches to tackling social and environmental issues, such as in emergency management and water-sensitive urban design.\nWe are active in global programs that support resilience building. In addition to 100RC, Melbourne participates in the C40 Network, which connects cities around the world on climate change-related challenges.\nThe UN Global Cities Compact Programme is also managed from Melbourne and we host ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) for the Oceania region. We look to use these networks to assist not just Melbourne but a broad range of other countries and their cities.\nMelbourne is connected to global economic trends through trade, people and the flow of information.\nOur increasing links to Asia present significant opportunities, as a growing Asian middle class comes to Melbourne seeking high quality produce, education, healthcare and holiday destinations. But this level of global connectedness also brings some risks, by making Melbourne vulnerable to economic events and trends overseas, such as the recent slowing of growth in China.\nLloyds Risk Register has identified an international market collapse as the greatest threat to Melbourne's insurable gross domestic product. Cyber-crime, which can originate anywhere in the world, was ranked second.24\nMetropolitan Melbourne is highly dependent on other parts of Victoria, as well as on other cities and states in Australia. For instance, 41 per cent of Melbourne's fresh produce is currently grown within 100 kilometres of the city, but as urban development spreads outwards to accommodate population growth, the resulting loss of agricultural land could reduce this figure to 18 per cent by 2050.25 The current trend is towards greater reliance on produce from interstate and overseas, which exposes Melbourne to longer supply chains that are more vulnerable to shocks such as severe weather, extreme currency fluctuations and political unrest.\nMelbourne is also heavily reliant on activities outside the metropolitan area for its energy supply.26 Existing energy sources, notably brown coal mined and burned in the La Trobe Valley to generate electricity, contribute directly to environmental stresses. The grid that this energy fuels is further vulnerable to shocks in the form of extreme events, whether natural or man-made.\nActive in building resilience\nWe build our resilience in many ways, directly and indirectly, consciously and otherwise. Our future resilience will be determined by how well we unite and integrate efforts and investments.\nIn addition to the international networks highlighted above, resilience-building in Melbourne is fundamentally influenced by policies at Commonwealth, state and local government levels, and across a number of ministerial portfolios and agencies. These policies are undergoing significant reform. Australia is shifting its focus on managing and responding to emergencies, to proactively building resilience, as shown by the 2011 National Strategy for Disaster Resilience.27 The importance of cities to Australia's future was recognised by the appointment, in 2015, of a federal minister for cities and the built environment. 28\nAt the state government level, Plan Melbourne,\nMelbourne's metropolitan planning strategy, is currently being refreshed to incorporate responses to climate change, lack of affordable housing and infrastructure\ncommitments.29 Plan Melbourne is part of a web of\nreviews and initiatives such as regional growth plans, precinct structure plan guidelines, open space and boulevard plans, and the Yarra River strategies.\nThe recently created Infrastructure Victoria is initiating a consultation process to begin developing a 30-year infrastructure strategy for Victoria (page 137 describes this aligned local action in more detail).\nAt the local government level, each of Melbourne's 32 councils has a range of strategies that, together, contribute to Melbourne's overall resilience. Every council has a council plan, municipal health and wellbeing plan, municipal emergency management plan, and a planning scheme. Most councils also publish documents on specific issues, such as economic development strategies and climate change adaptation plans.\nMelbourne's multiplicity of councils enables each municipality to tailor its activities to suit its local community. Councils also regularly collaborate on important issues, often forming regional groupings (for example, the Inner Melbourne Action Plan and Lead West). But we may still be missing opportunities to implement more effective and efficient solutions\navailable on different scales. Councils are at the front\nline in tackling problems - such as the effects of social exclusion and isolation - that cross municipal boundaries. The cooperative approach promoted by Resilient Melbourne can be a catalyst for better coordinating these efforts across multiple municipalities.\nWe need to coordinate and act better together because despite all of the attention to resilience-building by government, many businesses and community organisations, we continue to face significant chronic stresses and acute shocks, as described in the following pages.\n\u201c This is a rare and unique opportunity to think and act collectively.\nThe impact of our decisions will be seen in decades to come.\u201d\nTracey Slatter,\nChief Executive Officer,\nCity of Port Phillip\nFaced with chronic stresses\nDespite our many efforts and relative wealth overall, as a city we face stresses that weaken the fabric of our society, further entrench disadvantage, and may trigger the shocks of the future. Chronic stresses act like \u2018shock amplifiers', increasing both their likelihood and the harm they cause.\nRAPID POPULATION GROWTH\nBetween 2006 and 2011, Growth Area councils on Melbourne's fringe (Casey, Cardinia, Hume, Melton, Whittlesea and Wyndham) grew by 183,726 people\n-\t50 per cent of metropolitan Melbourne's total population growth.30 A mixture of high birth rates -80 babies are born each week to Wyndham families\n-\tand migration make Whittlesea and Wyndham Australia's two fastest-growing municipalities, with Casey and Melton also in the top ten.31\nRapid population growth makes it more difficult to provide adequate infrastructure and services, and increases the pressure on the city's outer regions in particular. The rate and scale of development is testing our natural environment and the benefits it provides, such as clean air, climate regulation, water filtration and recreational opportunities.\nAlthough recent research undertaken for Resilient Melbourne, as well as annual surveys conducted by the Scanlon Foundation, show that Melbourne has relatively high levels of social cohesion,32 there is a concern that our current development is inadequately integrating new arrivals into established neighbourhoods and opportunities.\nA CHANGING ECONOMY AND\nHIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT\nIn parallel with a growing population, our economy is moving away from its traditional manufacturing past. While Melbourne is still home to some of Australia's significant manufacturers, our economy is becoming more knowledge and service-based, with strengths in finance, healthcare and education. For instance, among all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, Australia in 2014 had the highest proportion of international students enrolled in its tertiary institutions.33 Melbourne is home to some of Australia's largest universities, education services are a major industry and International students are now a significant part of Melbourne's multicultural population.\nThe shift away from manufacturing has resulted in higher unemployment, particularly in the south east (7.7 per cent) and northwest (8.1 per cent) of the city.34 Further advances in digital technology and\nautomation are expected to cause the loss of even\nmore manufacturing jobs in coming years - analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) indicates that 39 per cent of Melbourne's workers are currently in jobs at risk of disappearing.35\nAdditionally, income disparity in Australia grew consistently between 1995 and 2012.36 This corresponds with rising median house prices across Melbourne, less access to the property market, as well as increasing homelessness, as shown to the right.\nPRESSURES ON OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM\nThe stresses caused by economic inequality and geographic disadvantage can lead to other stresses, such as increased traffic congestion and longer commuting times. Along with factors such as employment vulnerability, these stresses correlate with higher frequency of alcoholism and a 62 per cent increase in reported family violence incidents since 2010-11.40 This reflects an interdependency of problems that we must tackle if we are to reduce the serious consequences of these stresses.\nAdditionally, Melbourne's population is ageing, and we are seeing increasing rates of preventable illnesses.\nIf current trends continue, it is estimated that more than 30 per cent of 5-19 year olds will be overweight or obese by 2025, as well as 83 per cent of males and 75 per cent of females aged 20 years and over.41 These trends place significant strains on our healthcare system. For the period from 2002-03 to 2032-33, annual health expenditure for diabetes across Australia is expected to increase by 401 per cent, from $1.4 billion to $7 billion, largely owing to higher rates of obesity.42 Increasing rates of mental illness will also contribute - in Victoria, the current economic cost of mental illness has been estimated at $5.4 billion per year, of which half ($2.7 billion) represents lost productivity and workforce participation.43\nVulnerable to acute shocks\nMelbourne is exposed to natural disasters such as extreme heat, bushfires and floods, and emerging shocks like disease pandemics and extremist acts. As our city grows and is also affected by climate change, we need to be prepared for multiple shocks to occur at once.\nNATURAL DISASTERS\nThe cost of natural disasters in Victoria is significant.\nDamage caused by floods in the Port Phillip and\nWesternport catchments alone is estimated at\napproximately $400 million per year, while the total\ncost of natural disasters between 2003 and 2013 has\nbeen valued as high as $19.9 billion.44\nThe National Strategy for Disaster Resilience notes that most disasters - although seeming to be sudden or unexpected events - begin slowly, because they usually arise from environmental conditions that create vulnerability to a triggering event. For example, between 1995 and 2009 Melbourne experienced a severe drought that significantly reduced reserves of potable water, as well as creating low soil-moisture levels and extremely dry vegetation.45 The chronic stress of drought placed extreme pressure on agricultural industries and created ideal conditions for bushfires.\nThen, in 2009 several devastating shocks occurred concurrently: the Black Saturday bushfires killed 173 people, destroyed thousands of homes, and disrupted power supplies to nearly 500,000 people, while the accompanying heatwave was linked with 374 more deaths due to heat-related illness.46 In late 2010 and early 2011, heavy rain from the west brought some of the worst floods ever seen in this part of the world.47 Climate change, population growth and urban development will make these kinds of events more frequent, more severe, and will affect more people.\nMelbourne also experiences the indirect effects of natural disasters elsewhere in our region - for example, floods in agricultural areas can inflate food prices, and fire crews based in Melbourne's east are regularly called on to tackle bushfires in rural areas.\nNot only do shock events harm those most vulnerable, they can also create their own stress consequences. The Australian Business Roundtable for Disaster Resilience and Safer Communities notes that the social costs of natural disasters \u2018tend to persist over a person's lifetime, while most tangible costs are one-off'.48 Following shock events, we find notably increased rates of mental illness, family violence and suicide, often some years after families or communities appear to have recovered from the event.\nHUMAN-DRIVEN SHOCKS\nPandemic influenza is Victoria's third-highest priority emergency risk.49 Aside from the obvious health ramifications, pandemics have the potential to cripple Melbourne's economy, particularly given the high concentration of employment in inner Melbourne municipalities. For instance, the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 (Swine Flu) was estimated to have reduced Australia's gross domestic product by as much as 1.3 per cent, due to workplace absenteeism and lower business investment, even though fewer than 1,000 cases of the illness were reported across Australia.50\nTransport infrastructure emergencies are also a major risk for Melbourne.51 The full closure of the CityLink, Burnley and Domain tunnels in October 2012 due to a technical failure showed how such incidents can cascade through our city systems, testing the extent of redundancy, i.e. additional capacity to cope with unexpected circumstances, in our transport network, and leading to widespread congestion across all major modes of transport (road, rail, tram, bus). Our rapid population growth, increasing demand for transport, ageing infrastructure and greater incidence of extreme weather events will all contribute to these risks.\nOver the coming years we will also face new types of shocks caused by humans. For instance, Lloyd's City Risk Index ranks cyber-crime as Melbourne's second-greatest threat to insurable gross domestic product ($3.87 billion), ahead of floods and disease pandemics.52\nMELBOURNE'S\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVES\nResilient Melbourne has identified four long-term (30 years or more) resilience objectives. For each of these, local government can take a leading role, in partnership with other sectors. Even more importantly, we agreed to concentrate on tackling our chronic stresses and developing actions that will make Melbourne stronger and more resilient whatever shocks we may face, rather than focusing on particular shock events.\nOur long-term objectives\nAll Resilient Melbourne objectives are interdependent.\nTo be truly resilient our people must support each other and must have places that encourage this support.\nThis requires a strong economy, so we can invest in infrastructure and services across our entire city and to give all our citizens opportunities to generate income. And all of this will be affected - for better or worse - by the state of our natural environment.\nTo read more about the process for determining the four resilience objectives, and Resilient Melbourne more broadly, visit our website: www.resilientmelbourne.com.au\/\n\u201c We need to collaborate as a group of metropolitan councils, and also collaborate with state government and private industry.

However, research undertaken by Resilient Melbourne found that only 41 per cent of Melburnians are confident that their neighbourhood would pull together in an emergency, and only 39 per cent believe that most people in their neighbourhood can be trusted.53\nThis suggests that we are not as cohesive as we imagine. Such perceptions place increased pressure on our emergency services by reducing community selfreliance. With a less certain future and more extreme events likely, equipping our citizens to be more selfreliant and mutually supportive is likely to be crucial for their and the city's resilience.\nIn the past, Australia focused its efforts almost exclusively on responding to the after-effects of disasters, rather than on preventing or mitigating disasters before they happen. A recent report by the Australian Government Productivity Commission found that 97 per cent of disaster funding is spent on response activities, while the Australian Business Roundtable for Disaster Resilient and Safer Communities suggests that investing in disaster preparedness and resilience-building could reduce government disaster response budgets by 50 per cent.54\nThe emphasis needs to be on \u2018with' the community. Community is at the heart of resilience. Sure there is emergency management, urban planning and other aspects, but\nbuilding community resilience and\nworking with community is core.\u201d\nFrank Archer,\nDirector,\nMonash University Disaster Resilience Initiative\nWe are fortunate to have governments that are able to respond to disaster events. However, this is contributing to a common perception that our safety and preparedness are someone else's responsibility, and that governments can always be relied upon to come to the aid of those who do not plan ahead. We need our communities to be better able to recognise the hazards they face, to plan to manage risks and their consequences for themselves and their broader communities, supported by certainty that governments will always help the most vulnerable and those who are simply unfortunate.\nThis phenomenon of under-preparedness is\ndemonstrated by widespread under-insurance among Australians. Research by the Insurance Council of Australia found that 81 per cent of homeowners and renters do not have sufficient insurance cover to resume the same standard of living following a crisis; this is also true of many small to medium business enterprises.55\nMelbourne's Preliminary Resilience Assessment identified greater self-reliance and personal responsibility as important factors in easing pressure on our healthcare system.56 While all levels of government have responsibilities to create and maintain conditions that give people control over their lives, at present, many community, market and government structures do not encourage this. All too frequently we deliver services in ways that lead to dependence, rather than fostering capacity and empowering our citizens.\nIn keeping with the approach of the Victorian Government, and of many councils, Resilient Melbourne acknowledges that social factors such as education, income and access to open spaces are crucial to a person's capacity to lead a healthy lifestyle.\nIn contributing to this objective, we will support\nactions that:\n\u2022\thelp us understand what motivates communities and individuals to be more proactive about each other's wellbeing\nUnderstanding the drivers of community resilience on page 94.\n\u2022\tdevelop new ways of operating that empower communities to be more active in their safety and wellbeing\n!\u2014\u25ba An emergency management community resilience framework for Victoria on page 90.\n\u2022\tbuild new community networks, and strengthen existing ones\nThe Neighbourhood Project on page 74.\n\u2022\thelp people at risk of exclusion form strong social bonds\n-\u25ba Multicultural water safety and settlement\non page 98.\n*\u2014\u25ba Young and Resilient living labs on page 126.\n\u2022\tmake insurance affordable for more people Innovative insurance on page 104.\nOur shared places\nCreate and sustain buildings, infrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity and health\nWHY IS THIS OBJECTIVE IMPORTANT?\nThe OECD defines a socially cohesive society as one that \u2018works towards the wellbeing of all its members, fights exclusion and marginalisation, creates a sense of belonging, promotes trust and offers its members the opportunity of upward mobility'.57 Members of socially cohesive communities are better equipped to support one another through good times and bad.\nMelbourne's physical form plays a major role in the cohesiveness of its communities. Affordable and suitable housing - a United Nations-recognised basic human right - efficient transport networks, and community infrastructure (including healthcare, educational facilities and recreational spaces) are all essential for building and maintaining social cohesion.\nProviding infrastructure to support cohesive\ncommunities is a challenge for all of Melbourne, not only in its most disadvantaged areas, as highlighted\non pages 22-23.\nFor instance, Southbank in the central business district is now home to more than 11,000 residents, most living in high-rise buildings, but the postcode has no school, bank or post office.58 While Southbank benefits from its close proximity to the amenities of the central business district and South Melbourne, in some cases this kind of development can result in socially isolated residents, who have inadequate support networks to improve their everyday quality of life, or to turn to in times of need.\nWhile providing adequate and equitable access to infrastructure is a major goal for Melbourne's resilience, we must also think about the activities and behaviours that lead to cohesive, fair and healthy communities\n-\tand how we can promote them. In 2010, the Grattan Institute examined the decision-making arrangements of successful cities. It concluded that \u2018high and sustained levels of public engagement in decision-making'\nand collaboration across different sectors of society are crucial. 59\nCohesive communities are also better able to share resources and support each other in response to shocks and stresses. Following extreme events, cohesive communities make the means to survive and thrive\n-\tparticularly capital and skills - available more quickly and to more people.\n\u201c On the one hand, we need to make\nresilience easy - something people can be proud of and do as part of day-to-day life. On the other, we also need to have hard conversations with community about planning. It's a long game - a 40 to 50 year game.\u201d\nKate Siebert,\nExecutive Officer,\nEmergency & Community Safety,\nYarra Ranges Shire Council\nBelow, from left: 2013 Reclink Community Cup - an annual Australian Rules football match held in Elsternwick; Members of the Young and Well CRC Youth Brains Trust.\nIn contributing to this objective, we will support\nactions that:\n\u2022\ttrial new ways of providing community infrastructure and services, such as housing, transport and energy\nI\u2014\u25ba New apartments trial for social housing residents on page 78.\n\u2022\tcreate opportunities by working together and sharing resources in good times and bad\n!\"\u25ba Local government renewables group purchasing on page 82.\n\u2022\tactively involve citizens and communities in making decisions\nI\u2014\u25ba Community-led neighbourhood renewal and development pilot projects on page 116.\n\u2022\tuse urban form to encourage greater social interactions\nI\u2014\u25ba Community-led neighbourhood renewal and development pilot projects on page 116.\n\u2022\tcreate spaces that enable people to come together to tackle shared challenges\nYoung and Resilient living labs on page 126.\nLEARNING FROM OTHERS - SOCIAL COHESION IN CHICAGO'S HEATWAVE60\nWhen a heatwave struck Chicago in 1995, two neighbourhoods - Auburn Gresham and Englewood - had almost identical demographic profiles.\nWhile both communities were exposed to similar heat, a built environment that fostered community connections meant that Auburn Gresham residents were more likely to check on each other, particularly on vulnerable and elderly people. Englewood, on the other hand, was experiencing a prolonged period of economic and physical decline, as well as lower levels of social cohesion.\nThe death rates from the heat wave were\ndramatically different: Englewood suffered 33 deaths per 100,000 people, while Auburn Gresham had just 3 deaths per 100,000. This shows how strong, connected communities can reduce harm caused by the shock events that will inevitably affect cities. This is a particularly instructive example for Melburnians as we face a future with more frequent and intense extreme heat events as a result of climate change.\nALIGNED LOCAL ACTION\nResilient Melbourne will work with the CSIRO\n(Australia's national science agency) to conduct an initial assessment of a range of metropolitan systems and their exposure to heat stress. The assessment will include local transport networks, healthcare systems, energy and water utilities, and other local support networks, including interdependencies between them. It will provide a scientific basis for councils to understand risk, and will assist inform recommendations to reduce vulnerability and support integrated planning and decision-making.\nBelow, from top: One of several community-led parklet projects across Melbourne; Launched in 2010, the Melbourne Bike Share network has 600 bicycles operating from 51 stations from\nCollingwood to St Kilda.\nABOUT THIS PROJECT'S 100RC PLATFORM PARTNER\nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is Australia's national science agency. CSIRO research initiatives use science to solve real issues that make a difference to people, industry and the planet.\nThrough CSIRO's \u2018City Engines' web-based tool, cities can integrate climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction into action plans for more resilient cities. Through risk management, it aims to guide city partners to identify options that reduce the impact of climate change and variability.\nA dynamic economy\nProvide diverse local employment opportunities that support an adaptable workforce that is ready for the jobs of the future.\nWHY IS THIS OBJECTIVE IMPORTANT?\nProviding employment opportunities is critical to\nincreasing the resilience of our city as a whole, as\nwell as that of particular communities and individuals.\nEmployment creates bonds based on common interests,\nand widens support networks. It enables us to buy\nservices such as insurance, and provides income we\ncan use to recover from shock events. Opportunities\nfor diverse and fulfilling employment also help reduce\na range of chronic stresses, such as homelessness,\npoverty, mental illness and domestic violence.\nAs described on page 30, Melbourne's economy is moving away from a heavy manufacturing past, towards higher-skilled jobs. For this reason, we need a workforce equipped to work in emerging industries, some of which may not yet even exist. Governments are increasingly aware that businesses competing in a global economy need more employees proficient in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Although 75 per cent of Australia's fastest-growing occupations now require these skills, the number of STEM university graduates is not increasing, the number of graduating high school students (Year 12) studying STEM subjects is declining, and businesses are struggling to find STEM-skilled employees.61\nMore generally, schools that are accessible to local communities are fundamental infrastructure to support this objective. Melbourne's rapid growth in particular locations, such as inner city and fringe areas, needs to be complemented with new schools.\nThe PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report,\nA Smart Move, predicted that shifting 1 per cent of Australia's workforce into science, technology, engineering and mathematics roles would add $57.4 billion to gross domestic product (net present value over 20 years).62\nAlthough Melbourne has an extensive heavy rail system and the world's largest tram network by track length, where a person lives significantly influences their access to jobs.63 Today, fewer than 10 per cent of employees in outer-ring municipalities work within 10 kilometres of home. This has contributed to a stretching of the peak commuting periods, making it harder to avoid traffic congestion when travelling to and from work.64 Studies have linked lengthy commutes to ill health, including higher stress levels and lack of sleep.65 Resilient Melbourne recognises that these trends pose a risk to Melbourne's future resilience and encourages actions that will improve economic activities across our metropolitan area.\nAbove, from top: A Monash University biochemistry laboratory; Members of the Young and Well CRC brains trust.\nIn contributing to this objective, we will support actions that:\n\u2022\tgive Melburnians the right skills for the jobs of the future\nSTEM mentoring Melbourne on page 130.\n\u2022\thelp address societal challenges while equipping people to generate an income\n\u25ba Young and Resilient living labs on page 126.\n\u2022\tpromote a broader spread of successful new and small and medium-sized enterprises across Melbourne's entire metropolitan area, encouraging small employment clusters and service centres, as described in Plan Melbourne\nInnovative business models on page 134.\n\u201c By providing Melburnians with opportunities to gain relevant and transferrable skills, we are preparing our communities and economy to survive and thrive in the face of a changing global marketplace.\u201d\nChris Eddy,\nChief Executive Officer,\nHobsons Bay City Council\nGraphic output from the Resilient Melbourne Accelerated Design Forum (\u2018A competitive metropolis' discovery area), held in August 2015.\n48\nMELBOURNE'S RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES\nTHE 100RC GLOBAL\nNETWORK IN ACTION\nNine 100RC cities are focusing on creating prosperous communities in post-industrial economies. Despite our different histories and geographies, we all have shared experiences that can help each of our cities solve entrenched challenges.\nCities currently involved are Boulder, Bristol, Christchurch, Durban, Glasgow, Melbourne, Pittsburgh, Rotterdam and Vejle.\nA healthier environment\nEnable strong natural assets and ecosystems alongside a growing population.\nWHY IS THIS OBJECTIVE IMPORTANT?\nAlthough our unique natural environment poses threats such as bushfires and floods, we also directly rely on it for our livelihoods and wellbeing. Melbourne's parks, forests, gardens and wetlands help clean the air we breathe, reduce noise, regulate the climate, filter water, and give us places for recreation, to name just a few.\nThe Plan Melbourne Refresh Discussion Paper recognises that our non-urban areas provide important amenity and have inherent natural value, as well as supporting industries such as tourism, food production and horticulture. It states clearly that these areas should not be considered \u2018vacant land awaiting urban development'. These are just some of the reasons why people are increasingly valuing the economic benefits of our natural environment, in addition to its inherent value.\nDespite such awareness, our natural assets are coming under increasing pressure as more development is needed to support our growing population. Rezoning and infill development are increasing population densities in inner and middle Melbourne, while new residential and industrial developments in outer areas often require clearing of remnant grassland, woodland or arable land. These trends are contributing to problems such as higher urban temperatures, increased runoff, and greater pressure on drainage infrastructure.\nMelbourne faces these problems in the context of increasing pressures from climate change (p. 53). Research by Monash University has shown that maximum temperatures of 29 degrees Celsius and above increase the rate of heat-related illness and death in people over 64 years of age.68 Melbourne is a coastal\nThe urban forest in the City of Melbourne alone was recently valued at $700 million - this accounts for the natural services these trees provide, as well as factors such as the increase in nearby property values.67\ncity; over time, rising sea levels will cause erosion and inundation that will damage our coastal areas, while at the same time more and more people are competing for access to this coastal land. 69\nProtecting our natural assets saves money in the long run. Once a natural asset is lost, it is expensive, and in many cases impossible, to recreate or recover it. Such losses increase our reliance on hard infrastructure - for example, expensive sea walls to protect us against storm surges once natural systems such as mangroves are lost.\nIn contributing to this objective, we will support actions that:\nextend and link existing efforts to strengthen our natural assets and the ecosystem services they provide\nMetropolitan urban forest strategy on page 62.\npromote new and cost-effective ways to manage our natural resources more efficiently and reduce environmental damage\nIntegrated water management framework\non page 68.\nexplore imaginative ways to put nature back into communities\nThe Neighbourhood Project on page 74.\nTHE 100RC GLOBAL\nNETWORK IN ACTION\nIn an effort to strengthen their natural assets, several 100RC cities, including Melbourne and Durban, are sharing their experiences and innovative approaches to understanding the links between climate change, water and biodiversity, and better ways both to protect biodiversity and to use nature to provide hard infrastructure services such as flood defences.\nBelow, from left: A pelican soars above the Western Treatment Plant, which is an internationally significant wetland visited each year by many migratory species; Graphic output from the Resilient Melbourne Accelerated Design Forum (\u2018A healthier environment' discovery area), held in August 2015.\nURBAN HEAT, FLOODING AND OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nVulnerability to heatwaves\nThis map shows vulnerability of residents to extreme heat events. Vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity of the exposed population, and capacity to adapt.\nUrban green spaces play a key role in cooling our city and reducing exposure to heatwaves.

They are a starting point for exploring new ways of working that will build our resilience for decades to come. The actions will\nachieve long-term benefits in ways that can be implemented now.\nAll actions are relevant to, but not necessarily owned by, local government. In investigating actions that will help achieve our vision, four clear action areas emerged. These action areas keep our communities at the centre of everything we are seeking to achieve, describing the different ways we will meet our objectives, building\nMelbourne's resilience against all potential shocks and stresses. They require an interdisciplinary focus, delivering multiple benefits and breaking out of narrower, more traditional structures such as \u2018society, economy and environment'.\nTODAY, TOMORROW AND TOGETHER, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO:\nBuilding on existing structures and efforts\nMelbourne is home to many passionate individuals and innovative organisations already helping communities to adapt, survive and thrive in the face of shocks and stresses. This strategy builds on their efforts by bringing successful actions and practices to a wider audience, as well as linking together those who may be taking similar approaches in isolation from one another.\nThe actions in this strategy are all directly supported by Resilient Melbourne. While implementation of some actions will be led by the Resilient Melbourne Delivery\nOffice, most will be led by partners across community, academic and business sectors, as well as local and state government agencies.\nBy working together on these actions, partners will improve Melbourne's collective resilience and will learn by doing; delivering tangible benefits for Melbourne's communities while simultaneously generating new knowledge on how best to build resilience.\nImplementing the actions\nResilient Melbourne must contribute to Melbourne's resilience quickly and tangibly. For each action described in this section, we have identified action leads, partners and initial funding sources. Selected projects will also receive significant support from one or more 100RC Platform Partners. These partners are leading service providers that offer in-kind support to members of the 100RC network.\nWe are currently creating implementation plans -monitoring and evaluation will be built into each action from the start. Each plan will include preliminary indicators for measuring results, which will be reviewed before starting.\nThe Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will oversee the implementation of this first Resilient Melbourne strategy. This approach is supported by the 32 councils of Melbourne, led by the City of Melbourne, Emergency Management Victoria (EMV), the Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV), the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), and the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC).\nWe have identified three flagship actions. These have the potential to move us significantly towards achieving our vision of a more resilient Melbourne: viable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous, today and for the long term.\nOur three flagship actions are a metropolitan urban forest strategy (p. 62), emergency management community resilience approach for Victoria (p. 90) and metropolitan cycling network (p. 112).\nIS YOUR CITY OR ORGANISATION INTERESTED\nIN GETTING INVOLVED IN ANY OF OUR ACTIONS?\nWe welcome technical partners, co-sponsors and cities interested in learning from, or contributing to, this work - please contact resilience@melbourne.vic.gov.au\nADAPT\nA resilient and adaptive Melbourne will look for ways to reduce our exposure to shocks and stresses that are an increasing part of everyday life.\nIn an adaptive Melbourne, our institutions must be flexible and responsive to emerging information, regularly adjusting the way they deliver services as the pace of social, environmental and economic change in our city continues to accelerate. The needs of the future - such as housing for a growing and ageing population, making better use of nature's resources, and developing new skills - will not be met by sticking to old approaches.\nIndividuals and communities must also be adaptable in the face of rapid change. By providing access to education, information and knowledge, an adaptive Melbourne will give citizens the resources they need to become more resilient.\nALIGNED LOCAL ACTION\nNational Climate Resilience\nand Adaptation Strategy\nIn December 2015, the Australian Government released a National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy,70 which sets out how Australia is managing climate risks. It mentions Resilient Melbourne as a key project currently under way and notes that resilience-building can mean many things, such as limiting or removing human-caused pressures on natural systems (like land clearing or pollution), or giving vulnerable communities reliable access to information and essential services.\nIn addition to the work described in the actions, the Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office is now working with the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning to make sure we are consistent with Victoria's emerging climate adaptation strategy.\nExtend and link existing urban greening, reforestation and nature initiatives across Melbourne, to improve wellbeing and reduce our exposure to hazards such as heatwaves and flooding.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nMelbourne's liveability relies on a healthy natural environment for basic human needs such as clean air, fresh drinking water and a comfortable climate. However, the way our city is growing is putting these at risk.\nSome of Melbourne's local government areas already have among the lowest urban tree canopy ratios in Australia.71 Rezoning and infill development are resulting in less green space and higher population densities in inner and middle Melbourne. On Melbourne's fringes, new suburbs are being built on arable land and areas of remnant native vegetation. Where rain once soaked easily into permeable soils, reducing peak stream flows and the risk of flash floods, hard surfaces like roofs and roads now dominate. These same hard surfaces, unshaded by vegetation, also absorb the sun's heat -peak inner metropolitan temperatures are 7 degrees Celsius higher than those in surrounding rural areas.72\nThis is all occurring in the context of climate change, which will cause more frequent heatwaves, droughts and extreme rainfall. While the effects of these phenomena will be widespread, they disproportionately affect already vulnerable members of our communities, including older residents, people who are unwell, and those who are financially disadvantaged.73\nPRIMARY\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\nRELATED\nOBJECTIVES\nSTRESSES\nSHOCKS\nEnable strong natural assets and ecosystems alongside a growing population\nCreate and sustain buildings, infrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity, and health\n\u2022\tClimate change\n\u2022\tDevelopment pressures on ecosystem services\n\u2022\tHigher rates of chronic illness\n\u2022\tAgeing population\n\u2022\tIncreasing pressure on healthcare services\n\u2022\tDecreasing social equality\n\u2022\tLower rates of community participation\n\u2022\tFlood\n\u2022\tHeatwave\n\u2022\tDrought\n\u2022\tMarine pollution\nTHE ACTION\nAcross Melbourne, urban greening and revegetation\nprojects are being undertaken by local councils,\nwater authorities, community groups, and regional\ncollaborations such as Greening the West. Victorian\nGovernment agencies such as DELWP and Parks\nVictoria also play key roles in this area.\nThis action will result in a metropolitan urban forest\nstrategy for all of Melbourne. This strategy will enable\nall those currently involved, and others wanting to\ndeliver urban greening projects in future, to understand how their efforts can best contribute to improving ecosystem health and services such as urban cooling and flood mitigation. It will achieve this by:\n\u2022 highlighting how and where existing initiatives can be expanded\n\u2022 enabling the sharing of resources and knowledge by linking together currently disparate efforts\n\u2022 providing councils better information about their existing tree canopy cover, making resources available for public and private entities\n\u2022 providing opportunities for utility providers and infrastructure owners to address implementation barriers and help make Melbourne greener and cooler.\nTHE 100RC GLOBAL\nNETWORK IN ACTION\nIn the 100RC network, the city of Boulder,\nColorado, in the USA is also pursuing the benefits of city-wide greening. As part of this action, the Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will collaborate with Boulder and its Chief Resilience Officer to share approaches and information.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\nThe metropolitan urban forest strategy will bring city-wide benefits that cannot be achieved by individual councils, suburbs, infrastructure operators or\nneighbourhoods in isolation. Greening on a metropolitan\nscale could truly transform our city. In addition to a range of amenity and biodiversity benefits, from a resilience perspective, a greener Melbourne means:\n\u2022\tshadier, cooler metropolitan areas\n\u2022\tlower flood risk for people and assets\n\u2022\tless stormwater and nutrients entering waterways and Port Phillip Bay.\nThese also bring further benefits to communities.\nFor example, research has repeatedly shown that greener cities have lower levels of obesity and other chronic illnesses, higher levels of physical activity, and improved mental health.74\nThis action will link with and be supported by the Integrated Water Management action, described next\nLead: The Nature Conservancy (100RC Platform Partner)\n\u2022\tResilient Melbourne Delivery Office\n\u2022\tAll metropolitan councils\n\u2022\tTrimble (100RC Platform Partner)\n\u2022\tParks Victoria\n\u2022\tDepartment of Environment, Land, Water and Planning\n\u2022\tLead West\n\u2022\tHorticulture Innovation Australia and 202020 Vision\nBy December 2016:\n\u2022\tPartners set up project governance structure\n\u2022\tThe Nature Conservancy to coordinate collection of existing data from councils and state government agencies\n\u2022\tTrimble builds on existing data sets and supplements them using its proprietary geographic information systems\n\u2022\tThe Nature Conservancy and Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office explore innovative financing opportunities\nBy December 2017:\n\u2022\tThe Nature Conservancy to build on mapping and data sets to develop the metropolitan urban forest strategy for councils, state government agencies, households and community groups\n\u2022\tResilient Melbourne Delivery Office manages collaboration with partners to develop a strategy suitable for implementation across metropolitan Melbourne.\nABOUT THIS PROJECT'S 100RC PLATFORM PARTNERS\nThe Nature Conservancy is a leading conservation organisation, working around the world to protect ecologically important lands and waters for nature and people. It tackles threats to conservation involving climate change, fire, fresh water, forests, invasive species, and marine ecosystems.\nAs part of the 100RC Platform, The Nature Conservancy offers expertise in mapping, measuring and valuing the goods and services that nature provides. This allows decision makers to evaluate the trade-offs of alternative management choices, helping them pinpoint areas where investment in natural capital can benefit both human development and conservation.\nTrimble provides advanced positioning technology and mobile solutions. As part of the 100RC Platform, Trimble is providing access to its eCognition Essentials remote-sensing classification software, which can help cities better understand their current land-cover conditions and changes in land use.\nEnable better use of existing water resources, and reduce our exposure to drought and flood, by developing decision-support tools that encourage water-sensitive urban design and integrated water management.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nClimate change will exacerbate flooding in our urban areas, while lower annual rainfall and fewer days of rain will place further stress on our urban vegetation. Building yet more traditional storm drains and pipes is expensive and disruptive, while continuing to water trees and areas of vegetation during droughts is itself resource intensive, with regards water and labour, as well as financially.75\nExperience in places such as the Netherlands suggests that there are better ways to live with and harness water than through heavy engineering alone.76 New, integrated solutions will reduce the risks to safety and financial security of thousands of Melburnians in flood-prone areas, while smarter ways of retaining water in our urban landscape will support existing and future vegetation during times of drought.\nPRIMARY\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\nRELATED\nOBJECTIVES\nSTRESSES\nSHOCKS\nStrengthen our natural assets and ecosystems alongside a growing population\nCreate and sustain buildings, infrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity, and health\n\u2022\tDrought\n\u2022\tDevelopment pressures on ecosystem services\n\u2022\tFlooding\n\u2022\tHeatwaves\nTHE ACTION\nThis action will develop guidance and decision-making tools to better enable councils to expand the use of water-sensitive urban design and integrated water management techniques that are suited to their local contexts. These will build upon approaches already being applied in many parts of Melbourne, and work in conjunction with water authorities, other infrastructure operators and DELWP, which is currently developing a new water plan for Victoria.\nAdditionally the action will develop a common language and framework across different levels of government, enabling more coordinated approaches to managing water in different regions and sub-catchment areas.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\nThis action will improve councils' understanding of water-sensitive urban design and integrated water management techniques, helping them to:\n\u2022\tuse these approaches in their stormwater management plans, thus reducing flood risk, improving water security and leading to cooler and greener urban areas\n\u2022\tconserve potable water, allowing additional urban greening and bringing associated health benefits to local communities\n\u2022\tbring together disparate sets of data (normally collected for single purposes) to enable better analysis\n\u2022\tinvolve community groups from the first stages of planning water management projects, allowing them more of a say in the physical form of their community and the use of water resources\n\u2022\tmake public the costs and benefits of managing water - both to the community and government.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nPARTNERS NEXT STEPS\nLeads: Manningham City Council and the CRC (Cooperative Research Centre)\nfor Water Sensitive Cities\n\u2022 Participating metropolitan councils\n\u2022 Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning\n\u2022 Melbourne Water, City West Water, South East Water, Yarra Valley Water\n\u2022\tVictoria University - developers of the Local Government Economic Framework for Green Infrastructure\n\u2022\tMonash Sustainability Institute\nBy October 2016:\n\u2022\tCRC for Water Sensitive Cities holds a meeting of decision makers from the principal water sector organisations, including water authorities and retailers, to agree on targets and allocate responsibilities.\n\u2022\tCRC for Water Sensitive Cities and Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office considers ways to attract additional partners.\nBy December 2016:\n\u2022\tInitial development of the guidance and decision-support tool.

Melbourne's development has placed the bay under stress, and bayside municipalities will face an increasing number of shock events originating in the bay, such as coastal storm surges and flooding from sea-level rise.\nMany of the actions required to protect Port Phillip Bay rely on a coordinated effort across councils and all levels of government. But not all areas of Melbourne fully understand how activities that occur upstream affect the health of the bay, or the threats posed by climate change.\nIn response, Victoria's 10 bayside councils formed the Association of Bayside Municipalities (ABM) to coordinate their efforts. They have begun work\non a regional coastal adaptation framework that will protect Port Phillip Bay's value for tomorrow. To date, a document describing the present situation has been prepared. A discussion paper will then provide a basis for consulting bayside councils and other parties. An exploration of adaptation options will include a high-level risk screening of potential hazards and impacts.\nThe Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will look to work with the ABM and its project partners to support the implementation of identified resiliencebuilding actions, including addressing the impacts of upstream regions on the health of the Bay.\nThrough training and building capacity, this initiative will help community groups\ntransform under-used land around Melbourne into a network of new public spaces.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nMany Melburnians lack easy access to basic community infrastructure, such as parks and playgrounds. This diminishes people's health and wellbeing and reduces social cohesion. With a growing population and constrained natural and financial resources, we need to provide the community infrastructure that fosters social cohesion, equal opportunity and liveability.\nDespite pressures on available space, up to 30 per cent of land in Australian cities remains vacant or under-used.77 While such spaces have the potential collectively to comprise a large network of community spaces, council processes and limited resources can deter people from harnessing them for community benefit and use.\nPRIMARY\tCreate and sustain buildings,\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\tinfrastructure and activities that\npromote social cohesion, equality of opportunity and health\nRELATED\tEmpower communities to take\nOBJECTIVES\nactive responsibility for their own and each other's wellbeing, safety and health\nEnable strong natural assets and ecosystems alongside a growing population\nSTRESSES\t\u2022 Lower rates of community\nparticipation\n\u2022\tDecreasing social equality\n\u2022\tClimate change\n\u2022\tDevelopment pressures on ecosystem services\nSHOCKS\t\u2022 Greater community cohesion\nand access to open space builds resilience to a range of shocks\nTHE ACTION\nThe Neighbourhood Project will provide 12 months of capacity building, resources and mentoring to participating communities in how to turn under-used land into green spaces. This will include training in design\nand project management.\nThe Neighbourhood Project will also tackle barriers that impede community-led place-making projects, such as planning scheme requirements. It will work with councils to better understand and remove these barriers, while still ensuring that councils can fulfil their legal and public safety obligations.\nThe action will transform 24 under-used spaces in 8 neighbourhoods into useful community public spaces, using a \u2018tactical urbanism' methodology.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\n\u2022\tA more active citizenry and stronger social networks will make community groups better able to carry out community infrastructure projects in the future.\n\u2022\tIt is estimated that approximately 12,000 people will benefit indirectly from improvements to their neighbourhoods.\n\u2022\tCouncils will be better able to help create public open space, rather than just regulate it.\nPlay Streets allow neighbourhoods to close streets to non-local traffic for a day of free, unstructured activity like street cricket and child's play.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nPARTNERS\tNEXT STEPS\nLead: CoDesign Studio\n\u2022\tResilient Melbourne Delivery Office\n\u2022\tMunicipal Association of Victoria\n\u2022\tParticipating metropolitan councils\n\u2022\tCommunity groups and community members\n\u2022\tMyer Foundation\nApril-May 2016:\n\u2022\tFollowing the launch of the expression of interest process at Resilient Melbourne's meeting of metropolitan mayors and their CEOs in April 2016, applications for projects are now being submitted to CoDesign Studio.\nBy July 2016:\n\u2022 Identify the first participating councils. Initial projects to run 2016-19.\nThe Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will support efforts to replicate a new development that puts home ownership within reach of more public housing tenants.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nVictoria's 65,000 social and community dwellings (\u2018public housing') are lifelines for some of Melbourne's\nmost vulnerable people. However, there is a serious\nshortage of supply - at present the waiting time for public housing is approximately 11 years, and with little new stock being developed, this is unlikely to shorten.78\nNationally, the deficit of affordable housing for low- to middle-income households was estimated at 211,000 dwellings in 2011, up from 138,000 in 2006.79 Assuming historic demographic and supply trends continue, this gap will increase to nearly 370,000 dwellings by the end of 2016, and 663,000 by 2031.\nThere are many success stories in Melbourne's social and community housing sector - individuals and families who have improved their economic circumstances to the point where home ownership is within reach. However, with much of Melbourne's social and community housing stock located in inner city areas with high property values, it is extremely difficult for residents to afford suitably sized accommodation in a similar area, close to their existing social networks and employment. This can result in these individuals remaining in social housing indefinitely, or buying homes in more affordable outer suburban areas, where they have no community connections.\nTHE ACTION\nThe Melbourne Apartments Project (MAP) will put home ownership within reach of more public housing tenants and provide a funding stream for the development of further similar projects. A pilot project is already under way at one site in inner Melbourne, where new two- and three-bedroom apartments are being offered solely to social housing tenants who meet specific eligibility criteria. Having assessed this approach, we believe it could be replicated in a number of areas around Melbourne, and the Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office is working with partners to identify sites and funding for further developments.\nPRIMARY\tCreate and sustain buildings,\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\tinfrastructure and activities that\npromote social cohesion, equality of opportunity, and health\nRELATED\tStronger together\nOBJECTIVES\nSTRESSES\t\u2022 Decreasing social equality\n\u2022\tWorsening housing affordability\n\u2022\tUnemployment\nSHOCKS\tHaving safe and affordable housing\nbuilds resilience to a range of shocks, such as heatwaves and disease pandemics\nThe current pilot project is being run on a not-for-profit basis.

On any night, one in 200 Australians are homeless; almost 80 per cent of them own a smartphone. Ask Izzy allows people to search more than 350,000 services across Australia, anonymously.\nAsk Izzy has been designed by people who are or have been homeless, and developed in partnership with not-for-profit group Infoxchange, Google, realestate.com.au, News Corp Australia, and more than 20 other partners.\nThis action will enable participating councils to invest in renewable energy, thus diversifying energy sources and shifting to cleaner technologies.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nMelbourne is heavily reliant on electricity generated\nin the Latrobe Valley, which leaves us vulnerable to\nenergy disruptions from shock events such as bushfires, blackouts during heatwaves and acts of sabotage.80 Diversifying the sources of electricity supplying\nMelbourne's grid, while increasing renewable generation, can help reduce this reliance, and will bring health benefits from less burning of coal.\nAdditionally, we must tackle the chronic stresses of\nclimate change and the more frequent and intense\nshock events it is causing. For this reason reducing our\ngreenhouse gas emissions by increasing the proportion\nof renewable power in our energy mix is a resilience\nissue. Councils wish to take action, but individual\ncouncils are often too small to make cost-effective\npurchases or to negotiate effectively.\nPRIMARY\tCreate and sustain buildings,\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\tinfrastructure and activities that\npromote social cohesion, equality of opportunity and health\nRELATED Empower communities to take\nOBJECTIVES\nactive responsibility for their own and each other's wellbeing, safety and health\nEnable strong natural assets and ecosystems alongside a growing population\nSTRESSES\t\u2022 Climate change\n\u2022 Development pressures on\necosystem services\nSHOCKS \u2022 Electricity supply disruption \u2022 Heatwave \u2022 Bushfire \u2022 Terrorism \u2022 Infrastructure failure\nTHE ACTION\nThis action builds on a pilot project led by the cities of Melbourne, Moreland, Port Phillip and Yarra.

As part of Resilient Melbourne, local government\nis exploring opportunities to build on local strong\nconnections with TAFEs and upper secondary\nschools to extend the work led by NCAT into other tertiary and further education colleges and upper secondary schools across metropolitan Melbourne.\nSURVIVE\nA resilient Melbourne must be equipped to withstand disruptions, and bounce back from them better than before.\nAn adaptive Melbourne seeks to avoid and minimise\nthe effects of disruptions. But there will be some\nshocks that we cannot prevent. Our communities and\nsystems must be able to deal with these, collectively\nand as individuals.\nLEARNING FROM OTHERS - WELLINGTON REGION EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICE (WREMO)\nThe city of Wellington, capital of New Zealand, is a member of the 100RC network. It is made up of nine councils. As in Melbourne, this brings some difficulties when coordinating emergency management and disaster risk management activities between multiple organisations.\nWREMO was founded in 2012 as a semiautonomous organisation to coordinate disaster risk management across Wellington's nine councils. WREMO has evolved from a traditional response-focused organisation into a facilitator, helping its local councils and communities determine their own approaches and action plans.\nTo achieve this, WREMO invested heavily in community development and participation, in order to involve partners more closely and to foster innovation. A strong emphasis on end-user perspectives and collaboration from the outset has become central to WREMO's approach.\nInitiatives such as Tsunami Blue Lines, Community Response and Resilience Planning, Community Emergency Preparedness Training, and irreverent use of social media, have helped make the community more connected, and improved the region's capacity to manage disaster risks.\n\u201c The most important thing we have learned over the past four years is that we have a responsibility to understand the needs of our end-users and adapt our operations to suit them, not us. This has forced us to re-examine much of what we thought we knew as emergency management professionals and modify how we think, engage, train and deliver. Because we've become better listeners, our partnerships are stronger than they have ever been and our communities now approach us with exciting ideas that we are able to explore together\u201d.\n- Dan Neely,\nManager of Community Resilience, WREMO.\nBy ensuring activities across all our emergency management agencies have\ncommunity benefit at their core, working across sectors we will foster communities that are better prepared to withstand shocks and bounce back strongly.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nThe future of emergency management in Melbourne and across Victoria will be shaped by global challenges and their local repercussions. As well as climate change\n-\tincluding more frequent and extreme weather events\n-\twe will face changes in population demographics and technology, and greater risk of pandemics and other security threats.\nIn this context, a major task is to ensure that our financial and human investments in emergency service agencies promote community resilience. In other words, these agencies must do more than simply fight fires or respond to other extreme events - they must support community wellbeing, liveability, sustainability and viability.\nThis requires emergency management agencies to collaborate not just across different response agencies, on which notable progress has been made, but with entirely different sectors altogether, as Emergency Management Victoria (EMV) states, \u2018working in conjunction with Communities, Government, Agencies, and Business'.\nPRIMARY\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\nRELATED\nOBJECTIVES\nSTRESSES\nEmpower communities to take active responsibility for their own and each other's wellbeing, safety and health\nAll\n\u2022\tHigh unemployment\n\u2022\tEndemic violence\n\u2022\tDrought\n\u2022\tEnvironmental events\n\u2022\tExtreme heat\n\u2022\tBushfires\n\u2022\tFloods\n\u2022\tEarthquakes\n\u2022\tExtremist acts\nEmergency service agencies have broad and deep relationships with their communities, meaning they are well-placed to foster community resilience. However, traditional notions of \u2018community' in Melbourne are changing, which requires new approaches to engaging people. If our excellent emergency service agencies are to function as community resilience leaders, this will require some cultural change.\nTHE ACTION\nThis action will develop a comprehensive community\nresilience framework for Victoria's emergency\nmanagement sector. This is a key action of the Victorian Emergency Management Strategic Action Plan 2015\u201418,\na three-year rolling plan that outlines the Victorian\nGovernment's plans for creating safer and more resilient communities. The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office and EMV are working together to develop an approach to community resilience that is relevant to communities and the emergency management sector alike, and\nis practical and consistent across local governments\nand their communities, including business and\ncommunity organisations.\nThe framework will be a lens through which sector-wide activities can be viewed, to ensure that that all activities have community benefit at their core. It will help the\nsector ensure that empowering communities and their\nleaders to develop awareness, shared responsibility and\nself-reliance will be part of all emergency management activities, plans, programs and systems.\nEMV will map Victoria's resilience challenges, using\nthe Cities Resilience Framework, and highlight desired\ncommunity outcomes (such as \u2018protection against\nbushfire' or \u2018social connectedness') against each\nemergency service agency's roles and responsibilities.\nThey will also identify which other actors are required\nto achieve the community outcomes. EMV will then\nconsult on these findings, and use the responses to\ndevelop the framework and guidance for use.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION\nSUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\n\u2022 Builds a shared understanding of resilience for the public and the emergency management sector.\n\u2022 Establishes a framework for embedding resilience in planning for emergencies and disasters in metropolitan Melbourne and beyond, improving alignment between agencies, local government and service providers.\n\u2022 Creates increased visibility of the roles of different actors, beyond just emergency management agencies, to achieve EMV's vision of \u2018safer, more resilient communities'.\nParents attending a Bushfire\nPlanning Workshop in Emerald.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nPARTNERS\tNEXT STEPS\nLead: Emergency Management Victoria\n\u2022\tResilient Melbourne Delivery Office\n\u2022\tAll metropolitan councils\n\u2022\tEmergency management agencies\n\u2022\tEmergency Services Leadership Group\n\u2022\tState Crisis and Resilience Council (Risk and Resilience Sub-Committee)\n\u2022\tLocal Government Victoria\nMarch 2016:\n\u2022\tWork began to develop the framework.

For this reason, the Flood Management Strategy - Port Phillip and Westernport was completed in 2015. It sets out how participating organisations will work together over the next five years to understand and better manage flood risks, support flood-emergency preparation and response, and achieve the best social, economic and environmental results.\nThe strategy was produced by Melbourne Water, in collaboration with more than 70 organisations, including local government, and 250 individuals.\nIt sets the following long-term vision:\n\u201c Together we are aware, responsive\nand resilient. Communities, business\nand government understand\nflooding, plan for challenges, and\ntake action to manage risks.\u201d\nMelbourne Water is coordinating governance and implementation of actions in the strategy, with the input and participation of councils and endorsing organisations.\nThis initiative will advance our knowledge of barriers and opportunities for\ncommunity members helping one another. It will be used to inform practical,\ntargeted programs that encourage more cohesive communities, in good times and bad.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nTo equip communities to take active responsibility for\ntheir own and each other's wellbeing, safety and health, we need to better understand what knowledge and resources individuals and communities need.

Programs that provide a solid foundation for cultural integration, as well as offering opportunities for people to learn valuable language and practical skills, are essential for the safety and wellbeing of our communities.\nLife Saving Victoria's multicultural water safety and settlement program teaches water skills to refugees, new arrivals and international students, and helps them settle in to Melbourne. The initiative includes swimming lessons, beach programs, a \u2018meet a lifeguard' program in classrooms, regional open-water learning experiences, and accredited training programs. Perhaps most importantly, it gives participants the chance to establish new social networks, through the recreational, volunteer and employment opportunities it creates.\nThe initiative aims to remove barriers to\nparticipation, such as:\n\u2022\tdistance or lack of transport\n\u2022\tcost of swimming lessons\n\u2022\tlack of facilities and equipment\n\u2022\tcultural and language differences\n\u2022\tlack of \u2018learn to swim' and water safety programs in schools.\nProgram participation is up from 1,956 people in 2006-07 to more than 13,000 people in 2014-15. All participants were reached via one of the 300 partnering multicultural agencies and organisations.\nThere is now an opportunity for local government to work with Life Saving Victoria to extend the benefits in more centres across Melbourne. Other emergency management agencies are also looking at how they can build on the success of this program by incorporating similar culturally inclusive approaches into their activities (e.g. grass fire awareness).\nWe will develop a compendium of Melbourne's leading resilience-building practices, to support community-based resilience efforts.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nCurrently, no single resource exists for understanding,\npromoting and sharing the many efforts that people\nacross Melbourne make to help communities\nadapt, survive and thrive in the face of shocks and\nstresses. In many cases, efforts in different councils\nand communities produce unnecessary duplication.\nTHE ACTION\nMonash University Disaster Resilience Initiative\n(MUDRI) and EMV are developing a community-based resilience compendium, which explores how different communities prepare and strengthen their response to disasters and emergencies.\nWorking with Resilient Melbourne, EMV and MUDRI\nare expanding the scope of the compendium, to take\na broader view of urban resilience, encompassing not\njust shock events but actions and programs tackling\nthe chronic stresses that weaken the fabric of our\nsociety.

The project, to be led by artists, will involve configuring Arts House and North Melbourne Town Hall as a place of community refuge, as a rehearsal in preparedness and building community networks and connections. Evaluation will contribute to policy on the role of artistic and cultural communities in emergency management plans, preparedness, resilience and recovery.\nOver the five years of the project, Refuge will simulate four natural disaster scenarios:\n\u2022 seven days of extreme heat leads to city-wide power outages and reduced access to food and accommodation\n\u2022\ta North Melbourne community hosts a community evacuated from Natimuk in western Victoria\n\u2022\ta North Melbourne community is evacuated and hosted by the Natimuk community\n\u2022\ta North Melbourne community hosts environmental refugees from Tuvalu.\nRefuge is a collaboration between Arts House, the University of Melbourne, the Performing Studies International conference, and a range of organisations involved in emergency management in Victoria.\nThe Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will participate in planned \u2018Refuge' events, share lessons across local government, and explore opportunities for running similar events.\nThe Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will support innovative approaches that make fit-for-purpose insurance affordable to more Melburnians. This means more of our residents will be able to bounce back when unexpected shocks threaten\ntheir livelihoods and prosperity.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nEach year, Australian communities suffer significant losses as a result of natural disasters and other unforeseen events. Personal insurance cover protects the assets of individuals and allows them to return to their former standard of living after such crises.\nHowever, one in five Australian adults does not have general insurance cover for their home, contents or car.82 Generally, this is because they are unable to afford conventional insurance, or the level of cover available is too high for their need. The majority of these people are living on low incomes. For many of them, cars are a lifeline - without a car they might be unable to reach their place of work and might be cut off from essential services and established social networks.\nPRIMARY\tEmpower communities to take\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\tactive responsibility for their own\nand each other's wellbeing, safety and health\nRELATED\tProvide diverse local employment\nOBJECTIVES\nopportunities that support an adaptable workforce, prepared for the jobs of the future\nSTRESSES\t\u2022 Crime\n\u2022\tAccident\nSHOCKS\t\u2022 Bushfire\n\u2022\tFlood\n\u2022\tStorm\nFollowing an accident, theft or major crisis, people facing economic hardship are often unable to repair or replace assets that are essential for their livelihoods or basic needs. Given the increasing regularity and severity of natural disasters in Australia, and the risk of accident or theft, it is important that the assets of vulnerable members of the community are properly insured, to prevent people from slipping into further hardship or financial stress.\nTHE ACTION\nThis first element of this action is based on developing\neducation sessions to encourage people who might\notherwise be considered vulnerable to take out\ninsurance cover, thus increasing their personal\nresilience. It will draw on local government networks\nand communication channels to reach members of the\ncommunity who might not traditionally have insurance. The action will build on \u2018Essentials' by AAI Limited, an innovative insurance scheme that provides basic, affordable and accessible home and contents and car insurance to low-income individuals. Developed by Good Shepherd Microfinance in collaboration with Suncorp, \u2018Essentials' is for people who have a pension or healthcare card, receive regular Centrelink payments, or have an annual household income of less than $48,000. Customers can choose to insure their contents, car, or both, and pay their premium in annual, monthly or fortnightly instalments through Centrepay (Australian Government Department of Human Services).\nSuncorp developed Essentials with a view to driving\nincreased competition and innovation in the insurance\nindustry, particularly around more accessible insurance\nofferings. The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office\nwill build from this platform and work with additional\npartners to establish new forms of insurance at various\nscales, including for small businesses.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION\nSUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\n\u2022 Better insurance cover helps individuals and families recover from natural disasters, crises and bad luck events by enabling them to repair or replace\ncritical assets.\n\u2022 By making personal insurance products available to low-income individuals, it helps people take active responsibility for their wellbeing, safety and health.\n\u2022 It will be a catalyst to competition and innovation in the low-income segment of the insurance market, where only one company currently offers a policy.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nPARTNERS NEXT STEPS\nLead: Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office\n\u2022\tSuncorp (Essentials by AAI)\n\u2022\tGood Shepherd Microfinance\n\u2022\tAll metropolitan councils\nFrom May 2016:\n\u2022\tDevelop education sessions for local government network meetings and\/or community hubs.\n\u2022\tRun pilot education session with two local governments and review outcomes.\n\u2022 Deliver education sessions in other local government areas.\nDuring 2017:\n\u2022 Partner with other insurance providers on different insurance models.\nALIGNED LOCAL ACTION\nIn an effort to improve community resilience and preparedness, Victoria State Emergency Service (VICSES) and Melbourne Water joined forces to create the Flood management Strategy -Port Phillip and Westernport.\nThis strategy demonstrated the importance of involving groups that are often marginalised. VICSES concentrated its efforts on leaders and members of Koori and culturally and linguistically\ndiverse communities, using events created by the community to build understanding and relationships within communities, rather than for them. As well as Koori projects in Maroondah and Darebin areas, relationships have been forged with Jewish, African and Islamic communities. Resources have also been developed to help volunteers communicate with nonEnglish speaking people during emergency incidents.\nALIGNED LOCAL ACTION\nIBM Smarter Cities Challenge and Twitter data\nMelbourne is ever more complex and we need to be able to communicate with our citizens in the most effective ways, particularly in times of severe disruption. At the moment, different organisations use different channels, depending on the situation. Further, citizens are selforganising and using social media to inform one another when unexpected events occur.\nAs part of the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge, Melbourne is drawing on the expertise of senior IBM personnel to consider how we can make better use of technology to improve the resilience and safety of our citizens across our metropolitan region. IBM will also consider how social media information created by people in real time can help authorities respond to an unexpected event.\nThe City of Melbourne is one of three Smarter Cities selected in the 2015-16 cycle to receive an additional grant from Twitter. Twitter will provide access to both current and historic data relating to Melbourne, which can enable time-lapsed geographic mapping of the movement patterns of city residents, analysis of citizens' sentiments towards existing or proposed policies and programs, and heat-mapping of food-borne illnesses and other infectious diseases. Insights gleaned from this data will be incorporated into IBM's recommendations.\nTHRIVE\n\u2018Thrive' actions aim to significantly improve quality of life.\nAccess to employment, open space, transport and services - including digital technologies and social media - has a powerful influence on quality of life. Helping Melburnians thrive means increasing\nALIGNED LOCAL ACTION\nVicHealth Mental Wellbeing Strategy\nThe VicHealth Mental Wellbeing Strategy\n2015\u20142019 is part of VicHealth's campaign to improve the health and wellbeing of one million Victorians by 2023.83\nThis strategy is informed by the CSIRO and VicHealth's Bright Futures report, which states that focusing on people 12-25 years old was important part of improving mental wellbeing in the community.84 The report notes the importance of educating and preparing people in this age group to be resilient and adaptable in a world characterised by decreasing job security, the fluidity of globalisation\ncommunity inclusion and participation, opening up new opportunities, and seeking new ways to improve health and wellbeing, including mental health.\nand technology, increasingly diverse societies and increasing exposure to the internet. These matters are all addressed to some degree in Resilient Melbourne. They are important to local government, which will work with VicHealth as appropriate.\nThe capacity to be autonomous, regulate one's emotions, have self-confidence and empathy, and solve problems, are critical resilience abilities for our entire community. A priority of VicHealth's Mental Wellbeing Strategy 2015-2019 is building these qualities in young people, so that they are integrated and self-perpetuating for decades to come.\nMelbourne's metropolitan councils will collaborate with citizens and Victoria's main transport bodies to establish a metropolitan bicycle path network, to help make cycling a safer and more practical alternative to car travel.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nAlthough Melbourne has an extensive network of public transport, the 2011 census found that 60.6 per cent of Melburnians drive a car to work.85 When coupled with a rapidly growing population, this heavy reliance on private vehicle travel is leading to increasing congestion on our roads. An Infrastructure Australia report recently predicted that the annual cost of congestion and delays on Melbourne's road network will triple to $9 billion by 2031. It also forecast that demand on Melbourne's public transport network will grow by 89 per cent in the next 15 years.86\nThe mode and duration of commuting have been linked to health problems - for example, lengthy commutes contribute to higher stress levels, shorter sleeping times, and generally lower self-reported health. In inner Melbourne suburbs, where several transport types are available, 70 per cent of residents receive sufficient regular exercise and only 14 per cent are considered obese. By contrast, in Melbourne's more car-dependent west, some 30 per cent (around 146,000 adults) are obese - the sixth-highest level of obesity and physical inactivity in Victoria.87\nAn important characteristic of a resilient city is flexibility - having a number of alternative ways to provide services and respond to changing circumstances. Similarly, resilient cities have redundancy built into their systems - this means intentionally having spare capacity, so that systems can continue to function should they experience an unexpected disruption.\nFor mobility, this means giving people the ability to choose between multiple, effective modes of transport.\nhazardous routes.\nPRIMARY\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\nRedundancy and choice are also important in extreme events. For example, in the face of Super Storm Sandy, many New Yorkers used bicycles to make their way home from the city centre when buses, subway and overland trains could not operate.\nCycling is already very popular in Melbourne, with the Australian Bicycle Council estimating that 877,000 Victorians ride a bicycle in a typical week.88 With 40 per cent of all car trips in Melbourne being less than two kilometres, cycling is a good alternative in many cases.89 However, Melbourne's disjointed network of bicycle paths discourages cycling in many areas, as missing links force cyclists to take less direct and more\nCreate and sustain buildings, infrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity, and health\nEmpower communities to take active responsibility for their own and each other's wellbeing, safety and health\nEnable strong natural assets and ecosystems alongside a growing population\n\u2022\tHigher rates of chronic illnesses\n\u2022\tTraffic congestion\n\u2022\tTransport infrastructure emergency\nRELATED\nOBJECTIVES\nSTRESSES\nSHOCKS\nTHE ACTION\nThe Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will work with councils across Melbourne to coordinate a metropolitan proposal for establishing cycle paths and corridors that is both holistic in scope and tailored to local needs.\nThis work will link closely with the Victorian Cycling Strategy, which is currently being updated and will then be implemented by Active Transport Victoria, a unit in the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR).\nThis planning and coordination initiative furthers the objectives of the Victorian Government, specifically the Active Transport and cycling commitments outlined in Plan Melbourne, by:\n\u2022\tpooling knowledge from researchers, government and infrastructure agencies and cycling advocacy groups\n\u2022\tdrawing on local government and infrastructure agency expertise to plan the metropolitan bicycle path network and connect existing bicycle paths, building on existing initiatives such as the Northern Trails initiative\n\u2022\tencouraging local government and infrastructure agencies to build new bicycle paths.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\nProviding safer and more practical cycling routes across Melbourne will:\n\u2022\tincrease people's transport choices, building additional redundancy into the transport network\n\u2022\tmake the community more connected, with greater opportunities for social interaction\n\u2022\tencourage individuals to improve their health and wellbeing\n\u2022\treduce the use of cars for short journeys, reducing congestion and lowering emissions\n\u2022\tmake government transport spending more efficient, through improved planning, prioritisation and coordination.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nPARTNERS NEXT STEPS\nLead: Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office\n\u2022 All metropolitan councils\n\u2022 Active Transport Victoria (to start operations on 1 July 2016) \u2022 Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning \u2022 Melbourne Water\n\u2022 Metropolitan Planning Authority (MPA)\n\u2022 Parks Victoria\n\u2022 VicRoads\n\u2022 VicTrack\n\u2022 The Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources is currently analysing information collected from the updated Victorian Cycling Strategy community consultation sessions held in late 2015.\n\u2022 Resilient Melbourne will work with the organisations above to present a collective metropolitan government view and implementation ideas.\n\u2022 The updated Victorian Cycling Strategy will be published in 2016.\nProperty companies will trial new ways of putting residents at the heart of neighbourhood and local infrastructure planning and operations.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nThe built form of our cities and neighbourhoods\nstrongly influences the type and quality of community connections and interactions. Although the rapid pace and large scale of development across Melbourne can act as barriers to consultation, meaningfully involving people in making decisions about their built and\nnatural environment can foster stronger community\nidentity and make places more desirable, in new and\nestablished areas.\nPRIMARY RESILIENCE OBJECTIVE\tCreate and sustain buildings, infrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity, and health\nRELATED OBJECTIVES\tEmpower communities to take active responsibility for their own and each other's wellbeing, safety and health\nSTRESSES\t\u2022 Lower rates of community participation \u2022 Decreasing social equality \u2022 Development pressures on ecosystem services\nSHOCKS\tAll - cohesive communities pull together and support one another in times of shock\nTHE ACTION\nThe community-led neighbourhood renewal and development pilot projects will support citizen participation in neighbourhood and local infrastructure planning. In its first round, this will involve partnerships with up to five property companies. The project will include a range of development types, from multi-unit buildings to redevelopments of entire precincts, located in inner, middle and outer Melbourne municipalities. We anticipate that some of the developments will be entirely new, while others will be scheduled or already established, with developers willing to try new ways of putting residents at the heart of decision making.\nProperty companies and their partners will:\n\u2022\ttest a range of tools and frameworks, both existing (such as Green Star Communities, Ecodistricts) and new, to collaborate and share in decision making\n\u2022\tmeasure results and report on their findings, working in conjunction with academic and other partners\n\u2022\tcontribute to a body of publicly available guidance on participatory planning across Melbourne.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\n\u2022\tParticipating communities will be better able to influence and shape their neighbourhoods to meet their specific needs and interests.

Congestion may also reflect people being forced to live further from their work owing to housing and other costs, weak local economies, and public transport options being impractical or simply less convenient than car travel.\nCongestion increases the costs and reduces the efficiency of business and households. Infrastructure Australia estimates the annual economic cost of Melbourne's congestion at over $2 billion.90 Too often we look at the solution to congestion as one requiring significant investment in yet more infrastructure, ignoring the deep well of innovation that exists within the public at large and innovative businesses that may offer solutions frequently not considered by policy makers.\nPRIMARY\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\nRELATED\nOBJECTIVES\nSTRESSES\nSHOCKS\nCreate and sustain buildings, infrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity and health\nProvide diverse local employment opportunities that support an adaptable workforce, prepared for the jobs of the future\n\u2022\tLower rates of community participation\n\u2022\tUnemployment, particularly among young people\n\u2022\tTraffic congestion\n\u2022\tTransport infrastructure emergency\nTravel can lead to social interaction, but in congestion these interactions are less likely to be enlivening or uplifting. If people can be encouraged to get out of their cars, or to make better use of car transport, there may be opportunities to reduce the stress of congestion and to improve connections between neighbours and communities more broadly.\nTHE ACTION\nCitymart, which is described in more detail below, will crowd-source potential solutions from around the world to achieve two important goals simultaneously: reducing congestion while promoting increased positive social interactions.\nCitizens and entrepreneurs, locally and globally,\nwill be encouraged to propose solutions to reducing\nMelbourne's congestion. This will provide decision\nmakers with access to a vast knowledge resource -citizens and entrepreneurs - to find innovative solutions to this increasingly pressing problem. An internationally recognised expert panel will assess ideas and identify a winning solution for implementation.\nInitially, citizens and entrepreneurs will be asked four simple questions:\n\u2022\tWhat is your idea for solving congestion in Melbourne?\n\u2022\tHow will it help people to interact better?\n\u2022\tHow ready is your solution?\n\u2022\tHow can we measure its success?\nTHE 100RC GLOBAL NETWORK IN ACTION\nCitymart is currently working on related problems in the 100RC cities of Bristol, Da Nang and Oakland.

Citymart will help a city define its problem statement and run an open challenge process to source the best available solutions to meet their needs from global solution\nproviders. The open nature of Citymart Challenges has provided direct economic benefit by increasing and broadening competition among providers, and inspiring new approaches to achieve a city's objectives.\nCitymart Challenges can be applied to procurement or pilot projects and will help a city gain valuable market intelligence to source the best available market solutions to implement their resilience strategies.\nALIGNED LOCAL ACTION\nMelbourne Metro Rail Project\nWhile Resilient Melbourne supports diversifying local economies across Melbourne, our resilience as a metropolitan area also depends on a strong, accessible, central city.\nCurrently, Melbourne's 15 radial suburban train lines feed into Melbourne's central business district via the City Loop tunnel. This creates a major bottleneck in our public transport network and prevents us from increasing network capacity to serve our rapidly growing population.\nIn 2015, the Victorian Government announced the construction of a 9 kilometre rail tunnel from Kensington in the city's north, to South Yarra, via the central city. The Melbourne Metro Rail Project will also deliver five new stations and cost approximately $10.9 billion, with works to begin in 2017.\nMelbourne Metro will reduce the rail network's vulnerability to failure by providing entirely separate end-to-end lines from Sunbury in the west to Cranbourne-Pakenham in the south-east. Additionally, 39,000 more passengers will be able to reach and leave the central city during the morning and afternoon travel peaks.\nGreater capacity on the public transport network will reduce congestion across all modes of transport. The project will be equivalent to removing 18,000 cars from the city's roads during the busiest hours of the day, and will provide public transport users with an alternative to taking trams along Swanston Street, currently the city's busiest tram and pedestrian corridor.\nYoung people will be helped to design, create and test out their own technology-based strategies to tackle stresses and shocks affecting youth mental health.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nAustralia's performance on international innovation\nindicators is one of the lowest among OECD\ncountries.91 From a mental health perspective, we have a limited understanding of the relationship between risk and resilience, and we often don't translate new evidence about resilience and vulnerability into policy and practices. Involving young people in making\ndecisions is essential if we are to improve in this respect.\nPRIMARY\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\nRELATED\nOBJECTIVES\nIn Australia, 14 per cent of children aged 4-12 years have mental health problems, rising to 19 per cent among adolescents (13-17 years) and 27 per cent for young adults (18-24 years).92 Twenty per cent of young people aged 12 to 25 had personally experienced a mental health, alcohol or other substance use problem in the last five years.93\nSHOCKS\nEmpower communities to take active responsibility for their own and each other's wellbeing, safety and health\nProvide diverse local employment opportunities that support an adaptable workforce, prepared for the jobs of the future\nCreate and sustain buildings, infrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity and health\n\u2022\tUnemployment, particularly among young people\n\u2022\tFamily violence\n\u2022\tAlcohol and drug abuse\n\u2022\tIncreasing pressure on healthcare services\n\u2022\tLower rates of community participation\n\u2022\tNumerous at the level of individuals and cohorts of young people\nTHE ACTION\nBuilding on work conducted with the University of Western Sydney as part of the Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres Program (CRC), the Young and Well CRC will develop up to five living laboratories across metropolitan Melbourne, one in each of Melbourne's sub-regions. The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will coordinate between potential partners to develop the living labs. The Young and Resilient living labs will bring together young people, researchers, policy makers, employers, health practitioners, parents and technology providers to investigate, design, create and test innovative technology-based strategies that equip young people to tackle personal problems and promote individual, community and social wellbeing. The laboratories will:\n\u2022\tdevelop and test strategies for minimising harm and supporting the resilience of young people and their communities\n\u2022\tresearch the role of technologies in the lives of young people\n\u2022\tfoster processes for generating new software, apps, initiatives and enterprises that help young people build the skills and access the services that will equip them to improve their personal wellbeing and resilience\n\u2022\tbe a catalyst for community-based initiatives to support the resilience of young people.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?

The process began with a community convention, held in late April 2016, to share what is already working well, identify what is still needed, and start finding solutions together.\nFor more information on these initiatives, see\nhttp:\/\/whwest.org.au\/health-promotion\/prevent-\nviolence\/preventing-violence-together\/ and http:\/\/\ntogetherwecan.org.au\/about-us\/.\nYoung people who might otherwise never be exposed to people in senior\nprofessional roles will meet leading and inspirational Melbourne based and international science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals, and learn about how they got to their current positions.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nAustralian students are faced with a growing number of career and education choices, but not all are equipped to make fully informed decisions. We need to help students make smart choices about their futures, and we must communicate the advantages and value of careers in STEM, in a way that is inclusive and actively reaches out to disadvantaged and isolated students.\nThis is particularly important in Melbourne: our economy is rapidly shifting from its traditional manufacturing base. Meanwhile, we have high rates of immigration, meaning that many people do not have established networks that open up employment opportunities, while long-time residents may have very strong networks that can be hard for new arrivals to penetrate.\nPRIMARY\tProvide diverse local employment\nRESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVE\topportunities that support an\nadaptable workforce prepared for the jobs of the future\nRELATED\tCreate and sustain buildings,\nOBJECTIVES\ninfrastructure and activities that promote social cohesion, equality of opportunity and health\nSTRESSES \u2022 Decreasing social equality\n\u2022\tLower rates of community participation\n\u2022\tUnemployment, particularly among young people\nSHOCKS\t\u2022 Global economic crisis\nor downturn\nTHE ACTION\nLifeJourney is a social-purpose driven business that lets students test-drive future STEM careers and learn from top industry professionals through a free, interactive, online platform which in Australia is known as The Day of STEM. It links students with mentors in a secure online environment, allowing students to get a real-life appreciation of what happens in the professional world and how these executives got to where they are today. It also provides an opportunity to learn about STEM careers, develop new skills, and to understand industry challenges facing Australia now and in the future. The goal is to help students find their own passion and identify career paths that they may not otherwise have known to be available to them.\nLifeJourney's technology enables a single mentor to inspire and guide 10,000 or more students at the same time and has an ambitious target of reaching 2.5 million students across Australia, with potentially up to 1 million in Melbourne alone.\nThe Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office is working with LifeJourney to tailor the Day of STEM service so that local government and other partners can help the service to reach our young people who are least likely to get this guidance from any other source.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\nThe action will:\n\u2022\tprovide inclusive opportunities for a broad range of students to learn about STEM careers\n\u2022\tpromote mathematical and scientific literacy across Melbourne's population\n\u2022\tfoster a job market that is equipped with the skillsets that match the needs of the economy.\nA tunnel boring machine creates a 1.2km tunnel for the Melbourne Main Sewer Replacement Project.\nThe Day of STEM platform works with top\nSTEM-related professionals from major Australian\norganisations to inspire students to identify and then\npursue their dreams, providing them with an educational\nroadmap as they begin their own career journeys.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nPARTNERS\tNEXT STEPS\nLead: LifeJourney\n\u2022\tResilient Melbourne Delivery Office\n\u2022\tAll metropolitan councils\n\u2022\tRegional development agencies\n\u2022\tTechnical and further education colleges\n\u2022\tThe first Australian organisations to sign up to provide mentors include Telstra, Optus, Westpac, AMP, Twitter, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Deloitte, CISCO, Collingwood Football Club and SAS.

It provides expert advice to government, undertakes research and prepares a 30-year infrastructure strategy for Victoria.\nWork on the 30-year strategy, which will outline short-, medium- and long-term infrastructure priorities, is now under way. The strategy will cover energy, water and waste, transport, education and training, health and human services, justice, culture, civics, science and agriculture, and information and communications technologies (ICT). Consultation will occur throughout 2016, with the final strategy to be published by the end of the year.\nOne of the 30 draft objectives is \u2018build resilience to shocks', as unexpected events are likely to disrupt Victoria's society, environment and economy over the coming decades. These shocks could be anything from natural disasters, pandemics, ICT disruptions, global economic crises and terrorism, to relatively minor but more frequent disruptions to transport networks.\nVictoria's vulnerability to these shocks will partly be determined by the resilience and adaptability of its infrastructure. Infrastructure Victoria's 30-year strategy aims to ensure that Victoria's infrastructure is able to adapt and respond positively to unexpected events.\nInfrastructure Victoria is working with the Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office to best align our respective efforts.\nEMBED\nIn a resilient Melbourne resilience thinking, planning and actions will be core to our institutions and ways of working.\nTo achieve our objectives and enable our communities to adapt, thrive and survive, our various levels of government and our organisations must ensure that their policies and practices actively increase our collective resilience. They need to understand how they can actively improve community resilience, through their own decisions, the cultures they foster and how they cooperate. Existing and emerging organisations need to consider resilience consequences in all they do and be prepared to manage\nthe shocks and stresses that may directly impact them in order to contribute to the resilience of our city as a whole.\nAnd we need to track our progress. Identifying successes and learning from mistakes will help us communicate honestly and clearly with our communities, supporting them in their own efforts.\nStatement of support from Michael Berkowitz,\nChief Executive Officer and President of 100 Resilient Cities\nWe at 100 Resilient Cities commend Melbourne for the way it is taking on the challenge of working at a metropolitan scale, working with existing structures and governance models in new ways to deliver resilience dividends for its communities.\nNumerous 100RC cities work in similar metropolitan arrangements so learning how to address resilience issues at this scale is critical. Additionally, cities are increasingly globally interconnected, so learning alongside Melbourne about collaboration at a local scale will help us to better collaborate globally.\nThe idea of a temporary Office to embed resilience into existing institutions and organisations is novel. Conceptually it makes sense. Most importantly, if it is right in Melbourne's local context, that should be the greatest determinant of success and we will look for what lessons others may draw from this.\nWe believe that the initial 100RC Platform Partners with whom you are working, including CSIRO,\nThe Nature Conservancy, Trimble and Citymart, will provide an incredible starting point for implementing this strategy. The ability of the Office to draw from these and other platform partners as you go forward will add notable weight to the resources able to be shared across Melbourne.\nWe wish you well in your efforts - now the hard work really begins as you move from strategy making to true resilience-building. We are committed to working with you as you take this next step. We hope that as a collective of 32 local government areas working together and across sectors you live up to your aspiration of being a city that others look to for advice and support on resiliencebuilding. We look forward to being with you and being part of that great knowledge sharing.\u201d\nLEARNING FROM OTHERS - BARCELONA\nIn 2007 the City of Barcelona was grappling with a mix of infrastructure and environmental difficulties that may be familiar to Melburnians. The city was in the midst of Spain's worst drought in 40 years,\nleading to stringent water restrictions, construction of desalination plants and serious consequences for water-dependent businesses. Around the same time, it experienced a major electricity outage that left more than 350,000 households and businesses without power for more than 56 hours.\nIn response, the City of Barcelona developed the\n3S (Security of Services Supply) project, which\nbrought together infrastructure owners, operators\nand government agencies to better understand\nvulnerabilities and interconnections between\ndifferent elements of the urban infrastructure.\nThe assessments identified that the city's\ninfrastructure management systems were not well\nintegrated and did not have extra capacity that could be drawn upon should basic systems fail.\nThese findings were acted upon by multi-stakeholder working groups called Urban Resilience Boards, which have identified and managed more than 40 projects to better prepare Barcelona for future shock events. Projects included setting up a \u2018situation room' that coordinates information critical to the day-to-day functioning of the city, and undertaking a comprehensive audit of Barcelona's network of tunnels. Following the success of the projects, the city created the Department of Urban Resilience to coordinate resilience-related efforts and\ncollaborate with international institutions to\nshare ideas and experiences.\nEstablish an office to oversee implementation of Resilient Melbourne; develop a range of capacities in metropolitan local government; and embed resilience\nprinciples and actions more broadly across metropolitan Melbourne and\nrelevant institutions.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nResilient Melbourne has been developed through collaboration across sectors, led by local government. If we are to realise its full potential, this collaboration will need to continue and grow, drawing in more organisations, communities and individuals. The launch of this strategy is just the starting point.\nIn the short term, resources are needed to put in place the actions proposed in this strategy. To make sure that the resilience vision for Melbourne's communities lives beyond this first strategy, further resources and ongoing leadership are needed, to build on the partnerships and networks already established through Resilient Melbourne\n\u201c There is a unique opportunity to link the resilience of our communities to the council planning processes, as well as council budgets currently under development. There may be existing allocations for actions and specific programs, and in some cases, councils may be undertaking existing actions and programs that can be built upon.\u201d\nStephen Wall,\nCEO\nMaribyrnong City Council\nTHE ACTION\nThe temporary Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office (the Office) is being established for a five year period to provide sufficient time to deliver on the commitments made in this strategy and to determine the appropriate organisations to achieve resilience outcomes for many years to come.\nThe Office has been created to unite the efforts made by numerous organisations and individuals over the past 18 months. It will oversee the implementation of this strategy, supported in particular by the 32 councils of Melbourne; Emergency Management Victoria; the Municipal Association of Victoria; the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning; and the Department of Premier and Cabinet.\nThe Office will help ensure that the actions described in Resilient Melbourne are implemented successfully, and maintain the involvement of Melbourne councils and other partners. It will oversee the establishment of a governance structure for each action, refinement of the actions, development of new actions, and monitoring and reporting on progress of the actions. Additionally, the Office will work with local government and its relevant associations to embed resilience-building actions in council plans and processes.\nThe Office will ensure the delivery of the next strategy and determine the appropriate organisations and institutions to do this work beyond the five years of the Office's operation. Linked to this, it will advocate for resilience principles to be built into relevant policies and actions. For example, Resilient Melbourne coordinated a submission from local government CEOs to the current review of Victoria's Local Government Act 1989. This is a major opportunity for Melbourne's 32 councils to formally integrate resilience principles into the way they do business, by making resilience-building activities an explicit objective in the revised Act.\nThe Office will manage the generation, holding and dispersal of funds from private sector and philanthropic partners, and the pro-bono contributions of services from 100RC Platform Partners, to create a lasting, multi-sectoral approach to preparing Melbourne for the future and its emerging challenges. It will also establish close links with the City of Melbourne professorial chair in resilient cities (p. 148) and be a bridge between local partners and 100RC, for sharing knowledge and resources.\nThrough these activities, the Office will support Melbourne's resilience and contribute to national and international resilience-building.\nReporting on Melbourne's resilience eff orts\nProviding feedback to our communities and institutions on Melbourne's current resilience, and on the results of resilience-building projects that have been implemented, will be critical in maintaining support for this strategy, and bringing about change. The Office will report on the state of city resilience as well as on effectiveness of each individual action proposed in Resilient Melbourne.\nThe Delivery Office will inform through a range of channels, including annual report processes. The Office will continue to improve its website to become a substantial resource of resilience information for Melbourne, drawing from local actions, as well as from the 100RC network.\nMonitoring\nWhile developing Resilient Melbourne, we established a Resilience Indicators Community of Practice. Bringing together organisations with roles central to understanding Melbourne's resilience, it will agree measures of Melbourne's resilience, gather relevant data, improve its accessibility and quality.\nOrganisations participating in the Resilience Indicators Community of Practice include the Community Resilience Unit of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, VicHealth, the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network, Community Indicators Victoria, several universities, and other organisations already funding resilience-related research, such as the Scanlon Foundation's work on social cohesion.95\nMelbourne's 32 councils are already crucial to these efforts, as they research and analyse demographic, economic, environmental and property information to plan for and support their services, community programs and capital projects.\nIn addition to such sources, we intend to apply the City Resilience Index, based on the City Resilience Framework developed by the Rockefeller Foundation and 100RC. This will enable us to monitor our resilience in line with other cities globally, enabling further collaboration.\nEvaluation and review\nBefore we implement an action, we will agree performance measures. Evaluating how actions work in practice will be essential to building resilience. Little in Resilient Melbourne has a guaranteed result. Indeed, a great part of the value of this work is a willingness to experiment, to try out new ways of working together. Evaluating actions, changing them if necessary, and being open about what has and has not worked, will be a significant benefit of Resilient Melbourne, both locally and across the 100RC network.\nTo assess its own effectiveness, the Office will use the LBG international methodology for measuring community impact (http:\/\/www.lbg-online.net\/). This will help us understand what resources the Office has attracted to our collective efforts, how those resources have been used, and what has been achieved.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\n\u2022\tThe Office will be a central point for attracting\nthe resources needed to embed resilience principles\nand actions across Melbourne, its institutions, organisations and systems.\n\u2022\tA temporary (five-year) structure will allow us to realise benefits and build on the investment made\nto date, while remaining true to our guiding principles of building on existing structures, reducing duplication, and delivering tangible benefits to Melbourne's diverse communities.\n\u2022\tMonitoring will ensure that we understand what does and does not work in improving resilience.\n\u2022\tReporting publicly will maintain the credibility\nof this work and help us communicate the facts to more diverse parties.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nPARTNERS\tNEXT STEPS\nLead: Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office\n\u2022\tAll metropolitan councils\n\u2022\tEmergency Management Victoria\n\u2022\tLocal Government Victoria\n\u2022\tMunicipal Association of Victoria\n\u2022\tDepartment of Premier and Cabinet\n\u2022\tCorporate and philanthropic partners\nInitial funding has been secured, to ensure immediate running of the Office, which will be officially launched in mid-2016. This will enable us to build on our early work, ensuring a seamless transition from strategy development to implementation.\n\u2022 The Resilient Melbourne Steering Committee has been refreshed to reflect broader metropolitan input. It will ensure we continue to seek the greatest possible opportunities at a metropolitan scale, relevant to local communities within individual councils.\n\u2022 We are seeking additional funding and new partnerships, to make sure that the temporary Office will operate effectively over its five-year existence.\nBy late 2017:\n\u2022 First update report published\nBy July 2021:\n\u2022 The Office will complete its mission.\nEstablish a professorial position to lead and coordinate academic work on practical resilience-building actions in Melbourne.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nA wide range of activities has already contributed to\nMelbourne's current level of urban resilience. At the\nsame time, research conducted over the past 18 months through 100RC and others has led to new ways of thinking on the subject. Melbourne's strong academic institutions can help make our city a prominent\ncontributor to emerging international urban resilience\npractices. To understand how to apply urban resilience\nacross the city, Melbourne's academic bodies need to be part of international resilience research and involved in its local implementation.\nTHE ACTION\nThe professorial chair in resilient cities is being\nestablished at the University of Melbourne, in\npartnership with the City of Melbourne. This chair\nwill coordinate academic work in the field of resilience\nbetween the university, the City of Melbourne and\na range of external parties, including universities\nacross Melbourne.\nThe chair will work with all of the University of\nMelbourne's faculties and interests, and will play a key\nrole in influencing and stimulating local and international public debate and policy in urban resilience. The incumbent will also support the efforts of the Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office and will help build knowledge and embed resilience into academic research projects and other activities. This will likely include being an important contributor to the Resilience Indicators Community of Practice (p. 145).\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\n\u2022\tfosters the work of Resilient Melbourne and makes it an integral part of the work of our universities, helping us meet our long-term objectives.\n\u2022\tprovides a central coordinating point for research into resilience.\n\u2022\tstrengthens Melbourne's academic credentials in resilience, while contributing to this rapidly expanding field of practice and research.\n\u2022\tsupports Melbourne's leadership as a resilient and desirable place to live.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nPARTNERS NEXT STEPS\nLeads: University of Melbourne and City of Melbourne\n\u2022\tParticipating metropolitan councils\n\u2022\tMajor universities in Melbourne and overseas\n2016:\n\u2022\tThe professorial chair in urban resilience commences initial five-year appointment.\n\u2022\tProfessorial chair and Chief Resilience Officer to determine shared research agenda.\n\u2022\tProfessorial chair identifies opportunities for partnerships and grants - continuing research presents longer opportunities and timeframes.\nALIGNED LOCAL ACTION\nWorking to embed resilience and build social cohesion\nIn May 2015, the Hon. Daniel Andrews MP,\nPremier of Victoria, announced the establishment of the Social Cohesion and Community Resilience Taskforce. Its aim is to facilitate collective action across governments, community and academia to strengthen social cohesion and community resilience, and prevent violent extremism. The Community Resilience Unit in the Department of Premier and Cabinet was established to support the Taskforce.\nThe Taskforce recognised that the issues are complex, difficult to understand and interconnected, and that steps taken by governments alone will not succeed. Thus the Strategic Framework to Strengthen Victoria's Social Cohesion and the\nResilience of its Communities was developed, in partnership with communities, academics, service providers, philanthropic foundations, businesses and other interested parties.96\nThis document identifies ways for governments, communities, families and young people to work together on projects that promote social inclusion. The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office and metropolitan councils will continue working closely with the Community Resilience Unit to strengthen Melbourne's social cohesion. The Taskforce has been funded for four years.\nIncorporate resilience principles into all levels of the local government sector, through a new training program aimed at officer-level staff and above.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nThe Commonwealth and Victorian governments, as well as local governments, all develop policies and actions that have major implications for the ability of Melbourne and its communities to withstand, respond to, and thrive in the face of shocks and stresses. Local government is increasingly responsible for implementing such policies, often with limited resources, particularly in the area of emergency management and in dealing with the unintended consequences of policy and funding changes.\nTHE ACTION\nA resilience training program is being developed for local government employees across metropolitan Melbourne. It is based on leading global practice in urban resilience and will equip council officers with the knowledge and resources to incorporate resilience principles into their day-to-day decision making, processes and cultures.\nAlthough the training must cover much more than emergency management, it will reflect the findings of Local Government Victoria's current review of local government's capability and capacity in managing emergencies. We will also work with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on a project to help those 1,400 Victorian organisations that deliver services for DHHS in emergency situations (which include local councils) to be better prepared and more resilient.\nBENEFITS - HOW DOES THE ACTION SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?\n\u2022\tIncorporating urban resilience principles into local government cultures will lead to more robust, longterm, inclusive policies and implementation plans.\n\u2022\tGreater cooperation will lead to more efficient and effective services.\n\u2022\tOfficers in all councils will better understand resilience thinking and will learn practical ways to incorporate resilience planning into council actions.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nLead: Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office\n\u2022\tLG Pro\n\u2022\tLocal Government Victoria\n\u2022\tMunicipal Association of Australia\n\u2022\tVictorian Local Government Association\n\u2022\tEmergency Management Victoria\n\u2022\tDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\u2022\tLocal government employees Mid-2016:\n\u2022\tDesign of the program begins.\nFollowing November 2016 local government elections:\n\u2022\tResilient Melbourne Delivery Office provides support for councillor briefings.\nBy December 2016:\n\u2022\tProgram design is completed.\nFebruary 2017:\n\u2022\tFirst full training session runs - sessions continue on an ongoing basis.\nWhat comes next?\nThank you for your interest in Resilient Melbourne.\nIt is one step in an on-going approach that builds on the tremendous efforts and achievements of many people, over a long time, to make Melbourne a successful, inclusive and modern city.\nThe actions in Resilient Melbourne test out new ways of\nworking. By monitoring their results on several levels, we will not only learn what works well and what could be improved for specific actions, but also how different\nactions may combine to produce greater, and sometimes\nunexpected, benefits.\nBy drawing on our shared experiences, and learning from these and future actions, together we will foster a resilient Melbourne, a city that is viable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous, long into the future.\nPlease be part of the effort. Identify actions you would like to be involved in or let us know of actions that you think are already contributing to our objectives. We\nare constantly looking for new partners, new ways of working and new ways to finance and resource actions. Visit: www.resilientmelbourne.com.au\nEmail: resilience@melbourne.vic.gov.au\nQuestions and answers -\nwith Chief Resilience Officer, Toby Kent\nOver the last 18 months I have had the privilege of meeting with hundreds of\nleading actors across government, academic, business, infrastructure, emergency management, environment, community and health sectors. With the support of the Resilient Melbourne team, we have fielded a range of questions about the Resilient Melbourne initiative and resilience thinking more generally. Below\nare some of the most frequently asked questions. The Glossary on page 163 also\ncontains some useful definitions.\nWhat is resilience?\nThis project uses the 100RC definition of urban\nresilience: the capacity of individuals, institutions,\nbusinesses and systems within a city to adapt, survive\nand thrive no matter what kind of chronic stresses and\nacute shocks they experience.\nWhat are shocks and stresses?\nShocks are sudden, often unexpected, events that\nthreaten a city. Examples include bushfires, floods\nand heatwaves. Stresses are longer-term problems\nthat weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or\ncyclical basis. Examples include sea-level rise, increasing pressures on healthcare services, unemployment, stretched public transport systems, and high levels of family violence.\nIs resilience the same as sustainability?\nWhat about liveability?\nResilience in Melbourne's context incorporates\nelements of sustainability and liveability.\nSustainability means balancing economic, social and\nenvironmental factors. It is concerned with how we can manage resources to ensure future generations have the same opportunities that we enjoy today.\nLiveability is the sum of many elements that contribute to quality of life. These include the built and natural environments, economic prosperity, social stability, and access to educational, cultural, entertainment and recreational opportunities.\nAlthough successful cities are sustainable and liveable,\nthey may still be vulnerable to shocks and stresses.\nCities must evolve and adapt in response to changing\ncircumstances, such as population growth, a volatile\nglobal economy and climate change. Without this\nadaptability, accumulating stresses or sudden shocks can put liveable and sustainable cities at risk, resulting in social breakdown, physical collapse or economic deprivation.\nWhy is being \u2018viable' part of the vision?\nSurely Melbourne is already viable?\nMelbourne today is undoubtedly a viable city. However, the nature of resilience thinking means we cannot simply take our current situation for granted. If\nMelbourne is to remain viable and liveable in the long\nterm, we need to acknowledge our own vulnerabilities\nand work hard to overcome them. To achieve a truly\ndesirable future we should be prepared to consider\nthe undesirable, including what it would look like were\ncommunities or the city as a whole to be \u2018unviable'.\nWe must equip ourselves, building on our strong\nfoundations, so that when disruptions happen, our\ncommunities and systems can cope and recover,\ncollectively and as individuals.\nWho prepared this strategy?\nResilient Melbourne is a true collaboration across levels of government, business and community. This document was drafted by the Resilient Melbourne Project Team (based at City of Melbourne), with the assistance of our strategy partner AECOM, and supported by 100RC. Senior leaders and staff from metropolitan Melbourne's councils were key contributors and reviewers of\nthe strategy.\nFor more detail on the strategy development\nprocess, see pages 14-15. For the members of the\nResilience Project Team, Resilient Melbourne Steering Committee, and Strategy Review Panel, see page 158.\nHow does this fi t with other strategies like\nPlan Melbourne and the State Water Plan?\nResilient Melbourne aims to incorporate resilience\nthinking into all that we do, as well as build on existing\nresilience-building efforts. Therefore, links to existing\ndocuments such as Plan Melbourne and the State\nWater Plan are crucial.\nFor example, Resilient Melbourne has been developed\nwith the involvement of the Community Resilience\nUnit of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, which recently released the Strategic Framework to Strengthen Victoria's Social Cohesion and the Resilience of its\nCommunities. This close association will continue as we\nimplement Resilient Melbourne.\nIs this just a strategy for local government?\nNo. Although Melbourne's councils are essential to the resilience of Melbourne's diverse communities, many of the problems that our city faces are too complex and\ninterconnected for local governments to address on their own. Everything in Resilient Melbourne is relevant to local government, but responsibility for implementing its proposals needs to be shared.\nResilient Melbourne must encourage new collaborations and ways of working between individuals, businesses and government institutions to achieve the shared goal of a resilient Melbourne.\nIsn't this work the state or federal\ngovernment's responsibility?\nYes. But responsibility is not limited to state and federal governments; creating a resilient Melbourne is the responsibility of us all. Councils, individuals,\ncommunities, businesses, academics, not-for-profit\norganisations - all have responsibilities and roles to play.\nWhile this strategy provides a starting point, progress towards greater resilience ultimately needs to be led by the citizens of Melbourne. A resilient city needs a large number of resilient individuals and families in its communities - such cities are better able to respond quickly and effectively to shocks and stresses.\nWhy don't I see more actions addressing our\ninfrastructure shortcomings?\nResilient Melbourne focuses on areas where local government is well placed to take a leading role. While councils manage important municipal infrastructure, much of Victoria's critical infrastructure (such as energy supply networks) and transport systems (such as major roads) is managed at the state and federal levels. Any problems with these will need significant public and private investment to fix. This document highlights several major infrastructure initiatives being undertaken at a state level that are not led by Resilient Melbourne, but that share the same aims (p. 125 and p. 137).\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n157","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["Collingwood","Sri Lankan","South Yarra","BARCELONA","Yarra","Spain","Australia","Pittsburgh","Asia","California","Tapper","Latrobe

Rockefeller Foundation (1OORC) helps cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21 st century. 10ORC provides this assistance through: funding for a Chief Resilience Officer in each member city who will lead the resilience efforts; resources for drafting a resilience strategy; access to private sector, public sector, academic, and NGO resilience tools; and membership in a global network of peer cities to share best practices and challenges. Rio Resiliente was completed in partnership with 100 Resilience Cities.\nFor more information, visit: http:\/\/www.100ResilientCities.org\nEDUARDO PAES,\nMayor of the City of Rio de Janeiro\nRio de Janeiro is today a city with many ambitions. In 2016, we released Vision Rio 500, the result of an exciting and inclusive process that enabled thousands of Rio residents to share their aspirations for the future of our city. Our residents collectively agree that Rio should be a gentle city, one that appreciates and pushes for creativity, one focused on celebrating and preserving its natural beauty, and one that is a source of opportunity and distinguished living for everyone.\nOne of Vision Rio 500\u2019s goals is to have Rio serve as a global reference for city resilience. Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Resilience Strategy is an important step towards achieving that goal, in that it defines priorities, guidelines and specific targets for developing a resilient model to share globally.\nIn January 2015, the city released \"Rio Resiliente: Diagnostic and Focus Areas,\u201d which identified Rio\u2019s main shocks and stresses. This critical work continued to be developed by the city and our citizens, thanks in large part to the energetic support of 100 Resilient Cities, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation; the culmination of which is the publication of this strategy book. Our journey to become a more resilient city was made possible by the combined guidance and effort of hundreds of thoughtful individuals within our community and experts from across Rio and around the globe. I am truly thankful to all of you and the plan you have helped us define.\nA city becomes more resilient when it is further prepared to face its challenges, be it social, environmental or economic. Resilience does not mean having an answer to every possible challenge, as nature continues to evolve. However, having a\nresilient Rio strategy enables us to build expertise and have processes in place to continue developing a city ready to support our citizens and decrease future risks to all.\nAs we look at immediate applications of resilience, one only has to look at our exciting upcoming 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We are already defining a legacy of resilience through important investments in city mobility, the creation of public spaces and opening new public venues.\nBut another kind of legacy can be incorporated, adding to what already exists at the Center of Operations Rio: an operational legacy. The Olympic Games involve complex matters related to mobility, logistics, and security, and require the extensive coordination and partnership of several governmental departments working in an integrated manner. All our efforts feed into new experiences for future traffic operations, contingency plans and first responder activities to address crises and disasters. All that we are going to learn during the Games will not disappear after the closing ceremony, and it will work to make Rio more resilient.\nIn sum, the pursuit of resilience across the globe offers an extraordinary opportunity for Rio to support our peers based on what we have and continue to learn. We envision enabling cities to develop their own integrated resilience strategies to make them more capable of dealing with their shocks and chronic stresses and, above all, to prosper. I am therefore proud to share our Rio de Janeiro Resilience Strategy with all of you and thank all of our residents and visitors for helping us embrace resilience in our lives.\nMICHAEL BERKOWITZ,\nCEO of 100 Resilient Cities\n100 Resilient Cities is honored to partner with the city of Rio de Janeiro to release its first ever resilience strategy, Rio Resiliente. The resilience roadmap outlined in this strategy is the culmination of more than two years of research, analysis, outreach, and hard work by the entire Rio Resiliente team.\nFirst and foremost, I would like to thank Mayor Eduardo Paes and congratulate him on the release of this strategy. None of this could have happened without his commitment to creating a better future for all of Rio de Janeiro, and his unwavering support for the resilience work. Additional thanks must be given to the entire Rio Resiliente team, including Chief Resilience Officer Pedro Junqueira, and Luciana Nery, Deputy CRO. Their dedication to producing a plan of this quality is already inspiring colleagues in cities all around the world. This strategy establishes Rio de Janeiro as being on the cutting edge of innovative urban solutions and sends a strong message to cities globally to join the coming urban resilience revolution along with the 100 Resilient Cities network.\nThe initiatives in Rio Resiliente not only apply a resilience lens to the short-term challenges of the city but also support long-term city planning. The resilience office research created inputs and insights that informed Rio Vision 500 and the Strategic Plan 2017-2020. The resilience strategy achieves an important alignment of these three city documents.\nThere is no doubt that the release of this strategy comes at a critical time for Rio. The challenges and pressures of climate change, urban density, social cohesion and demands on infrastructure, will continue to confront the city and its leadership.\nBut what resilience thinking allows us to do is to consider these challenges together in an integrated way. It demands that we ask ourselves how can we solve for the environmental challenges - around climate change, floods and heat islands - at the same time as we think about how to plan for and create an economically prosperous and inclusive city for all the citizens of Rio de Janeiro. It is then that we can begin to realize the full benefits of building urban resilience.\nGoing forward, we could not be more excited to continue working with Rio de Janeiro to support the implementation of key initiatives and solutions for the city and its citizens. Though today is only the beginning, this strategy gives me confidence that Rio de Janeiro will continue to be a pioneer of resilience thinking, and a leader on the world stage in executing on its strategic priorities. Congratulations once again, and let the great work ahead begin!\nSincerely,\nMichael Berkowitz President, 100 Resilient Cities\n\u201cThe resilience strategy of Rio de Janeiro proposes a set of guidelines and policies intended to bring the city and the metropolitan area the conditions to meet the challenges ahead. The ability to look to the future and recognize both the prospects and needs for the scientific, urban and social development was the most valuable experience that we in Rio Resiliente had in the sense of dreaming, proposing and organizing this set of urgent measures.\u201d\nPedro is Chief Resilience and Operations Officer of the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Head of the Center of Operations since 2013, he is responsible for coordinating integrated actions for operational agencies. His performance aims at reducing the government\u2019s response time to any incident that impacts the routine of the population. In addition, he manages the exploration and implementation of new technologies and the development of science for operations of the city. Graduated in business administration, Pedro has expertise in marketing and over 15 years of experience in Project and People Management. In the public sector, he worked in the dialogue between the public administration and the interests of civil society as a special advisor of the Municipal Departments of Transportation and Conservation and Public Services.\n\u201cBuilding resilience is to think of alternatives, it is to identify co-benefits in projects and public policies. The best way to do this is by integrating various points of view, always applying a resilience lens. Our thanks to the Resilience Champions and to the many collaborators who have supported us, it was because of their cooperation that the Resilience Strategy became more innovative and robust.\u201d\nLuciana Nery is the Deputy Chief Resilience Officer of the City of Rio de Janeiro and has over 10 years experience in the public sector in the areas of resilience, sustainability and project management. Worked as advisor to Mayor Eduardo Paes and also served as a special advisor for strategic projects to the CEO of Furnas Centrais Eletricas S.A. In 2014 she decided to dedicate herself to the theme of resilience full time. Was editor and co-author of the book \"Rio Resiliente: Diagnostic and Focus Areas\u201d. She holds a master\u2019s degree in management of international businesses (PUC-Rio \/ Universite de Grenoble) and a degree in Literature (UERJ).\n12\n13\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Resilience Strategy of the City of Rio de Janeiro aims to tackle the city\u2019s main vulnerabilities and to make it more resilient.\nRio\u2019s Resilience Strategy is the culmination of a multi-year partnership of the City of Rio de Janeiro with 100 Resilient Cities, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation.\nUrban resilience is defined as the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow, no matter the chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nRio strives to become a global reference for resilience by 2035. This ambition is a core tenet of the Vision Rio 500, a pioneering citizen engagement project released in 2016 that focuses on the development of a long-term vision for the city. The creation of Vision Rio 500 provided Rio\u2019s citizens, of all ages and social background, a unique opportunity to share their aspirations for what Rio de Janeiro should become by 2065, the city\u2019s 500th anniversary.\nOur vision for a more resilient Rio is based on developing a better relationship between the city and its water, infrastructure, and most importantly, its citizens. A resilient Rio is one that embraces its water, builds for the future and empowers its citizens.\nRio de Janeiro\u2019s Resilience Strategy is an intermediary step between the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, which targets the near future, and Vision Rio 500, which involves aspirations for the longer term. The Resilience Strategy establishes goals focused on resilience issues identified through the 100 Resilient Cities Preliminary Risk Assessment, a process that involved more than 300 people between 2014 and 2016, resulting in the discovery of the main shocks and stresses affecting Rio.\nRio\u2019s Resilience Strategy helps define new projects with longer-term results and clear benefits aimed at diminishing the city\u2019s vulnerabilities while increasing its resilience. The strategic proposal recommends multiple programs including the creation of the Rio Panel of Climate Change; the development of a disaster recovery plan for the metropolitan area; an agency for the promotion of circular economy; and a course on Urban Resilience, to reach 100,000 school children until 2020. All the projects also entirely aligned with Vision 500 and aim at achieving the aspirations of the citizens of Rio.\nThe Resilience Strategy also features a selection of projects from the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, many of which were proposed by Rio Resiliente, the Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Resilience Office, including LED public lighting, individual resilience indicators, an urban solar strategy, and an open, large-scale online course on urban resilience to train school teachers, public servants and the general population.\nAll the initiatives in the Resilience Strategy involve concepts, projects and specific actions that are transversal, multidisciplinary and aim at reducing the shocks and chronic stresses of the city. Connection, collaboration and the identification of co-benefits comprise the basis of the Resilience Strategy and constitute the main values of Rio Resiliente.\nThus, the City of Rio has developed the following goals based on its resilience vision:\n#1 : Better understand and mitigate impacts of severe weather and climate change\n#2: Mobilize Rio to be prepared to respond to extreme weather events and other shocks\n#3 : Cultivate green, cool, safe and flexible urban spaces\n#4: Provide high quality, basic services to all citizens, through sustainable and resilient use of resources\n#5: Promote an inclusive, diversified, circular and low-carbon economy\n#6: Increase the overall resilience of citizens and promote social cohesion\nUrban resilience is defined as the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow, no matter the chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nThis publication outlines the Strategy of Resilience of the City of Rio de Janeiro. It is the result of more than two years of work and the start of a new phase: the implementation of projects with clear benefits to increase the city\u2019s resilience from an integrated point of view, and fully aligned to the city\u2019s most recent strategy documents: the Strategic Plan 2017-2020 and Vision Rio 500.\nThe Resilience Strategy is being released in a key moment of the city\u2019s transformation: 451 years of history, the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and a vision for the next 50 years, named Vision Rio 500. The Resilience Strategy was developed from 2014 through 2016 by the City of Rio de Janeiro, with the direct participation of 300 people, and more than 800 people engaged, from various backgrounds, with the support of 100 Resilient Cities', pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, which aims to support resilience in cities around the world.\nThe development of the Resilience Strategy is led by Rio Resiliente, a multidisciplinary team linked to the Center of Operations Rio (COR). The incorporation of the resilience theme by the COR took place primarily due to its integrative and horizontal nature, which favors transversal analyses\nof city challenges. Furthermore, the COR has access to a multitude of data regarding the daily routine of the city and many tools for the mobilization of resources and communication with society. The COR therefore fosters an ideal environment for long-term urban planning that incorporates the management of recurrent city risks.\nThe development of the Resilience Strategy involved two phases. The first identified the main risks to city resilience, its vulnerabilities. The end of this first phase was marked by the January 2015 release of \"Rio Resilient: Diagnostic and Focus Areas\u201d, a book that included a preface by the former Vice-President of the United States, Al Gore. This document identifies Rio\u2019s main shocks and chronic stresses, features a classification of city\u2019s risks and an analysis of city projects related to resilience and what they represent in terms of prevention, monitoring, mobilization, communication and constant learning.\nOnce the city\u2019s resilience priorities were mapped, the city began the second phase of the 100 Resilient Cities program aimed at defining a core resilience strategy. Members of the Rio Resiliente team consulted multiple expert working groups throughout 2015, with the goals of establishing\n1. http :\/\/www. 10Oresifentcities.org.\ntop priorities for public action and capturing stakeholder perceptions surrounding the perceived positive impacts of these actions for the city.\nIn June 2015 the City of Rio began a discovery process to identify what citizens wished for the city over the next 50 years. It was named Vision Rio 500 in reference to the city\u2019s 500th anniversary in 2065 and involved thousands of citizens in various sessions, meetings, debates and online consultation. Soon after, the city started to develop its Strategic Plan 2017-2020, using an innovative approach of ample consultation and transversely of themes, unlike the former ones. Furthermore, this Strategic Plan is fully aligned to Vision Rio 500, establishing goals, timeframes and budgets that, together, constitute a first step towards achieving the aspirations for the next 50 years. Those two plans, for 2020 and 2065 were released in March 1, 2016 during a ceremony at the Museum of Tomorrow, marking a new phase in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s history; one in which Rio\u2019s own citizens helped develop an ambition of what they wanted in their city and how they intend to achieve that vision.\nThe Resilience Strategy points to initiatives that constitute an intermediary step between Plan 2017-2020, which targets the near future; and Vision Rio 500, which is about longer-term aspirations. This Strategy also features a small selection of projects from the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, because of their relevance in increasing overall city resilience.\nDuring 2014 through 2015, Rio Resiliente involved more than 300 people in a series of workshops and interviews focused on identifying the city\u2019s main threats to resilience. With the support of the 100 Resilient Cities\u2019 methodology, public managers, service company representatives (e.g. trash collection, electricity and water utilities), academics, community leaders and other members of civil society were interviewed.\nThe Rio Resiliente team assessed resilience across socioeconomic, behavioral, management and climate issues. The team\u2019s findings informed the identification of Rio\u2019s key shocks and stresses:\nI\t- INTENSE RAINS\nStrong rains cause flooding and landslides, damage buildings, provoke economic losses and spread diseases through contamination of sewage and solid waste in the rainwater, such as leptospirosis and diarrhea. They can also prompt energy black-outs, lower public safety, toppling of trees and traffic accidents.\nIn 2010, between April 6 and 7, 13 inches of rain in 24 hours caused the death of 66 people, mostly due to landslides. Climate models indicate that rains in the Southeast of Brazil might become less frequent, but that rainfall can be concentrated in a shorter period of time, which increases potential to cause damages.\nII\t- STRONG WINDS\nThe strongest winds registered in Rio de Janeiro reach the speed of 10OKm\/h. Many climate models indicate the possibility of increase in frequency and intensity of\nwinds in Brazil. In Rio, strong winds can cause damage to rooftops, power lines and trees, with the blockage of streets, closure of bridges, paralysation of waterways and threaten human lives.\nIII\t- HEAT ISLANDS AND HEAT WAVES\nHeat waves are extreme climate events with high mortality potential. Heat waves occur when temperatures remain high for multiple days (above the 98th percentile in Rio\u2019s case). With climate change, it is estimated that heatwaves will become even more extreme. Besides death, heat waves generate thermal discomfort, increase in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, increase in stress and loss of productivity, mainly when people work under sun exposure. High temperature also causes an increase in the consumption of electric energy, with possibility of blackouts due to excessive demand; and also more dry days which, increase the chance of fires in slopes.\nHeat islands happen in areas which, due to geography and urbanization patterns, tend to accumulate more hot air in comparison to surrounding areas. Rio has had a significant increase in its heat islands since 1980. Examples from around the world indicate that neighborhoods, which are exceedingly hot have lower economic development and quality of life.\nIV\t- SEA LEVEL RISE\nA study developed in 2010 indicates that if the sea level rises by half a meter, then approximately 30 km2 of Rio de Janeiro would be at risk of being submerged by sea waterT For example, one at-risk area surrounds the Baixada de Jacarepagua lake system, whose water-covered area can\nexpand and reach inhabited districts including Itanhanga, Rio das Pedras, Vargem Pequena and Vargem Grande, which are already susceptible to storm surges.\nThe rise in the average level and reach of storm surges may also affect coastal ecosystems, cause the salinization of potable water, damage streets infrastructure, and overburden rainwater retention drainage system, increasing the number of floods. Rio de Janeiro\u2019s identity is closely intertwined with its beaches. Sea level rise poses a serious threat to Rio\u2019s iconic beaches and their key economic pull from tourism.\nSea level rise can also affect neighboring cities located around the Guanabara Bay, with negative consequences to the economy, mobility and population health.\nV\t- EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS\nThe mosquito Aedes aegypti, endemic in Rio since 1982, is a vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika. The presence of these mosquitoes may increase through climate change-driven outcomes such as increase in urban heat islands that accelerate reproduction and extend the months that reproduction occurs throughout the year. Prevention systems and victim epidemic treatment are applied irregularly in the metropolitan region, which constitutes a vulnerability for Rio.\nVI\t- DROUGHTS\nDroughts driven by insufficient rain throughout the southeastern regions of Brazil after the summer of 2011 caused considerable water scarcity for citizens. Additionally, given Brazil\u2019s reliance on hydroelectric power, the lack of water caused electricity prices to increase, making it less affordable for the majority of users. In the City of Rio, 92% of residences\n2. Sea Level Rise Vulnerability for the City of Rio de Janeiro. Source: Colepao Estudos Cariocas. Felipe Cerbella Mandarino, Luiz Roberto Arueira - IPP\/Prefeitura da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro, 2012\ndepend on water supplied from the River Guandu Treatment Station located outside the city limits in Nova Iguapu. This constitutes a vulnerability, as Rio is heavily dependent on a sole source of water, with limited alternatives actively used to date.\nVII\t- SATURATION OF THE ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE\nBetween 2004 and 2014, one million new vehicles were added to the existing fleet of 1.5 million cars3. Despite recent gains in average city commuting times following the implementation of Bus Rapid Transit, Bus Rapid System and better traffic operations, traffic jams are still a major chronic stress of the city, causing the following negative impacts:\n-\tWorsened air quality, affecting human health, such as asthma\n-\tIncreased sound pollution and diminishing \"walkability\u201d in the city\n-\tIncreased traffic accidents with fatalities\n-\tIncreased greenhouse gas emissions\n-\tDecreased productivity and increased economic losses to companies and citizens\n-\tIncreased transit delays for emergency vehicles\n-\tDecreased quality of life, because increased commuting diminishes free time for leisure, study and family.\nVIII\t- ACCIDENTS WITH URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE\nIn 1900, Rio had little more than 800,000 inhabitants; in 1950, 2,377,451; and in 2015, the Brazilian Institute for Statistics and Geography estimates Rio is home to more than 6,500,000 residents. This population growth has occurred without concurrent expansions and modernizations of urban infrastructure, causing increases in infrastructure-associated accidents. The main consequences of accidents in the urban infrastructure are:\n-\tIncreases in traffic delays due to accidents with trains, buses and subways\n-\tGas explosions and leaks\n-\tRegular and long-term power outages associated with underground electric reactor explosions and\/or damage to aerial power lines\n-\tWater supply disruption due to increased bursting of high-pressure water and sewage pipes\nIn general, the challenges to be tackled regarding urban infrastructure are related to their predicted asset life time, such as the adequate service time and related maintenance for bridges, overpasses, antennas, canopies, rooftops, seaside kiosks, windows, and others.\nIX\t- AGGLOMERATION OF PEOPLE WITH IMPACT IN NORMALCY\nThe presence of a large number of people in the same place can pose risks to those involved and take a city out of its normality. Rio\u2019s street Carnival parades move millions of people and events such as New Year\u2019s Eve gather around 2 million people to watch the fireworks in Copacabana. Music festivals, the World Cup and the Olympic Games also affect the normal movements of the city. Besides these, some events happen with little or no previous warning, like demonstrations and protests. Public manifestations are a valid tool for democracy, whose main purpose is to show the dissatisfaction of segments and groups in society. More specifically, the agglomeration of people, depending on how it develops, may cause the following impacts:\n-\tObstruction of streets without previous warning, resulting in traffic jams.\n-\tAttacks and depredation of the private and public property in case of extreme violence\n-\tSound pollution and disturbance of resident living\n-\tInterruption of essential services, due to strikes or demonstrations\n-\tDecrease in the perception of personal safety.\nX\t- CRIMINAL ACTS IN URBAN SPACES\nThe actsion of criminal groups can affect the resilience of the city in many ways, causing abrupt shocks, like crime waves; but also chronic stresses, like increasing the sensation of insecurity, which affects negatively real estate prices, tourism and the psychological health of citizens. The main consequences are:\n-\tDepredation and vandalism\n-\tDifficulty in the provision of public services and resulting offer of clandestine services\n-\tThreats to the civil society, like murders, thefts, abuses, etc.\n-\tDepreciation of property values and economic depression.\nSafety and public order are key elements to the resilience of a city, because they are linked directly to the preservation of life, property and the physical and psychological wellbeing of citizens.\nXI\t- INSUFFICIENT SANITATION4\nIn the city of Rio, 57% of people have access to the complete cycle of basic sanitation. The unequal access to sanitation causes various impacts in public health, increasing the number of infectious diseases, including those transmitted by Aedes aegypti, and infant mortality.\nInsufficient sanitation causes environmental and economic degradation of the areas surrounding all types of bodies of water, reaching mainly the ecosystems of the Guanabara and Sepetiba bays, lakes, rivers and beaches, with various negative impacts to human health, tourism and the city\u2019s branding. The metropolitan governance for sanitation is in its early stages, similar to infrastructural investments and the connections of the sewage lines to treatment stations. Illegal sewer plumbing pollutes nascent rivers that could be utilized for water consumption. It also mixes with the city\u2019s rainwater system, lowering the city\u2019s capacity to absorb intense rains, resulting in flooding in case of heavy rains.\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro was founded 451 years ago, and today it is the second largest city in Brazil in terms of population and GDP. It is a large city with 6,5 million people, in a metropolitan area with more than 10 million inhabitants.\nThe city developed between the sea and the mountains. It is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the Guanabara Bay and the Sepetiba Bay and hosts three urban forests, the Forest of Tijuca, the Pedra Branca Massif and the Geripino Massif. Together, they form a unique scenery, which makes Rio famous worldwide for its natural beauty. It is also known as the Wonderful City and is the main tourist destiny in Brazil, visited by two million international tourists every year.\nBeyond the natural wealth, politics and culture have always been present in the city. Capital of Brazil between 1763 and 1960, Rio de Janeiro harbored many important political and historical events, and recently hosted major events, such as the World Cup in 2014 and, soon, the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016.\nThe economy of the city is mainly based on services -86%. The rest is largely comprised by the industrial sector, with intense participation of Brazilian multinationals like Petrobras and Vale, in the fields of oil and minerals, respectively. Only a small portion is related to agriculture - less than 1 %.\nThe Human Development Index of the city, in 2010, is 0.799, and it varies from a high to 0.970 in the most prosperous neighborhood, to 0.700 in the poorest. This disparity in development can also be perceived in the map\n26\nshowing the Social Progress Index of Rio de Janeiro on p. 25.\nRio\u2019s commitment towards resilience is demonstrated through many initiatives, such as the creation of the Center of Operations Rio, the acquisition of a weather radar, heavy investments on slope contention and flood control, installation of early warning systems in favelas and evacuation drills in areas prone to landslides. In 2014 the city created Rio Resiliente, a strategic office that acts as an interlocutor between other city departments, private sector, NGOs and international institutions, next to planning and developing its own projects aimed at increasing the resilience of Rio.\nIn June 2015 the city of Rio started an ample process of public consultation for the formulation of a vision for the next 50 years, named Vision Rio 500, because in 2015 Rio celebrated the 450\u00b0 anniversary of its foundation. The objective was to engage the population and answer the following question: What Do We Want for the Future of our City?\nStarting from the priorities and insights identified at the development of Vision Rio 500, a process for engagement began for the development of Strategic Plan 2017-2020, which defines specific goals, indicators and budget. Those are first steps towards achieving the objectives of Vision 500.\nRio Resiliente contributed actively to Vision Rio 500 and the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, by identifying transversal impacts and co-benefits of resilience to proposed goals and projects.\nCONNECT\nWe recognize that excellent practices and initiatives exist in the public, private and academic sectors and in the civil society, and that connections between these parties can increase the resilience of our City significantly. Rio Resiliente holds as a main principle the connection between parties with common objectives in order to profit more from the co-benefits of collaboration.\nCOLLABORATE\nCollaboration is at the core of resilience projects. Collaboration means even more success for all parties, and therefore we promote and foster with great care our strategic relationships within the City Hall, with civil society, NGOs and the private sector, always looking to openly share information, ideas and bring people together in our projects and initiatives.\nCO-BENEFITS\nThis is our raison d\u2019etre, as the transversal analysis of impacts and identification of co-benefits can add quality to already existing projects and make a difference in evaluating and comparing business cases. By looking through the resilience lens, Rio Resiliente can help the city tackle more challenges with the same initiative, the result of ample and intersectorial analyses of impacts.\nRESILIENCE CHAMPION\nSergio Besserman is president of the Municipal Institute Pereira Passos and the Sustainable Development Technical Chamber of the City of Rio de Janeiro. He is a Professor of Economics and Environmental Engineering at PUC-RJ. He is advisor to various organizations such as Fundagao Roberto Marinho, WWF, Ci-Brazil, ITDP, Funbio, Bolsa Verde, and Rio Clima. He writes regularly for the newspaper 0 Globo.

One of the pioneers on the theme resilience in Brazil, he is part of the Steering Committee of Rio Resiliente since its inception in 2014.\nIDENTIFIED SHOCKS AND CHRONIC STRESSES\nHeavy rains, strong winds, waves and heat islands, sea level rising, epidemics and pandemics, prolonged drought, saturation of road infrastructure, accidents with urban infrastructure, overcrowding impacting normality, insufficient sanitation.\nFOCUS AREAS\nClimate Change, Socioeconomic Resilience, Resilient Behavior, and Resilient Management.\nThe City Resilience Framework\nDeveloped by Arup with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, The City Resilience Framework (CRF) provides a lens to understand the complexity of cities and the drivers that contribute to their resilience, and a common language that enables cities to share knowledge and experiences. Rio Resiliente uses this tool to evaluate the scope and quality of the City\u2019s initiatives and projects.\nThe CRF is built on four essential dimensions of urban resilience: Health & Wellbeing; Economy & Society; Infrastructure & Environment; and Leadership & Strategy.\nRESILIENCE INDICATORS\nRio de Janeiro, like many cities, has a complicated ecosystem of natural and built environments that require an integrated resilience strategy The greatest challenges come from three primary areas - water, infrastructure, and social vulnerability. Water can be both abundant or scarce, life provider or disease vector, and thus needs to be better managed. Infrastructure must be permanently and sustainably improved to meet the needs, protections and expectations of citizens. Social vulnerability must be reduced, because citizens with insufficient access to basic services are the most exposed and take longer to recover from shocks and chronic stresses. Climate change and economic instability are multipliers that can worsen or exacerbate these challenges.\nA. RELATIONSHIP OF THE CITY WITH WATER\n\"Rio\u201d means \"river\u201d, and Rio de Janeiro is all about water: it is in the name, in the images that attract visitors and in the self-identity of Cariocas. However, mismanagement, wasteful practices, over-reliance on a single source of potable water and disorganized urbanization also mean that water constitutes a major challenge to the resilience of Rio.\nWater seems to be abundant in the lakes, mountains, beaches and in the thousands of rivers that cross the city. But, as the Southeast of Brazil experienced from 2011 onwards, water scarcity is a real threat, due to the increased irregularity of rain patterns in the region, which unpredictably intersperse intense rainfall with longer periods of drought.\nThe production of energy from water also disrupts the flow of the river and lowers the amount of water available to the Guandu system, which supplies water to 92% of the people living in Rio and is located in the neighboring city of Nova Iguapu. This over-reliance on a single source of water makes the city fragile to any irregularity of supply or upstream disturbances not in the hands the Rio municipality.\nPolluted bodies of water affect the integrity of ecosystems and contribute to an array of health problems, ranging from vector-borne diseases to increased infant mortality. Insufficient sanitation, poor waste management, industrial pollutants and lack of metropolitan governance translate into increased pollution of the Guanabara Bay and the river systems of the West Zone, among other affected areas. The pollution of beaches also negatively affects the image of the city and the economic potential of the coastal area.\nThe strong rains during summer cause flooding and landslides in the city, causing significant economic losses and fatalities, mainly in the vulnerable communities in the mountain slopes. In April of 2010, 66 people died in the favelas after record-breaking storm, and the city\u2019s infrastructure was heavily damaged.\nThe global tendency to sea level rise, estimated to range from 28 to 98cm in 2100, according to IPCC 2013, may cause the salinization of rivers and aquifers, thus reducing availability of water for industries and for human consumption.\nB. RELATIONSHIP OF THE CITY WITH ITS INFRASTRUCTURE\nThe city of Rio was founded 450 years ago in a beautiful and yet challenging natural environment. There was an intense population growth in the 20th century, and now 6.8 million people must live and thrive in this expanding and densifying urban space.\nDue to fast and disorganized growth, urban spaces are often poorly equipped to deal with the needs of citizens. Some areas of the city lack adequate access to basic services, like sanitation and legal access to water and energy. Macro drainage of rainwater is often insufficient, thus contributing to flooding. The expansion of the city towards the West put pressure on the creation of new infrastructure for the new demands. In favelas, many houses were built in areas prone to landslides, often without proper design and materials, and investments on social housing has been insufficient to reach demand.\nThe quality of the urban spaces varies within the city, with many neighborhoods lacking green and recreational areas, artistic expressions and enough businesses to employ residents and diminish need for commuting for employment.\nPoor sanitation and inadequate disposal of solid waste in the city and metropolitan area are the greatest contributors to water pollution.\nThe coverage of primary health care has increased in the past years, but still must be expanded to reach even more people. As the number of cars increase and people live farther away from jobs, mobility has become less efficient and traffic is often congested. The investments in mobility tend to be reactive and often do not anticipate future needs.\nStrong winds are acute shocks that cause many disruptions in the city, such as damaged power lines, toppled trees and various other accidents.\nEnergy, water and waste are resources whose potential is underutilized. The city does not produce its own energy, despite the immense potential for solar energy production. Water is wasted as it flows along outdated infrastructure and is spent unwisely5. Solid waste, which carries the potential to be reused, recycled and transformed, is mostly buried in landfills, not generating value and causing negative environmental impact.\nThe sea level rise and the intensification of storm surges put at risk the coastal infrastructure and the income from tourism. Even though the city has made significant advances in mobilization for shocks and disasters with the implementation of the Center of Operations, mobilization of resources at city and metropolitan levels should be better integrated, so that the region is ready to respond adequately to recurrent or rare shocks.\nC. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EACH CITIZEN WITH THE CITY\nSocial inequality means that there are different cities for different citizens. Favelas and the \"formal\u201d city are in close proximity throughout Rio de Janeiro, and yet the experience of living in one or the other varies immensely. The provision of services and economic opportunities are unequal, with insufficient access to sanitation, transportation, health services, culture, sports, education and employment.\nCitizens must be aware of how their behavior impacts their everyday life in the city. The conscientious use of water and energy not only conserves natural resources, but also means lower bills and taxes, and guarantees safer and steadier supply. The proper disposal of solid waste lowers the risk of flooding due to clogged pipes. Protecting trees not only helps carbon sequestration and biodiversity but, more tangibly to citizens, reduces temperature and air and noise pollution while improving access to green space. Using public instead of private transportation reduces air pollution, carbon emissions and diminishes traffic congestions. To support the reuse and recycling of materials is to lower demand on natural resources and create a market for composting and solid waste, both of which have immense potential for job creation, as is the case in cities worldwide.\nCriminality lowers trust in the public spaces, damages social cohesion and cause psychological and economic losses to citizens. It is recognized around the world that the most socially vulnerable populations are the ones who suffer the most impact from natural disasters and economic downturns. They also take longer to recover and rebound from shocks. Efforts to make the city more resilient, therefore, must acknowledge the increased vulnerability of those with little economic resources or social safety nets and act upon it with special attention.\nFew schools in the city, public or private, teach children resilience to the shocks and stresses of the city, what impacts of climate change they may experience or what constitutes sustainable consumption of resources. Consequently, few citizens know how to act in the course of a disaster and what risks they face in their neighborhoods and everyday lives, let alone how to prevent and prepare for those.\nClimate change is increasing the intensity and number of extreme weather events and also destabilizing provision of resources like water, energy and food. Brazilians cannot anymore count on the abundance of resources, and the risk of scarcity must be incorporated in public policies and individual behavior. Those risks, for their potential impacts, cannot be addressed separately by different spheres of government, city departments or discrete projects. Citizens and city administration must collaborate to prevent and monitor those risks, to incorporate new knowledge and, moreover, to find opportunities to thrive despite challenges posed by shocks and chronic stresses.\nUrban heat islands are worsening due to increasing urbanization and warming climate. As demonstrated in cities worldwide, increased temperatures pose a threat to human health, reduce productivity, cause thermal stress and reduce walkability in a city.\nOur vision of a resilient Rio is more than just a city that protects itself and its Cariocas from a wide range of shocks and stresses - it is a city that supports a fulfilling life for citizens of all ages and backgrounds in the coming decades by embracing our social, environmental and infrastructure issues head on. We see a future Rio that is safe, beautiful and gentle, as well as economically prosperous and just. In order to tackle our challenges, we must make all aspects of the city and our people more resilient, specifically we will...\nA.\tEMBRACE OUR WATER\nwater in the rivers, lakes and beaches will be clean, fostering vibrant tourism and economic activities; it will be managed and consumed conscientiously and there will be potable water for the metropolitan region at all times.\nB.\tBUILD FOR OUR FUTURE\nthe urban spaces will be safe, green, climate-smart and will promote the well-being of citizens; no Carioca will live in a high-risk area; and housing and high-quality basic services, especially sanitation, will be available for all.\nC.\tEMPOWER OUR PEOPLE\nCariocas will have plenty of jobs within a diversified, inclusive, low-carbon and circular economy; they will participate actively in the decisions that affect them; and will be ready to learn, prevent, mobilize and grow from the shocks and stresses that affect the city and the planet.\n37\nFLAGSHIP INITIATIVE #1.A:\nEstablish Rio de Janeiro Panel on Climate Change\nDESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE:\nSet up a Climate Change Panel for the city of Rio de Janeiro involving experts from various scientific fields to study climate trends with the Panel of Climate Change (IPCC 2013) and future iterations as basis. This panel, pioneer in Latin America, is inspired by a similar initiative in New York City, and its mission will be to investigate, publish and communicate results of climate change research and its impacts on the city of Rio, as well as provide support for decision-making on urban planning and inform other fields of knowledge and the civil society.\nThe Panel aims to incorporate state of the art scientific knowledge on climate, at global and national levels, in order to indicate possible climate change scenarios and its impacts specifically to Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan region. The reports released should foster scientific research on the effects of climate change at city level and foster conversation on the related environmental, social and economic aspects.\nFurthermore, the Panel encourages a connection between climate change and other disciplines, with focus on transversal analyses of impacts, for example: a) analysis of how extreme temperatures impact vector-borne diseases such as Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, b) economic valuation of various scenario-based impacts of sea level rise. The knowledge generated will support public policies for the mitigation and adaptation of climate change in Rio, specifically those related to strong rains and winds, sea level rise, heat islands and waves, droughts and epidemics.\nThe initiative to create a Panel on Climate Change for Rio was proposed by Rio Resiliente and the Mayor\u2019s Office and is in its planning stage.\nVISION RIO 500\nAspiration (III.2.b): The City will be ready and adapted to face climate change and its impacts, having mapped and planned for its main threats; Aspiration (II.2.a).

This portfolio must incorporate the conclusions related to climate in the local level, as informed by the Rio de Janeiro Panel on Climate Change (initiative 1 A).\nHaving as a basis the citywide GHG emission inventories and the Climate Change Adaptation Municipal Plan, led by the Secretary of Environment, the city of Rio will develop a portfolio of actionable projects focused on targeting the greatest emitters, with the establishment of goals, and fostering better management of resources though the promotion of a circular economy (initiatives 5A and 5B). The plan for mitigation and reduction of GHG emissions will involve projects related to renewable energy, low-carbon economy and sectors, and transportation.\nThe Portfolio of Climate Mitigation and Adaptation will aim to provide guidelines for urban interventions of Rio de Janeiro, so that urban planning, public works and maintenance internalize concepts and practices that make Rio more resilient to climate change. Those projects will be related to rainfall harvesting, permeable paving, tree planting, green roofs, among others (see Goal #3, \"Cultivate green, cool, safe and flexible urban spaces\u201d), and must be formulated already considering available and innovative financial options.\nThe portfolio\u2019s objective it to foster the development of projects to tackle the vulnerabilities of the city to strong rains and winds, heat islands and waves, sea level rise, epidemics and accidents with urban infrastructure.\nThe first stages for the implementation of a portfolio of climate mitigation and adaptation is featured in the Strategic Plan 2017-2020 and Rio Resiliente supports its development on an amplified scope.\nVISION RIO 500\nAspiration (III.2.b): The City will be ready and adapted to face climate change and its impacts, having mapped and planned\nfor its main threats; Aspiration (III.2.a): No family in the city will live in risk areas.\nSTRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020\nInitiative 3.12 - Expected Results: Better knowledge about GEE emissions, climate interactions and air quality, for mitigation, disaster prevention, health policies and increased quality of life.

In this role she advises and supports city leaders to develop and implement mitigation strategies against greenhouse emissions and climate risks. She also works in close collaboration with Rio Resiliente.\nINITIATIVE #1.C:\nMonitor Climate Trends and Impacts\nESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE\nMonitor and support research on climate trends and impacts, analyzing socioeconomic data in order to generate crosscutting analyses of costs and benefits of projects and public policies for climate. The risk modelling will be developed with the support of georeferenced risk mapping (initiative 1D), involving shocks and chronic stresses such as strong rains and winds, heat islands, air quality, flooding and landslides, high tides and storm surges, and epidemics.\nThe aim of this initiative is to establish permanent, integrated and multidisciplinary climate monitoring, with the involvement of city departments, other spheres of government, NGOs and citizens. To this continuous and evolving monitoring, other analyses will be added, for example, such as the social and economic impacts of sea level rise in the next decades. This initiative also entails the monitoring of the winds in the city, for the development of historical data and support for academic research on the theme, adding to the existing knowledge about rains. Finally, this project supports research on the interactions of heat waves and heat islands with the air quality of Rio.\nFurthermore, the monitoring of climate trends and impacts involves the active participation of citizens, through the voluntary and collaborative collection of climate data with the use of simple homemade sensors, thus supporting actions of Citizen Science.\nThis initiative, including the monitoring and Citizen Science, was proposed by Rio Resiliente and incorporated by the Strategic Plan 2017-2020. Itis currently partly being implemented, as the Center of Operations is stating to monitor heat waves and incorporate wind data already, and partly in the planning phase, for example for the sea level rise studies.\nVISION RIO 500\nAspiration (II1.2.b): The City will be prepared and adapted to\nface climate change and its impacts, having mapped and planned for its main threats; Aspiration (III.2.a): No family in the city will live in risk areas; Aspiration (III.2,c): All citizens will be informed, prepared and engaged to deal with climate change impacts.

Togetl ler with her team she collected, modeled and studied temperature data from Rio Alert and other similar institutions, aiming to improve the descriptions of such variable. \u201cAfter this work, we increased our comprehension about heat waves, which is a first step towards building a set of measures to minimize the negative impacts of extreme heat to the population of Rio\u201d.\nINITIATIVE #1.D:\nIntegrate Multi-hazard Risk Maps\nDESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE\nDevelop multi-hazard assessment mapping, with the use of computational models, real-time sensoring and Big Data, for better integration of the main risks that affect the urban space of Rio. These maps aim to support analyses about possible interactions of risks in the urban space, mainly but not limited to those related to intense rains and winds, heat islands and waves, air quality, flooding and landslides, high tides and storm surges, epidemics and accidents with urban infrastructure.\nThe aim is to identify the interactions between climate-related challenges and other types of risks in the city, in order to form a solid knowledge basis for public managers, academia and cities. It must allow for a comprehensive visualization of risks and their impacts in the region, to help identify priorities for intervention. For example, it is known that excessive heat and pollution can diminish the lifespan of concrete structures, with implications in the durability of urban infrastructure. Moreover, rain flooding and overflowing of rivers can affect mobility. Therefore a map with storm flooding patterns is supported by Strategic Plan 2017-2020 (Initiative 3.10, Flood Control). The Center of Operations Rio monitors in real time the heat waves of the city. These two types of maps constitute examples of risks that will be present in the multihazard assessment maps, which will allow for studies on cascading effects.\nWith the support of Big Data, historic data from sensors and climate scenarios, these integrated climate risk maps become sophisticated tools for urban planning and, in case of crises, for the deployment of sufficient and adequate first response. This initiative promotes the collaboration between public departments and public concessions.\nin its early stages and was fully incorporated by Strategic Plan 2017-2020.\nVISION RIO 500\nAspiration (III.2.b): The City will be ready and adapted to face climate change and its impacts, having mapped and planned for its main threats; Aspiration (II.2.a).

He has a degree on Environmental Sciences by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and is co-founder of a socioenvironmental consultancy.\nINITIATIVE #3.C\nImprove Resilience in Mobility\nDESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE\nThe mobility projects planned for Rio involve initiatives that can contribute to increase the resilience of the city. All those projects - new Bus Rapid Transit lines, such as Transbrasil, which will move approximately 450,000 people daily; the segregated lines of the Bus Rapid System; Light Rail Vehicle; and many miles of bike lanes - involve interventions in the urban space that can contribute to minimize many shocks and chronic stresses of the city.\nProjects for mobility must be aligned with the Portfolio of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation, initiative 1B, and must involve in their planning analysis of impact of microclimates in neighborhoods, effects on \"walkability\u201d, exposure to climate shocks, such as strong rains and winds (including those related to drainage and coastal protection against sea level rise); and also adequate public lighting and impacts in the sensation of security. The utilization of low emission fuels is essential to the development of a resilient mobility. The integration of different transportation modals cannot be regarded solely as a means of reducing commuting time, but also for its ability to increase flexibility and generate redundancy, so that eventual interruption of a modal can be mitigated by the use of others.\nAn ample analysis of the co-benefits of resilience in mobility projects constitute opportunity for better access to finance options, considering the global movement towards the financing of climate-smart projects, whose longer utility is ensured by considering climate scenarios. The application of a resilience lens in mobility supports the city to deal with shocks and stresses like strong rains and winds, heat islands\nand waves, sea level rise, accidents with urban infrastructure, agglomeration of people with impact in normalcy, criminal acts in the urban space, and saturation of road infrastructure.\nRIO VISION 500\nAspiration (111.1.d): City mobility will be sustainable, supported by green technologies and intelligent urban planning; Aspiration (IV. 1.a) The city will be more compact and densified in tandem with the existing infrastructure; Aspiration (IV. 1 ,b) Everyone will be able to ride all over the city using high quality and integrated public transportation.\nSTRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020\nInitiative 4.05 - Improvements on the roads and on the quality of buses travel; Initiative 4.06 - Implementation of exclusive lanes for public transportation.\nVALUE AND CO-BENEFITS\nIncrease in the flexibility and robustness of the transport system; support for the development of green, safe, and walkable urban spaces; positive impact in the microclimate of neighborhoods; increased attraction for climate-related finance options; reduction in air pollution; and reduction of GHG emissions.\nINDICATORS\nPercentage of the population that commutes daily via high capacity transportation; amount of funding attracted by climate-smart mobility projects; lower concentration of transport-related air pollution; lower GHG emissions.\nFOCAL POINTS\tPOTENTIAL PARTNERS\nRio Resiliente and departments of transportation and FPJ, ITDP-Brasil, C40, departments of public construction planning.\tworks and cultural heritage, universities, private sector\nGOAL #3 Cultivate green, cool, safe and flexible urban spaces\nINITIATIVE #3.D Equal access to Culture\nWith the aim of encouraging the symbolic, economic and social mobility of carioca cultural agents, this initiative consists in the expansion of investments in actions with a territorial impact, ensuring capillarity, coverage and geographic scope of public funding for culture.\nAspiration (1.3.b) Valued territorial culture and equitably distributed cultural goods.\nPublic investments supporting local culture, with broad participation of the community; increasing social cohesion\nNumber of agents with community profile trained for territorial impact per year.

In 2014 and 2015 the Southeast of Brazil experienced low rainfall volume. Consequently, the integrated reservoir of Guandu reached 13% of its capacity, a worrying stage considering the fact that this source provides water to 92% of Rio\u2019s citizens. The preparation of a water strategy has five objectives; I) Develop a preliminary diagnosis of the water situation in the city of Rio; II) Establish an integrated approach for the urban water; III) Develop projects based on successful cases of water management; IV) Align a strategy specifically for the metropolitan region, with the engagement of actors from the different governmental spheres; V) Develop an implementation roadmap.\nThe water strategy must indicate alternative means to improve access to water, reduce consumption and deal with the urban water cycle more resiliently. The water supply must be constant to all citizens and less dependent on a single\nsource. Therefore, the water basins of the river Guandu, located outside the limits of the city of Rio de Janeiro, must be revitalized, in order to guarantee steady water flow throughout the year; and universal sanitation network must be implemented, preventing the contamination of water bodies.\nThe diversification of the water matrix in Rio de Janeiro entails deepening the knowledge about alternative sources, such as watershed in the urban forests (there are three forests located within city limits) and the potential for rainwater harvesting, mainly in rooftops. The harvesting and reserve of water in the city must integrate gray infrastructure to a sustainable and resilient use of ecosystems. The water cycle in the city, little explored and understood yet, should be regarded as a whole, so that future interventions do not impact it negatively, by enhancing flooding or dry periods.\nFora resilient management of water, it is essential to utilize this resource more efficiently and, therefore, the water strategy must also include the active development of new habits, practices and technologies which induce the reduction in consumption; and should identify opportunities for the usage\nPOTENTIAL OF REUSE FROM RAINWATER HARVESTING\nof greywater, supporting its widespread adoption in public and private buildings, whether old or new.\nRio de Janeiro must be better prepared to face water crises, by dealing with the challenge of pollution and access to sanitation in a structured manner The strategy should support existing programs such as the Reforestation, Urban Tree Coverage, and Rainwater Drainage. This initiative is at the planning stage, stimulated by Rio Resiliente, and was partially adopted by Strategic Plan 2017-2020, which includes studies for identification of capturing new water sources in the city.\nRIO VISION 500\nAspiration 1: Rio will have water security having mapped all risks with their strategic action plans; Aspiration 2: Rio will work within a network of cities in order to promote basic sanitation to the whole metro region; Aspiration 3: The population will not waste usable water and its reuse will be part of people\u2019s routine.\nSTRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020\nInitiative 3.05 - Proper use of water resources with guidelines to reduce water vulnerability aiming to balance its supply and demand; Initiative 3.06 - Better quality of water bodies helping increase the extension beaches which are\nproper for bathing.\nVALUE AND CO-BENEFITS\nLess dependency on a single source and better security for the water supply; more resilient and sustainable use of water resources; mitigation of impacts as droughts and flooding; mitigation of water-borne illnesses.\nINDICATORS\nImprovement in the water quality of rivers and lakes; better water safety in the beaches and in Guanabara Bay; number of installed rainwater capture systems and volume of greywater reused; increase in the micro-production of water in the city - less dependency on the Guandu system.\nFOCAL POINTS\nRio Resiliente and water management departments, both city and state.\nPOTENTIAL PARTNERS\nCl, WRI, The Nature Conservancy, CEDAE, FOZ Aguas.\nRESILIENCE QUALITIES\nRESILIENCE CHAMPION\nPaulo Fonseca Civil Engineer, Paulo has worked with Rio Resiliente developing the water strategy of Rio.

He holds a PhD degree in Civil Engineering and is a member of the City Leadership Group, a team of public servants specially trained for management positions. .\nINITIATIVE #4.B:\nImplement Solar Energy Strategy\nDESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE\nPromote decentralized generation of solar energy in the city, developing an urban solar energy strategy and starting its implementation on buildings owned by the municipality.\nRio de Janeiro receives sufficient yearly solar irradiation on its available rooftops to power 183% of the energy needed by its residents. Besides, solar energy is equitably available to every citizen throughout the four seasons, and therefore solar energy can promote equal access to this basic service. Furthermore, in Brazil, the generation of electricity is becoming less sustainable in the latest years, due to the intense use of thermal plants (up to 25% of the matrix in 2015). This has had a negative effect in the price of energy and the purchasing power of citizens. This trend is opposed to the vision of the municipality and its citizens, as indicated in the Vision Rio 500, which envisions a low carbon future for the city.\nThe development of a solar strategy should begin in smaller pilot projects inside city administration. For this reason, a Solar Energy and Energy Efficiency project was initiated in the Center of Operations Rio, to be implemented after the Olympics. Considering the lessons learned in this project, it is possible to develop a wider implementation plan that incorporates large-scale cases from other cities, including innovative finance solutions\nThe strategy for solar energy was proposed by Rio Resiliente and RioAguas was incorporated in the Strategic Plan 2017-2020 in two different contexts: development of a strategy in 2018 and support to sustainable buildings.\nRIO VISION 500\nAspiration 1: The City will ensure a low-carbon energy matrix; Aspiration 2: All regions of the city will have access to high quality public infrastructure; Aspiration 2: All new buildings will follow ecoefficiency guidelines and existing\nones will be encouraged towards modernization; Aspiration 3: The city will remain as the national capital for the energy industry, attracting high value-added activities and fostering renewable energy sources.\nSTRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020\nInitiative 3.08 - Incentive programs for sustainable constructions in the city of Rio; Initiative 5.01 - Structuring of an area to coordinate economic growth actions and sectorial development new tools.\nVALUE AND CO-BENEFITS\nReduction in the consumption of energy and, in Brazil, due to the energy matrix, mostly hydroelectric, also water; lower risk in case of water or energy scarcity; lower carbon emissions, economic development - diversification and development of a more sustainable economy.\nINDICATORS\nTotal KW installed in municipal buildings; amount of MWh produced by decentralized solar energy; total investment in solar energy yearly in municipal buildings, GHG emissions avoided in the generation and use of electricity.\nFOCAL POINTS\nCOR and Rio Resiliente, Casa do Futuro, Solarize, Light.\nPOTENTIAL PARTNERS\nPENSA, EMZINGO, USC.\nFUNDING\nFor solar energy in the Center of Operations Rio (COR): BRL 305,100, in which BRL 267,900 is from the Energy Efficiency program of the National Agency for Electric Energy (ANEEL), and BRL 37,200 from COR\nand Rio Resiliente.

Born Dutch and currently a Carioca, si le is an expert in energy and water and leads Rio Resiliente\u2019s initiatives in these themes, including the project to install solar energy in the Center of Operations Rio (Initiative 4.B) and the calculation of the potential energy and water efficiency, and solar energy, in the municipal schools of Rio (Initiative 4.C). \u201cIt is an Ilonor to be part of Rio Resiliente and strive together so tllat my adoptive city will be even more marvelous, resilient and sustainable through the promotion of solar energy\u201d.\nINITIATIVE #4.C:\nRealize Energy and Water Efficiency in Public Buildings\nDESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE\nRealize energy and water efficiency in public buildings, with the potential to zero the energy bill of the municipality, implemented in tandem with initiative 4.B, Solar Energy.\nDue to water scarcity in the beginning of 2015, decree n\u00b0 39848 of 2015 establishes that City departments must keep the same electricity budget as in the previous year, 2014, despite the rising prices of energy. In order to meet that goal, it is essential to investigate the true potential for lower consumption of water and energy. For this reason, Rio Resiliente sought to start this investigation through a department with the highest possible impact, from a technical standpoint but also for co-benefits of education and behavior. Therefore, a study was carried out to calculate the reduction potential in more than 1450 school units in the municipality, the largest school network in Latin America.\nIn total, schools in Rio use approximately 80GWh of electricity and 4 million m3 of water per year (reference 2015). The study, which included sight visits to a sample of schools, identified a potential reduction of 39% (31GWh) for electricity and 58% reduction (2,4 million m3) for water. The potential for solar energy in rooftops was also calculated to be able generate 101 GWh\/year, sufficient to cover all needs. This represents potential savings of BRL 122 million per year, more than the actual costs: in fact, the electricity bills could be zeroed and still generate income for expansion in the number of schools.\nThe analysis for the potential of water and energy efficiency in schools was carried out with technical and financial support of the World Bank. Considering the different typologies of buildings and distinct use, new diagnosis for hospital and other public buildings are necessary. The project was initiated by Rio Resiliente, in partnership with the Secretary of Education and Pensa Saia de Ideias, and provides support for the meeting of the energy efficiency goals stated in the Strategic\nPlan 2017-2020.\nRIO VISION 500\nAspiration (III. 1 .a) The City will ensure a low-carbon energy matrix; Aspiration (IV.2.c): All regions of the city will have access to high quality public infrastructure; Aspiration (lll.l.b) All new buildings will follow ecoefficiency guidelines and existing ones will be encouraged towards modernization; Aspiration (V.1 ,e) The city will remain as the national capital for the energy industries, attracting high value adding activities and fostering renewable energy sources.\nSTRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020\nInitiative 3.08: Incentive programs for sustainable constructions in the city of Rio; Initiative 5.01: Structuring of an area to coordinate economic growth actions and sectorial development new tools.\nVALUE AND CO-BENEFITS\nReduction in the use of water and energy; lower risk of supply shocks; lowers carbon emissions; economic development: diversification and development of a more sustainable economy; education of children about sustainable use of natural resources, among others.\nINDICATORS\nReduction in the consumption of water and energy in public buildings: education, health and others; number of buildings in the municipality with water and energy programs; total investment per year on water and energy efficiency.\nFOCAL POINTS\nRio Resiliente and PENSA.\nPOTENTIAL PARTNERS\nWorld Bank, Accenture, Secretary of Education and other city departments such as health, finance and public works.\nINITIATIVE #4.D:\nUniversal Access to Sanitation\nIn order to expand the sewage system to reach 80% of the population in the municipality, this initiative proposes to implement sanitation systems in Barra daTijuca, Jacarepagua and the West zone, ensure compliance with the targets of existing concessions in the West zone and track the expansion of sanitation to the center, South and North areas.\nAspiration (III.3.b): Rio will work in a networked manner to universalize sanitation in the city and the metropolitan area, depolluting water bodies in the region; Aspiration (III,4.b): The city\u2019s green area will be protected and expanded, and the culture of environmental preservation will be an asset.\nImproved management of water resources of the city by eliminating the exposure of the population and ecosystems to pollution.

On the one hand there is more demand for primary products, with the increased of extraction and associated environmental impacts; on the other hand there is a growing generation of residue, which create problems for transportation and disposal. The circular economy proposes that products should be developed already considering the extension of its lifetime, reuse, recycling, upcycling and transformation.\nLarge cities are, in fact, businesses ecosystems which can act in an integrated manner, so that the waste generated by one industry may become a primary product for another. The recycling and transformation of products has the enormous potential to create jobs related to the reuse of products at artisanal and industrial scales but also for the creative economy.\nThe jobs created have the potential to insert in the formal economy low-skilled workers and create opportunities for those in the fields of engineering, chemistry and product design. For example, currently exists a nearly 100% collection and recycling of aluminum cans and this happens because there are economically viable industrial processes that allow this closed circuit. One of the objectives of the Agency is to understand the dynamics of the local industries, identify opportunities in the world market for commodities, connect parts and promote new means for the reuse of materials.\nThe diversification of the Rio\u2019s economy is one of the ways to become more resilient to economic shocks of all kinds.\nThe Agency for the Promotion of Circular Economy will act to:\n-\tidentify opportunities and new businesses in the industries related to the reuse of waste and materials;\n-\tpromote the reuse of organic waste, by large generators, such as hotels, supermarkets and tree pruning; but also by residents,\nthrough composting;\n- promote entrepreneurship through reuse, recycling, upcycling and transformation, connecting the many existing initiatives spread around the city, to reach economy of scale.\nCurrently, selective street collection is eight times more expensive than general street collection. International experiences demonstrate, however, that this cost can be minimized or totally covered by the resale of residue at market prices. There are also solutions in which the citizens are part of the collection chain, that is, actively return materials used in a distributed form. For this reason, it is necessary to identify the barriers that impede sectors to become more resilient, lucrative and sustainable, and act to connect the different needs, pointing outvalue generation opportunities.\nOrganic waste comprises 32% of all waste in Rio de Janeiro and is sent primarily to a landfill in the neighboring city of Seropedica. In landfills, organic matter releases methane gas in its decomposition, which is highly pollutant. However; the product of composting, which could be processed inside residences, in public squares, or in large scale, can generate fertilizers to urban gardens and agricultural production inside the city, minimizing costs and emissions from food transport and creating jobs.\nThis is an initiative proposed by Rio Resiliente and is in its planning stage.\nRIO VISION 500\nAspiration (111.1 ,c) All residential waste will be minimized, reused, transformed and converted into energy; Aspiration (III.4.C) Local and state food production will be fostered, increasing people access to a healthy diet; Aspiration (V1 .a) The city will be an important knowledge hub where research and innovation will attract high value-added partners; Aspiration (V.1 ,b) Rio will be an international hub for creative economy; Aspiration (V1.c) Rio will be the main tourism, business and social center of Latin America; Aspiration (V2.c) Unregulated labor reduced will be drastically, guaranteeing workers\u2019 rights and increasing productivity; Aspiration (V.3.b) Rio will have the best entrepreneurship ecosystem of Latin America; Aspiration (VI. 1 .a): The city will be recognized for its quality on planning, execution, maintenance and controls systems coordination.\nSTRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020\nInitiative 3.03: Strengthen the agroecology production of Rio, preferably in areas with poor potential for urbanization; Initiative 5.01: Structuring of an area to coordinate economic growth actions and sectorial development new tools; Initiative 5.02: Development of Rio Cidade Criativa program aiming to boost the creative industry of the city; Initiative 5.04: Businesses scenario improvement in order to get both a better impression from entrepreneurs and investors and a higher position on Doing Business ranking; Initiative 6.01: Keep City Hall\u2019s investment grade.\nVALUE AND CO-BENEFITS\nSupports connection between stakeholders for common goals; promotes a more resilient economy, more diversified and inclusive; supports entrepreneurship.\nINDICATORS\nVolume of business created from the sale of residue, number of direct and indirect jobs created.\nRESILIENCE QUALITIES\nFOCAL POINTS\nRio Resiliente and departments for economic development.\nPOTENTIAL PARTNERS\nPacto do Rio, Rio Negocios, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, ReciclApao, Rio + B, universities.\nRESILIENCE CHAMPIONS\nLuisa Santiago was part of Rio Resiiente in its beginning in 2014, as consultant and strategy partner of the CRO in project management and in the relationship with 100 Resilient Cites.

Those minicenters, either public or private, will be meeting points for actions for the valorization of solid and organic waste, and can be the end point for formal and informal transactions via cell phone apps. Actions should involve the composting of organic residue for the use of residents and distribution for urban gardening and local agriculture, and can involve many techniques of composting, in various scales. Besides, those minicenters must promote opportunities to increase the useful life of materials, through reuse and exchange. Therefore, it is possible to achieve not only valorization of what otherwise would become waste and sent to landfill, but also prevent its generation in the first place, and thus incentivize a culture of consumption that is less wasteful and more circular.\nThe initiative involves the engagement of many stakeholders, such as residents and business owners, and also the professionalization of workers already occupied with the collection of recyclable products.\nRIO VISION 500\nAspiration (111.1 ,c) All residential waste will be minimized, reused, transformed and converted into energy; Aspiration (111.4. c) A Local and state food production will be fostered, increasing people access to a healthy diet; (V.3.b) Rio will be the main tourism, business and sociability center of Latin America; Aspiration (V.2.c) Unregulated labor will reduce drastically, guaranteeing workers\u2019rights and increasing productivity; Aspiration (VI.1.a): The city will be recognized for its quality on planning, execution,\nmaintenance and controls systems coordination.\nSTRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020\nInitiative 3.03: Strengthen the agroecology production of Rio, preferably, in areas with poor potential for urbanization; Initiative 5.04: Businesses scenario improvement in order to get both a better impression from entrepreneurs and investors and a higher position on Doing Business ranking; Initiative 6.06: Engage PPPs and other external resources to address high priority issues of the city.\nVALUE AND CO-BENEFITS\nThe project addresses the livelihood of people in condition of social vulnerability; accumulation of residues in slopes, streets and rivers; and also shocks to the food supply.

Citizens are more or less resilient in relation to their social context - it is known that vulnerable populations are always more susceptible to shocks of all kinds, and they also take longer to recover. Unequal access to basic services such as sanitation, water and health also increases exposure to various risks.\nThe resilience of an individual, as well as of its community, also varies depending on the vulnerabilities specific to their living or working spaces, denominated contextual resilience. For example, some people live in areas more susceptible to risks, such as landslides, river flooding, sea level rise, among others.\nThe third level of analysis is individual resilience, related to knowledge about risks, disaster preparedness and personal habits, such as eliminating mosquito breeding grounds, or keep at home emergency items, like water, batteries, lanterns, among other items specific to their context.\nThe scientific literature about crisis and resilience, the basis for the development of the indicators, indicates that a culture of prevention and enhanced knowledge about risks in the everyday life, make citizens more resilient to all kinds of shocks and increases the effectiveness of public policies.\nThe Individual Resilience Indicators were developed by WRI Brasil\/Cidades Sustentaveis in collaboration with Rio Resiliente in 2015, with the input and support of City managers, especially Civil Defense, Instituto Pereira Passos and PENSA,\nalong with the hosting of several workshops with the civil society (academia, NGOs). Many cities around the world have already demonstrated the interest to adopt the indicators, with adaptations related to their specific resilience challenges.\nThe indicators will be applied in Rio de Janeiro in three different ways: citywide, with the support of research institutes, for an overview of the individual resilience of citizens; inside city schools, before and after the course on Urban Resilience (initiative 1 .A), to assess knowledge acquisition at practical level; and at community level, for the identification of strong and weak aspects, and eventual adjustment of public policies.\nThe application of the Individual Resilience Indicators was proposed by Rio Resiliente and adopted by the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, with goals, milestones and budget. This initiative aims to measure knowledge about vulnerabilities and preparedness to disasters, and therefore tackles all the shocks and stresses of the city.\nRIO VISION 500\nAspiration (lll.3.b): The city will be ready and adapted to face climate change and its impacts, having mapped and planned for its main threats; Aspiration (VI.1 .a): The city will be recognized for its quality on planning, execution, maintenance and controls systems coordination; Aspiration (VI.1 ,b): Best practices management with processes that are efficient, non-bureaucratic, suited to local needs, digitalized and constantly monitored.\nSTRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020\nInitiative 6.03: Development of high-performance management system; Initiative 6.07: Structuring of a citizen engagement policy; Initiative 6.10: Management strategy maximizing the efficiency of urban planning city agents and improving information, control and monitoring systems.

Medellin is an innovative, inclusive and forward-thinking city. However, all this has only been possible because of our capacity to overcome the obstacles that we have faced over time.\n\"Medellin\" is set in a valley surrounded by steep mountains, so settling there was and continues to be a fairly complicated task. After it was founded, here was a long period of violence, and we lived in fear. However, even in the darkest days, we never stopped believing in our city. It was thanks to the communities' commitment that we managed to progress. The citizens embraced Medellin and transformed it.\nNow we know that we have come a long way, but that there is still a lot to do. We want a safe, equitable and sustainable city, and to achieve this, we are working on a public management model based on citizen trust. If we can trust in others, in society and in the State, we can say that Medellin works, because everyone does their part and receives what they deserve.\nTo build the city that we dream of and that we believe in, we have always worked as a team with companies, universities, and other organizations who all contribute to the task. One of our great partners has undoubtedly been the Resilience Office. With the support of this great network of 100 Resilient Cities Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, we have included the concept of resilience in our development plan as an innovative approach that views the city's exposure to risks and vulnerabilities and transforms them into opportunities that will be the driving force of new progress.\nJust like life, the city is built by looking to the future. We may fall, but we always have to get back up again. When we doubt whether it is worth it, we need to look back for a moment, which will give us the confidence that if we have come this far, we can go much further.\nMEDELLIN A GREAT EXAMPLE\nOF RESILIENCE\n100 Resilient Cities is extremely pleased to continue our partnership with Medellin, a city leading the way in urban transformation and resilience for Latin America and the world. As we celebrate the release of the city's Resilience Strategy, Medellin steps forward once again. This strategy exemplifies the holistic and award-winning thinking that Medellin has become known for globally.\nThis strategy would not have been possible without the support and leadership of Mayor\nGutierrez, who has embraced the resilience agenda. Mayor Gutierrez and his team have shown a commitment to the far-reaching efforts of this strategy to bring resilience to every corner of\nMedellin. We must extend additional thanks to the city's Chief Resilience Officer, Santiago Uribe, and his team, including Laura Acevedo, Knowledge Manager, and Oscar Cardona, Manager of Communications, who helped to lay the foundation for this inspiring Resilience Strategy.\nMedellin has gone through a remarkable transformation, but remains dedicated to learning from and exchanging with the world as the city continues to innovate at home - neighborhood by neighborhood. This strategy is a testament to that dedication. The Medellin resilience team, the Mayor's office, the City Council, and the comunasthemselves have contributed to a highly integrated resilience strategy that is also reflective of the larger changes in the city. That includes a set of initiatives that have influenced the newly released city's development plan (2016-2019) and vice versa, creating a dynamic set of strategic actions that reinforce one another to build holistic resilience throughout Medellin.\nThis Resilience Strategy's four goals and related initiatives represent the resilience agenda in all its breadth and depth- from youth participation in science, technology, and innovation at a neighborhood level to developing a comprehensive risk reduction and public education plan for disaster; from strengthening the livelihoods and lifestyles of women and girls to revitalizing the river through economic, cultural, environmental, and social means. As such, this strategy strengthens the overall resilience of the city to withstand the shocks and stresses that will likely still occur. Medellin has enhanced its ability to plan, prevent, respond and prosper, built on a foundation two years' in the making - through research and stakeholder engagement across the city and region.\nBut the release of this strategy does not represent the finish line. It is another important step for the city of Medellin, and Colombia as a whole, to pivot to a new, vibrant, and peaceful future.\nWe were pleased to be on hand when Medellin was honored at the 2016 World Cities Summit in Singapore with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize - a true acknowledgement of the innovation this city has spurred in the past few decades. We look forward to the many successes and innovations ahead in Medellin, building upon the work recognized by this prestigious award and contained within the city's Resilience Strategy.\nSincerely,\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOften known for its dark and stormy past, Medellin has risen like a phoenix from its own ashes to become a global example of urban and social transformation today.\nAlmost three decades ago, no one would have thought that Medellin would have managed to leave behind its violent past to become a city where innovation and people's dreams flourish, thanks to the collective work of its citizens, leaders, and public and private institutions.\nHowever, our city's present and future face enormous challenges. Unfortunately, the inequality, social conflict, insecurity, intolerance, inadequate land management, and new environmental challenges related to climate change endanger what we have worked so hard to achieve.\nRecognizing the importance of building on existing models and visions of the city, in coordination with 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, and with the support of strategic partners, the Resilience Office has brought together the knowledge and experience of multiple strategic planning exercises and efforts carried out in the city in recent decades. These exercises have compiled the different voices of citizens committed to their city; experts passionate about awareness of the city's problems; leaders who dream of a better future; and relentless workers who have made and continue to make Medellin a true expression of resilience.\nResilient Medellin resulted from a collaborative process and strategic thinking about the city's future from a modern and innovative perspective. Collectively we have sought to understand the interrelations between the\nshocks and stresses facing the city to convert these risks into challenges, and a driving force for change.\nOur strategy's approach is structured around four ambitious goals supported by actions that will achieve our vision of a Resilient Medellin:\nEquitable Medellin\nTo achieve the dream of an equitable city, we need to strengthen and create new strategies for educating citizens that will facilitate access to new opportunities tailored to the needs of different city contexts.\nThe actions in this document start by recognizing diversity and inclusion, so that people are part of the transformation of the city.\nWe establish the goal of an Equitable Medellin with the intention of creating educational and training projects, to develop and improve citizens' life skills, and their psychosocial and emotional capacity, especially of the city's young people.\nThe creation of new jobs and enterprises, will be nurtured through the promotion of culture, recreation and sports, and through art, science and technology education, creating a more resilient people.\nSafe and Peaceful Medellin\nTo achieve the dream of a safe and peaceful city, we will focus on preventing crime, creating strategies that permit access to justice, comprehensive care of victims, and remembrance.\nTo transform the city and achieve a safe and peaceful Medellin, we also need to raise people's awareness of what transpired in the past to prevent the cycle of violence and insecurity repeating in the future. Knowing fully the history of what happened will help people understand how not to repeat the events that led to acts of violence.\nSustainable and\nRisk-Prepared Medellin\nWe need to find the best way to mitigate economic losses and adverse effects caused by natural and human made disasters. We can achieve this through strategies that incorporate restrictions on land use control to address the threats and comply with city planning restrictions.\nMedellin needs to identify the barriers that exist in the implementation of land management regulations, strengthen community participation in disaster risk management, and promote the revision, update and implementation of the building codes, primarily in schools, health centers and housing.\nWe also consider it a priority to promote accessibility, circulation, integration and coordination of the city's public transportation systems to ensure the safe movement of people and goods over land.\nWell-informed and Engaged Medellin\nThrough using data based decision-making practices, we can identify coordinated, holistic solutions to priority issues. It will be important to have a system or an agency that is responsible for data integration to allow the city to respond to problems more efficiently and with greater benefits for the population.\nPhotography: Archivo Departamento Administrative de Planeacion - Alcaldia de Medellin\nThese goals form a plan of convergent actions that bring together a large number of projects (existing and new) The plan provides a shared understanding of the meaning and value of resilience, such as strengthening human and social ability to overcome adversity. Our city has developed the capacity to think, reinvent itself, and find original ways of living in the world. Medellin is a city that resists shocks, trauma, pain and loss, which has allowed it to find different ways of overcoming difficulties, disasters, tragedies and abuses. We are a valley, a mountain, a river, a hillside, a people. We are a resilient city.\nFor most people, resilience is a new and foreign word that is even difficult to pronounce, which few of us associate with the history of the city, its institutions or its people. However, since the recognition by the Rockefeller Foundation including Medellin as a member of 100 Resilient Cities, the word resilience is frequently used when talking about the city's urban and social transformation.\nFor Medellin, \"resilience is part of the capacity that the city (as an urban, social and political system) and its inhabitants have developed to resist, overcome and learn from the causes and effects of national violence. This has been on-going for more than 60 years, particularly urban violence, which was most extreme in the nineties, intensified by the drug trafficking business, and since then, it has transformed into multiple expressions of violence.\"\nThe city was chosen to join the 100 Resilient City program because of the innovative way it choses to identify the main risks to which its people and institutions are exposed. More than just an award or acknowledgment, it provides a great opportunity to recognize our problems and difficulties to help overcome them.\nThis was the first challenge that the recently created Medellin Resilience Office assumed - to prepare a preliminary resilience assessment (PRA). The PRA facilitated the identification of the priority areas on which we should work together to promote the wellbeing and development of our city, and to improve its resilience capacity. It is a tool for strategic planning to reduce the impact of the shocks and stresses that afflict us the most.\nThis self-assessment exercise was carried out with the support of countless institutions and work groups, including the High Commissioner for Peace,\nReconciliation and Life, the Victims' Care Unit, Casa de la Memoria Museum,\nProantioquia, Urbam, and Parque Explora. As part of the PRA, priority stresses were identified and interdependencies between them were highlighted related to the phenomena of violence and conflict, such as: inequality; illegality; access to justice for citizens; access to good quality education, especially higher education, which particularly generates opportunities for the young population; and better land and risk management.\nThis self-assessment exercise provided basic information to the Resilience Office to develop the resilience strategy, which we hope will allow us to nurture relationships with local and international strategic partners, and to better understand the city's problems while proposing solutions for them.\nMedellin's Main Resilience Challenges\nWe are a proud and profound expression of resilience. Medellin is a diverse, dynamic and expanding city that is constantly reinventing itself amidst social and economic difficulties. We have always embraced adversity as opportunity. Today, we continue to face a set of interrelated challenges of inequity, violence, illegality and extreme poverty that are exacerbated by our complex topography of steep slopes and narrow valleys.\nOur biggest challenges are to overcome problems associated with inequity, such as widespread rural-to-urban migration, poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, limited access to higher education and economic opportunity, which have been intensified by a culture of illegality inherited from many years of violence.\nThe deterioration of public safety reinforced by social marginalization, organized crime, illegality, and conflicts between citizens due to a culture of intolerance, destabilize and endanger the positive achievements implemented during Medellin's transformation over the last decades. Our city must overcome these obstacles to continue our social development agenda and ensure respect for the human rights of all its citizens.\nContinued threats related to the management of the land and natural resources reduce Medellin s ability to operate and provide basic services to people, leading to health problems, loss of life, and damage to infrastructure and the environment, particularly affecting the most vulnerable population. Such threats are perpetuated by both natural and man-made shocks and stresses preventing us from achieving the sustainability goals.\nDecision-making without reliable information and data limits the city's ability to respond in a strategic and coordinated manner to shocks and stresses.\nAlthough Medellin has several information systems, it lacks a unified structure to identify vulnerabilities, lessening the ability to reduce risk and monitor response and recovery. We strive to inform our citizens with the most reliable information in seamlessly integrated, easily accessible sources for each citizen.\nMedellin's Resilience Vision\nWe envision a city where resilience is ubiquitous in our strategic planning processes as the driving force of urban transformation and social innovation, where we continue to promote equity and a culture of legality, improve urban land management, and reduce violence and extreme poverty.\n100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation defines resilience as \"the capacity of individuals, communities and systems to withstand shocks while still maintaining their essential functions. Resilience also refers to the ability to recover quickly and effectively from catastrophes and the capability to endure greater stress.\nBuilding resilience is about making people, communities and systems better prepared to withstand catastrophic events - both natural and manmade - and able to bounce back more quickly and emerge stronger from these shocks and stresses. Humans are not born with resilience - we learn it, adapt it, and improve upon it. The same is true for organizations, systems, and societies.\"\nAs part of the Resilient Medellin Challenge, we propose developing specific actions contained in the following\ngoals:\nEquitable Medellin\nDevelop a more equitable and inclusive city and region with access to opportunities for all our citizens.\nSafe and Peaceful Medellin\nStrengthen a more peaceful and socially cohesive society by promoting crime and violence prevention strategies and a culture of legality.\nSustainable and Risk-Prepared\nMedellin\nCreate a sustainable and risk-prepared city through greater management of land and infrastructure, sustainable transportation, environmental planning and adequate management of the natural resources and quality of life for its citizens.\nWell-Informed and Engaged\nMedellin\nFoster a well-informed city through improved access to information and data management that facilitates the analysis and transfer of knowledge for strategic planning of the city and effective governance.\nResilience Dividends\nThrough our goals and initiatives, we seek to generate multiple benefits through \"resilience dividends\". \"Resilience dividends\" are about minimizing the effects of long-term shocks and stresses on individuals, families and communities, as well as maximizing the multiple benefits accrued from investment in resilient people, structures and systems within communities for the future. Throughout the Resilient Medellin Strategy, there will be co-benefits that spread across initiatives and goals to make a safer, stronger and more equitable Medellin. We highlight the \"resilience dividends\" in our four flagship initiatives, one per resilience strategy goal, as examples of the multiplier effect that investing in resilience generates for cities.\n\"We are building more than a network - we are building a movement. Cities learning from cities. Sectors innovating with other sectors. \"\nDr. Judith Rodin\nPresident, The Rockefeller Foundation\nPurpose rjrjcJ JrrjpJsrrjsniordorj of ins PsslJJsncs SircJiscjy\nPhotography: Oscar Cardona Alvarez\nIhe city has contemplated its resilience capacity in order to improve its citizens' quality of life, reduce threats, create a safer place for living, and improve its economic development.\nThe Resilience Strategy is focused on a group of flagship initiatives that must be collectively developed by the city's different organizations to mitigate the impact of the threats and to build a sustainable and resilient city.\nTo create this document, the knowledge, ideas and experience of national and international, public, private and civil organizations were collected, gradually establishing actions for Medellin to improve its resilience capacity.\nFurthermore, the chronic stresses and critical shocks of the city were researched through the review of documents, workshops, interviews and meetings with diverse organizations and people interested in knowing how the city has overcome its adversities, and the lessons that it has learned to create new strategies and empower existing ones, which gives the city greater sustainability.\nThe actions described below in each goal are the result of the arduous work and effort of public and private institutions, and of the many people who dream of a resilient Medellin.\n100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not only the shocks -earthquakes, floods, outbreaks of disease, etc.- but also the stresses that weaken a city's structure on a day to day or cyclical basis. Examples of these stresses include high unemployment; an overtaxed or inefficient public transportation system; endemic violence; or chronic food and water shortages. By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.\n[...] 100RC aims not only to help individual cities become more resilient, but will facilitate the building of a global practice of resilience...\nMedellin was one of the first cities to be selected to form part of the 100 Resilient Cities Challenge. Unlike others that focused their attention on the capacity to overcome natural disasters or the value of disaster risk management, Medellin focused its proposal on assuming resilience, such as:\n\"the capacity that the city (as an urban, social and political system) and its inhabitants have developed to resist, overcome and learn from the causes and effects of national violence. This has been experienced for more than 60 years, particularly urban violence, which underwent its most difficult times in the nineties, intensified by the drug trafficking business, and since then, it has transformed into multiple expressions of violence.\u201d\n(City's application nomination form)\nOne of our main guiding principles for the design of the Resilience Strategy has been the Resilience Framework developed by Arup with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation for the 100 Resilient Cities Challenge. With this tool, we identified the most critical areas of Medellin, where actions need to be implemented to strengthen the city's resilience capacity.\nIn the process of identifying resilient actions, the resilience qualities also designed by ARUP were taken into account, which allow cities as urban systems to support, respond to and adapt to the shocks and stresses as quickly as possible. Therefore, projects were sought that were:\nREFLECTIVE\nIndividuals and institutions that are reflective use past experience to inform future decisions, and will modify standards\nand behaviors accordingly.\nRESOURCEFUL\nPeople and institutions are able to recognize alternative ways to use resources at times of crisis in order to meet their needs or achieve\ntheir goals.\nROBUST\nWell-conceived, constructed and managed systems.\nThis includes making the provision to ensure that failure is predictable, safe,\nand not\ndisproportionate to the cause.\nEXTRA\nCAPACITY\nRefers to spare capacity intentionally created to accommodate disruption due to extreme pressures, surges in demand or an external event. It includes diversity where there are multiple ways to achieve a given need.\nFLEXIBILITY\nRefers to the willingness and capacity to adopt alternative strategies in response to changing circumstances or sudden crises. Systems can be made more flexible by introducing new technologies or knowledge, including recognizing traditional practices.\nINCLUSIVE\nPrioritizes the need for broad consultation and'many seats at the table\u2019to create a sense of shared ownership in decision-making.\nINTEGRATED\nProcesses that bring together a wide range of different systems and institutions, and\nthat can catalyze additional benefits as resources are shared, and participants are\nenabled to work together to achieve greater aims.\nThe capacity to learn from the past and act in times of crisis.\nAre qualities that help to conceive systems and assets that can withstand shocks and stresses, as well as the willingness to use alternative strategies to facilitate rapid recovery.\nRelate to the processes of good governance and effective leadership that ensure investments and actions are appropriate, address the needs of the most vulnerable, and collectively create a resilient city - for everyone.\nBy prioritizing the initiatives using the resilience qualities, the city will be able to identify strategies that intervene in multiple shocks and stresses in a more focused manner, preventing the development of other crises and intervening in existent ones. This improves the city's recovery capacity, saves financial and human resources, and contributes to the construction of a more equitable and sustainable city.\n\"Resilience is Medellin. I believe that we are a very beautiful and profound expression of resilience, because I understand that resilience is what makes a society able to confront its difficulties and its challenges, its infeasibilities and its conflicts, its insecurities, and in general, all its difficult situations with collective capacity and energy to transform this into a strength. This is a city that has lived though so many disgraces and so many pains, but that every day dreams of a better world and works to overcome them.\nThis land is ours and we don't doubt for a second that it is our responsibility to make it better. \"\nJorge Perez Jaramillo - FORMER PLANNING SECRETARY OF MEDELLIN.\nFOTO\nPlatform Partners\nBy being part of The 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, the city has access to an innovative platform of partners that offers a series of services to support the Resilience Strategy in its development and implementation.\nThe platform partners are from the private and public sectors and from civil society, and they offer tools in areas such as financial innovation, technology, infrastructure, land use, and social and community resilience.\nTogether with the city's public and private institutions, the Medellin Resilience Office is working with some platform partners on specific actions to be developed as part of the actions that are described as part of each goal of the Resilience Strategy. The platform partners we are working with are:\nCOORDINATION OF THE RESILIENCE OFFICE WITH THE CITY'S DEVELOPMENT PLAN\nIn its 2016-2019 Development Plan, Medellin has established the cross-cutting resilience approach in its seven guiding principals with which it intends to recover citizen coexistence and safety; develop a new model of social equality; implement high quality educational programs for development and competitiveness; work for sustainable mobility; comprehensively intervene in the land and recover the center as an area for living; implement environmental conservation programs; and work on citizen culture.\nUnder the leadership of the Resilience Office and with the support of the 100 Resilient Cities Program, the city defined and assumed resilience in its 2016-2019 Development Plan as the \"capacity for strategic planning that permits the identification and design of comprehensive solutions from multiple aspects, such as security and coexistence, social cohesion, citizen culture, sustainable mobility, education, risk management, land management, information management, and sustainability\". This assumes the challenge to increase the capacity of the city to overcome difficulties and maintain the actions directed at improving the environment and people's quality of life.\nThe Medellin Resilience Office is one of the main offices in the city responsible for embedding resilience in for the programs and projects of the Development Plan.\nThe role of the Chief Resilience Officer and his team of professionals is to work with public, private and social organizations to identify the city's vulnerabilities, establish proposals that permit the reduction of risks, and monitor their delivery with coordinated, shared and reliable information. The office has established itself as having the capacity for coordination, assistance, follow-up and assessment of the selected projects, actions, plans and programs of institutions and civil society to empower Medellin's capacity for strategic planning. It helps the city to generate other social innovations and urban transformations, strengthening equality, a culture of legality, land management, reduction of violence and extreme poverty.\nThere are many definitions of equality, perhaps the most successful one is that by Amartya Sen, who links equality with the opportunities that allow human beings to develop their potential and access the benefits of development in order to achieve a dignified life. It is known that worldwide, inequality is currently the greatest political problem (it generates instability and weakens the State's institutions), social problem (a society in which there are great economic, political and social differences is divided, and frequently in conflict), and moral problem (as inequality obstructs visibility and the exercise of human dignity based on the moral subject). And it is not just a problem of poor nations; rich nations have also seen inequality grow given the enormous concentration of wealth in the hands of few people.\nInequality can be seen in the exclusion of large sectors of the population because of their lack of capacity to play a productive role in society. Exclusive societies, meaning those that do not promote or permit the participation of their whole population in political circles (full participation in citizens' rights), economic life (production, access to and enjoyment of the available wealth) and social circles (access to services that make good quality of life possible: education, health, housing, recreation, and art), are unequal societies in which the shortages and inequalities not only have material consequences, but also, and perhaps most importantly, psychological consequences (insecurity, pessimism and fear) and moral problems (distrust, despair and humiliation).\nIn light of this very negative outlook for human dignity, and the suffering as a result of exclusion and inequality, the possibility is considered of human beings overcoming their circumstances and conditions, to readjust their psyche and recover their moral strength. This is thanks to resilience, which is a condition of human beings that helps them to overcome their limitations and obstacles\nproduced by social disorder and face their psychological, economic, social and moral situation with possibilities of success. Children and young people have the greatest resilience capacity, but all human beings can awaken it and make it into an effective medium to progress toward their development if they receive support. It is practically impossible to escape from a situation of severe marginality if there are not certain conditions that facilitate it. This is very important.\nContributing to the recovery process of human beings subjected to conditions of extreme vulnerability and suffering is not an easy task and it must be overcome with a dual approach. Materially, because in the event of extreme shortages, there is a need to resort to benefits, and psychologically, because the lost trust needs to be reignited in others, and above all, in oneself. Here is where practices of equality arise as a first breath that awakens resilience, and shows whether there are the people and resources to achieve it with, whether it is possible to progress on their own feet and whether rehumanization of their existence is achievable.\nIn response to complete or almost complete deprivation, many human beings have the wonderful capacity to reinvent themselves, recompose themselves, and even to survive, and they can do it all by themselves. The capacity is there, but it needs to be awakened and supported. Equality and one of its most important categories, positive discrimination, is the magic word that will awaken it. Affection and assistance (which are determining factors in children to trigger these processes), and material support are necessary. The supported resilience of social, political and moral practices of equality will allow a large number of human beings that are currently marginalized to become the authors of their own inclusion in society, which they currently see from the margins of poverty and abandonment.\nOver the last two years, the Medellin Resilience Office reviewed and studied different initiatives and projects that were being implemented in the city, and other new ones that had been proposed. After this review process, we consider that the actions proposed to achieve an equitable Medellin are the ones described below.\nFlagship Initiative\nl.A Colaboratorios - Public\nExperimentation Workshop\nA Colaboratorio is a citizens' meeting place to \"hang out\", share knowledge and learn, which is coordinated in four topic areas: Be, Do, Tell and Think.\nIt is a project open to all in the city but focused on young people, it is equipped with tools and areas for research, experimentation and co-creation in different fields of knowledge such as robotics, astronomy and biodiversity.\nIn the future, it will be designed to be a physical place in a building with a friendly, flexible and diverse environment.\nOverall objective\nFoster the development of educational activities to gain young people's interest, starting with their appropriation of science, technology and innovation.\nSpecific objectives\n\u2022\tGenerate a space that facilitates the acceptance of young people's knowledge.\n\u2022\tStrengthen young people's creative skills.\n\u2022\tEmpower the exchange of knowledge and social innovation.\nRelation to the development plan\nThis project intends to reduce inequality in the population.

It is a process that we aim to consolidate with our new development plan \"Medellin Is Counting on You\"; a roadmap that we will follow this year and the next three years.\nThe municipality's Security and Coexistence Public Policy was approved in September 2015. It aims to \"increase the capacity of the citizens and institutions to govern phenomena that affect security and coexistence'I. During its preparation, the concept of security for the city was redefined. This concept observes that \"security and coexistence are not exclusive matters to crime and criminality (...), they are phenomena in which there are very complex underlying relations of cause, which require comprehensive interventions that implement measures conceived in a wide spectrum from early prevention of violence to reestablishment of rights\"2. The extension of this definition is not to be underestimated, because it allowed us to integrate strategic guidelines that as well as having an impact on security, seek social transformations for building peace in the region, key to the idea of making this a resilient city.\nTherefore, and as part of the Development Plan and Security and Coexistence Policy, we aim to build peace in our region, investing in training citizens to take on peaceful coexistence as part of daily living. In addition,\nwe aim to defend the role of democratic institutions as a tool for resolving conflicts, to avoid resorting to violence or intermediation of illegal powers. We aim to recover the legitimacy of government institutions responsible for ensuring security in the city and will work to build peace through clear access to justice, especially in the most vulnerable areas, and through the prevention of violence.\nWe will consolidate and invest in existing successful political initiatives such as the integration of former fighters into civil life, aiming to break the vicious cycle of illegal activities, as well as work on the reparation of the victims of the armed conflict who live in vulnerable and isolated conditions. The government has also been leading an exercise to rebuild a historical memory to help create the cultural transformations that the city needs. Finally, and as shown on the following pages, Medellin is a resilient city, because we are focusing our efforts on achieving equal rights for most socially vulnerable groups, such as young people and women.\nTo summarize, we understand that to be a resilient city, security is a right. In the current situation, this means the creation and strengthening of political actions to build sustainable peace in our region based on coexistence, recovery of the legitimacy of the government institutions, promotion of local democracies, access to justice, integration of former fighters, support for victims, and reconstruction of remembrance.\n1.\tMedellin Council.

Our work is to know the limitations and capacities of our partners to promote quicker and more effective actions.\" Pedro Junqueira, CRO of Rio de Janeiro\nThe Rio Operations Center has been operating since December 2010. with more than 900 cameras and 500 employees. Through three daily operational meetings data driven decisions can be made.\nThrough an agreement with Waze. the Rio Operations Center has information about congestion hot spots. Additionally, the location of security personnel is monitored through their cellphones, for quick deployment around the city.\nIn areas where there is a high-risk of landsides. sirens have been installed to alert the population. Additionally, there is a series of rain gauges located in strategic points around the city to measure rainfall and identify areas potentially at risk from flooding. Community leaders can then be notified, so that they can appropriately prepare.\nPolitical will is the most important thing needed to achieve such an integrated information system.\nPhotography Oscar Cardona Alvarez\nTalking about risk management undoubtedly means talking about social regions, more humane regions, resilient regions and everyone's struggle to recover from and overcome difficulties. The challenge is to create safe areas, and environmentally sustainable and safe cities, as established by Law 1523 of 2012, in paragraph 1 of Article 1: Risk management is an essential development policy to ensure sustainability; regional security; collective interests and rights; and improvement of the quality of life of populations and communities at risk. Therefore, it is intrinsically related to the planning of safe development, and to sustainable environmental management of the land, at all levels of governance and with the effective participation of the population.\nWhen it is understood that risk management is a comprehensive social process where community and collective work comes before individual and private work, opportunities can be developed to strengthen the resilience capacity of the people and the whole society. However, if risk management is not tied to community participation as a central theme of the risk reduction policies, it cannot solely be the tool or the path to prepare the communities to face the historical challenge of populating the land.\nReturning to look at the basis of society, preparing the communities to be the agents of their own development,\nempowering them and making them active must be the ultimate goal of all the resilience-centered risk management policies. Providing all the tools so that the communities know how to identify their risks is another way of making them more resilient in order to ensure the continuity of the services and benefits that become available their urban areas.\nTherefore, making Medellin a sustainable, balanced city in harmony with everything that surrounds it is a task that despite being difficult has not been neglected. Currently, Medellin is working on building a comprehensive perspective of risk management based on the population's leaderships, and focused on great community participation to reduce the social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities.\nGiven that risk management is a responsibility of all the authorities and residents of the region (Article 21 of Law 1523), the sum of all these actions helps the inhabitants on their land to identify the risks and strengthen their skills, generating work in a network that, coordinated with institutional action, achieves a real cultural transformation that fosters new ways for us to understand and interpret reality, and makes us increasingly more adaptive to the challenges that our environmental and urban surroundings pose each day.\nThe Medellin Resilience Office has reviewed different initiatives and projects that are being implemented in the city, and others that are planned for the future. According to this process, we consider that the actions to achieve a sustainable and risk-prepared Medellin are as follows.\nFlagship Initiative\n3.A Strengthening of Community Risk Management\nThis is a pilot project that aims to train a group selected from the 102 local risk management committees located in the neighborhoods of Medellin. These committees are responsible for identifying and alerting the communities about the possible natural risks that may occur, so they can take preventative measures to save lives.\nThe main topics are focused on disaster prevention, and the mitigation strategies during an event, requiring community risk management, early-warning social networks, social mapping of risk, and disaster management strategies.\nOverall objective\nStrengthen community risk management through the local committees and the construction sector, such as master builders, in order to generate greater use of risk prevention technologies and techniques and of the Early-Warning System to promote their role in their communities as leaders of risk management.\nSpecific objectives\n\u2022\tTrain ten local risk management committees on prevention and response (what to do before and after an event).\n\u2022\tTraining builders, city officials, and private\nstakeholders, in seismic evaluation and retrofit design and construction on existing informal houses, to mitigate seismic risk. Including research, development of technical resources, evaluation of existing homes, design and construction of mitigation solutions (structural and architectural retrofits). This, leveraging the Medellin's existing home improvement and structural upgrade subsidy.\n\u2022\tTrain a group of informal builders on regulations and appropriate foundations for construction.\n\u2022\tInstall early-warning communication networks.\n\u2022\tPrepare social maps of risk, resilience and disaster management.\n\u2022\tCoordinate information between the neighborhood risk\nmanagement committees.\n\u2022\tGenerate strategies for prompt communication of information.\n\u2022\tImprove the information of the Early-Warning System.\nRelation to the development plan\nThis action is part of the \"A City Investment in Care of the Environment\" dimension, of the \"Medellin Manages Risk\" challenge, and of the \"Risk Reduction and Mitigation\" program, as part of the project: \"Strengthening of the DAGRD\".\nParties responsible for its implementation\nMedellin Resilience Office, and the Administrative Department of Disaster Risk Management (Departamento Administrative de Gestion del Riesgo de Desastres, DAGRD).\nPlatform partners\nTo strengthen this initiative of the Medellin Resilience Office together with the city's public and private institutions, we are working in partnership with: Build Change and Escuela Latinoamericana de Desarrollo Local Sostenible y Resiliente (ELADES).\nTerm:\nShort term - less than one year.\nResilience Dividends\nIn line with the \"resilience dividend\", this flagship initiativehighlights the potential for co-benefits to result from its main objective of strengthening community risk management through the local committees and the building agents, such as master builders, in order to generate greater appropriation of the technical components of risk prevention and of the Early-Warning System to promote their participation in the communities as leaders in risk management. By implementing this flagship initiative, we will support additional co-benefits such as: essential services, natural and man-made assets, social cohesion, promotion of integrated and longterm planning, effective management and leadership, and empowerment of a wide range of stakeholders. Specifically in the initiatives: Comprehensive Project to Rehabilitate the Hillside -Anticipating Illegal Growth on the Hillsides of Medellin-; Risk Awareness and Reduction Program (CRRP for the Spanish acronym); Resilience Laboratory; Risk Assurance and Transfer for Resilient Cities; Strengthening of the Early-Warning System;\nPilot Project for Preventative Resettlement of Land at Immitigable Risk; and Our River.\nAcute shocks and chronic stresses addressed:\n\u2022\tViolence and conflict\n\u2022\tLandslides\n\u2022\tStructural deterioration\n\u2022\tIllegal settlement\n\u2022\tDisplacement\n\u2022\tPoor quality urban planning\n\u2022\tEarthquakes\nIndicators\n\u2022\tEnsure the continuity of essential services: Emergency plans for essential services.\n\u2022\tMaintain, create and improve natural and man-made assets: Environmental policies.\n\u2022\tPromote cohesive and committed communities Community participation, journalism and connectivity.\n\u2022\tEncourage integrated and long-term planning: Monitoring and data management, strategies and plans.\n\u2022\tPromote leadership and effective management: Emergency coordination and capacity, alignment of the government.\n\u2022\tEmpower a wide range of stakeholders: Understanding of the risks.\n\u2022\tSocial Offices of the DAGRD prepared and trained on risk management.\nMonitoring activities of the Resilience Office\n\u2022\tBuild and develop the workshops to carry out with the local risk management committees.\n\u2022\tFind the experts to train the committees on issues of local risk management.\n\u2022\tFocus groups with the professional team of the DAGRD.\nPhotography: Oscar Cardona Alvarez\nOther initiatives that support the goal: Sustainable and Risk Prepared Medellin\n3.B Comprehensive Project to Resettle\nthe Hillside-Anticipating Illegal\nSettlement on the Hillsides of Medellm-\nThrough the implementation of green infrastructure and the consolidation of a productive landscape, the aim is to mitigate risk and prepare for housing settlement in high-risk areas of the city.\nThe project needs to be implemented through collaborative self-management such that the community is a central agent in the co-creation and implementation of the processes. This is essential to ensure future sustainability of the interventions, and the communities' empowerment in controlling and governing the land.\nObjective\nDefine strategies and processes for the collaborative construction of a sustainable habitat on the high parts of the city's hillsides through the implementation of control actions and anticipation of the settlement of the illegal urban boundaries of the city to prevent new disasters from occurring.\nRelation to the development plan\nThis project was designed by a private institute of the city focused on urban and environmental studies and had the support of the DAGRD, and the Administrative Department of Planning of Medellin.\nParties responsible for its implementation\nCenter for Urban and Environmental Studies (URBAM), and the Administrative Department of Planning of Medellin.\nPlatform partners\nTogether with the city's public and private institutions, the Medellin Resilience Office is working on the identification of strategic platform partners that are part of the 100 Resilient Cities Program to strengthen this initiative.\n3.C Risk Knowledge and Reduction\nProgram (CRRP)\nThis program focuses on the community's active participation in planning processes to reduce the risk of disasters. It will identify and prioritize risk scenarios to reduce the risk of failure of infrastructure, and to ensure economic recovery of the market systems existing in the neighborhoods. The program will focus on populations in the peripheral areas of Medellin as needing the most support in disaster reduction.\nThe areas of work are as follows: 1. Policy and planning in disaster risk management; 2. Housing and settlements, my house as a safe place; and 3. Economic recovery and market systems.\nObjective\nReduce the social and economic impact of disasters in highly vulnerable populations of Medellin.\nRelation to the development plan\nThis project has been implemented in the city since 2015 with international funding and the support of the DAGRD.\nParties responsible for its implementation\nUniversidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB), and the Administrative Department of Disaster Risk Management (Departamento Administrative de Gestion del Riesgo de Desastres, DAGRD).\nPlatform partners\nTogether with the city's public and private institutions, the Medellin Resilience Office is working on the identification of strategic platform partners that are part of the 100 Resilient Cities Program to strengthen this initiative.\nTerm\nMedium term - from two to three years.\nTerm\nMedium term - from two to three years.\nPhotography: Oscar Cardona Alvarez\n3.D Resilience Laboratory\nThis is a proposal to bring together a committee of high-level strategic planning advisors of to identify urban development strategies.

To achieve this, disaster risk is assessed and quantified, to define and measure the resulting liabilities. Using this information, the aim is to design a comprehensive financing strategy, taking into account the frequency and severity of the events, which improves the city's capacity to respond after disasters without compromising the sustainability of public finances.\nObjective\nTogether with cities that have decided to transfer their risk with insurance companies, create a comprehensive strategy for the management of catastrophic risks in Medellin.\nRelation to the development plan\nThis action is part of the \"A City Investment in Care of the Environment\" dimension, of the \"Medellin Manages Risk\" challenge, and of the \"Risk Reduction and Mitigation\" program, as part of the project: \"Risk Assurance and Transfer\".\nParties responsible for its implementation\nAdministrative Department of Disaster Risk Management (Departamento Administrative de Gestion del Riesgo de Desastres, DAGRD).\nPlatform partners\nTo strengthen this initiative of the Medellin Resilience Office together with the city's public and private institutions, we are working in partnership with the World Bank Treasury.\nWe are also exploring the possibility of working with other platform partners, such as: Risk Management Solutions (RMS) and SwissRe.\nTerm\nLong term - four years or more.\nObjective\nCollect information from the accelerometer, the rain gauges and the hydrometeorological network to deliver it to the responsible authorities and the general public so that they are aware of the risks and can take measures in time.\nRelation to the development plan\nThis action is part of the \"A City Investment in Care of the Environment\" dimension, of the \"Medellin Manages Risk\" challenge, and of the \"Risk Awareness\" program, as part of the project: \"Strengthening of the SIATA and Innovation for Risk Management\".\nParties responsible for its implementation\nAdministrative Department of Disaster Risk Management (Departamento Administrative de Gestion del Riesgo de Desastres, DAGRD).\nPlatform partners\nTo strengthen this initiative of the Medellin Resilience Office together with the city's public and private institutions, we are working in partnership with Pacifico.\nWe are also exploring the possibility of working with the American Geophysical Union (AGU).\nTerm\nLong term - four years or more.\n3.F Strengthening of the Early-Warning\nEnvironmental System - SIATA\nThrough the Early-Warning Environmental System (SIATA) of the municipality of Medellin, a prognostic atmospheric model and a hydrological response model will be implemented in the basin of Valle de Aburra River to develop an appropriate forecast model for the Medellin's topography. The operation and maintenance of the networks form part of the SIATA - Accelerograph Network of Medellin (RAM for the Spanish acronym) and the Hydrometeorological Network.... Through the regular collection and processing of the information stored in each accelerograph, we will obtain useful tools for the analysis and design of earthquake-resistant structures. Additionally, the information will be publicized through the internet and printed material for distribution with biannual editions for a technical audience and additionally, the maintenance, update and\/or replacement of prioritization and quantification equipment.\n3.G Pilot Project for Preventative Resettlement of Land with Unmitigable\nRisk\nThis project consists of solutions for resettling populations located in areas where the risk cannot be mitigated (because of movements of land or risk of flooding) to sustainable areas more suitable for living.\nObjective\nProgressively reduce conditions of threat or risk, improve living conditions and intervene in one of the regions prioritized in the Land Management Plan, developing a comprehensive methodology that includes criteria to protect inhabitants and promote sustainability.\nRelation to the development plan\nThis action is part of the \"Comprehensive Intervention in the Land and Recovery of the Center\" dimension, of the \"Suitable Habitat for Medellin\" challenge, and of the \"Comprehensive Resettlement of the Population\" program, as part of the project: \"Pilot Project for Preventative Resettlement of Land at Immitigable Risk\".\nParties responsible for its implementation\nMedellin Social, Housing and Habitat Institute (Instituto Social de Vivienda y Habitat de Medellin, ISVIMED).\nPlatform partners\nTo strengthen this initiative of the Medellin Resilience Office together with the city's public and private institutions, we are working in partnership with Build Challenge, Risk Management Solutions (RMS), and World Bank Treasury.\nWe are also exploring the possibility of working with SwissRe.\nTerm\nMedium term - from two to three years.\n3.H Our River\nThis project intends to repair the stream channels through the coordination between different regional bodies facilitating the generation of comprehensive sanitation through: 1.

The data must be used to analyze the city's situations, problems and challengesthrough integration in to qualitative processes to make more informed decisions and development plans. These activities will ensure the sustainability and quality of life for citizens.\nWe must take advantage of technological progress and the development of collaborative platforms that provide government and citizens with an equal understanding of the current state of the city. This will help to identify successful solutions to problems and challenges on a sustained basis\nOpen data generates trust between the public sector and the citizenry. It forms the basis for jointly creating proposals for the city in a collaborative and transparent manner that integrates and involves all actors of society in the process, giving them the power of knowledge to think, analyze and build a better city.\nIn the future, this dynamic will be essential to plan and develop resilient cities based on knowledge, dissemination and reuse of data in an open format.\nFor approximately two years, the Medellin Resilience Office reviewed different initiatives and projects that were being implemented in the city, and other new ones that have been proposed. After this review process, we consider that the main actions proposed to achieve a well-informed Medellin are as follows.\nFlagship Initiative\n4.A Agency for the Management\nand Integration of Information\nThis project will create a neutral agency to integrate\nand coordinate the city's information.

International collaboration helps to create more vigorous, robust and forward-looking cities.\nMembership of the 100RC network offers us a fantastic opportunity to collaborate with a range of international players with the goal of making Vejle a more resilient city. Over the past 3 years, we have focused on identifying challenges and opportunities to develop our city into an even better place to live for all our citizens.\nThe resilience strategy focuses on four central development areas, aligning with our modern welfare society. These are the Co-creating City, Climate Resilience,\nSocial Cohesion and Smart City. Within each area, we have identified a list of\nspecific actions, which we will work on carrying out during the coming years -hopefully in collaboration with our new international partners.\nIn Vejle, we are privileged to have a good starting point. But it is important that we continue developing and sharing our experiences with others working to develop a resilient city of the future. With the resilience strategy, we are building on the City Council's vision \u201cWe Make it Happen\u201d. We are ambitious on behalf of Vejle and have a strong will to strengthen the city's resilience, create a strong community and ensure the positive development of our society.\nVejle seeks to turn its current challenges into opportunities. Our ambition is to become an innovative lighthouse that demonstrates how small cities can solve big problems and show great responsibility. With our resilience strategy we invite all partners to action and cooperate in the development of tomorrow's resilient Vejle - a cohesive, robust and sustainable city.\nMichael Berkowitz\n100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, is pleased to partner with the Municipality of Vejle to release the first resilience strategy in the Scandinavian region, and in Europe. This marks a turning point in an extraordinary journey for this incredible Danish city, which continues to build its reputation as a global thought-leader and innovator in urban resilience ideas and practices.\nFirst and foremost, I'd like to thank the City Council of Vejle and Mayor Arne Sigtenbjerggaard for his vision, passion, and dynamic partnership with us over the past three years. Jonas Kroustrup, the city's Chief Resilience Officer, and the senior city officials who provided him with extraordinary support, have gone above and beyond to produce this visionary document.\nBuilding city resilience requires recognizing the interplay of a city's strengths, weaknesses, shocks, and stresses. It is also about bolstering the foundation of a city so that it can respond to new, unforeseen events, and plan for the unknown. While Vejle is relatively small in terms of its size and population, it has proven to be capable of addressing these big challenges, and is an inspiration to other cities in its region.\nVejle has put in tremendous efforts to integrate resilience as an organizing principle. At the core of this journey is the city's proud identity and history stretching back to King Bluetooth himself. Vejle has gone to great lengths to demonstrate that it is a place of cutting-edge thinking and innovative partnerships, including those with 100RC Platform Partners such as Arcadis, a global firm specializing in design, infrastructure and water management. Vejle is also at the forefront of demonstrating how the lauded Scandinavian model can evolve given the imminent challenges and opportunities at its doorstep - whether it be increased immigration, climate change or adapting to new technologies.\nThis strategy, which is the result of many months of research, stakeholder engagement, self-assessment, and analysis, looks to identify a tactical roadmap for the future. It identifies a range of goals and concrete initiatives which will address the interplay of the city's challenges and opportunities.\n100 Resilient Cities is committed to working with the municipality of Vejle to implement the vision laid out in this strategy. With the support of 100RC's Platform of Partners\u2014a powerful cadre of public, private, non-profit, and academic organizations\u2014we will bring important resources to this partnership. In turn, Vejle will play a critical role in informing the market, spurring on development of new tools and services that cities around the world can use to build their own resilience. Once again, congratulations to Vejle!\nResilient Vejle Partnerships\nIn Vejle, we believe in co-creation and strong\npartnerships. Our future work on resilience\nwill be supported and implemented by our\nexisting partnerships with the business sectors, education institutions and housing committees. It is by joining forces with our partners that we aim to build resilience in Vejle. An overview of\nour existing partnerships includes;\nThe Innovation Committee\n\u201dTHE INNOVATION COMMITTEE DEVELOPS AND TESTS IDEAS THAT CAN FORM THE FUTURE OF VEJLE. WE SEE IT AS OUR\nTASK TO CHALLENGE AND HELP THE MUNICIPALITY WITH DEVELOPING A FORWARD-THINKING, INNOVATIVE AND RESILIENT SOCIETY THAT IS ATTRACTIVE FOR BOTH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND FOR THE CITIZENS. THE RESILIENCE STRATEGY POINTS TOWARD A RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES, WHERE THE INNOVATION COMMITTEE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE BY DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS\u201d\nTorben Christensen, administrative director at Good Food Group A\/S, vice president of The Innovation Committee\nThe Innovation Committee was established in\n2014 as a business policy committee consisting of seven business leaders, three representatives from the education institutions of Vejle, as well\nas seven politicians from the City Council. The\nwork of the Committee is based on the vision\nof the City Council \u201cWe Make it Happen\u201d, and\ninvolves challenging and testing scenarios for\nthe future Vejle.\nThe Business and Education Liaison Committee\n\u201dTHE COMMITTEE IS IN DIALOGUE WITH THE LOCAL BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE QUALIFYING EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP RESILIENT SOLUTIONS FOR THE SOCIETAL CHALLENGES WE FACE.\nTHIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT RESTRICTED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND SMART CITIES, THE COMMITTEE ALSO IDENTIFIES GROWTH POTENTIAL FOR THE CITY. VEJLE'S\nMEMBERSHIP OF THE 100RC NETWORK WILL FACILITATE ACCESS TO NEW AND EXCITING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.\u201d\nJacob Madsen, Vice President for Danfoss, Chairman of the Business and Education Liaision Committee\nThe Business and Education Liaison Committee was established in 2014 and is composed broadly of representatives from the business sector, educational sector and the City Council. The Committee's work includes maintaining and attracting more job opportunities to the municipality and strengthening public - private collaboration.\nHousing Policy Steering Group\n\u201dTHE HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS ARE ACTIVE PARTNERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY, AND IN FINDING COMMON SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES OF URBANIZATION, CLIMATE CHANGE AND FLOODING. RESILIENCE IS A NEW WAY TO CREATE VALUE FOR THE ENTIRE CITY AND STRENGTHEN ITS COHESION ACROSS RESIDENTIAL AREAS THROUGH A BROAD JOINT EFFORT\u201d\nThe social housing organizations in Vejle (AAB,\n0sterBO, Lejerbo and Domea)\nThe aim of the Housing Policy Steering Group is to advise the housing associations and the municipality on housing policy, and integration of social housing residential developments. The Steering Group sets the policy direction and ensures political dialogue.\nCouncil of Education\n\u201dTHE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF VEJLE APPROACH RESILIENCE WITH AN EXCITING NEW LEARNING PERSPECTIVE. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE MUNICIPALITY OF VEJLE AND THE BUSINESSES OF THE AREA TO DEVELOP THE EDUCATION OF THE FUTURE AND PREPARE OUR STUDENTS TO MANAGE A TECHNOLOGICALLY AND SOCIALLY CHANGING SOCIETY.\u201d\nErik Knudsen, principle for University College Lilleb^lt, member of the Council of Education\nThe Municipality of Vejle and the educational institutions in Vejle have been collaborating with the Council of Education for many years. Our aim is to jointly develop Vejle as an attractive city for education and ensure that all young people have the best possible opportunity for completing a high quality education.\nSome of the institutions we are in dialogue\nwith include R0dkilde Gymnasium, Rosborg Gymnasium & HF, Southern Denmark Technical College (SDTC), Campus Vejle, School of social health, Business Academy Lilleb^lt and University College Lilleb^lt.\n\u201dWITH THE RESILIENCE STRATEGY WE ARE CONSTRUCTING THE FOUNDATION FOR THE COMING GENERATIONS AND SECURING A CITY AND SOCIETY THAT\nIS PREPARED FOR WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS\u201d\nJonas Kroustrup, Chief Resilience Officer\nPurpose of Vejle's\nresilience strategy\nVejle's resilience strategy will strengthen the\nfoundation of our city during both good and\nbad times. Our work on resilience is across the municipality, civil societies and the business community, to enhance our capacity and\njointly turn challenges into new opportunities. It is also by joining forces with our existing and newly established partnerships that we aim to build resilience in Vejle.\nWhat is urban resilience?\n\u201dURBAN RESILIENCE IS THE CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS, BUSINESSES, AND SYSTEMS WITHIN A CITY TO SURVIVE, ADAPT, AND GROW NO MATTER WHAT KINDS OF CHRONIC STRESSES AND ACUTE SHOCKS THEY EXPERIENCE.\u201d \u201d\n100 Resilient Cities\nWe act on new challenges to create opportunities\nVejle is responding to the city's needs through an increase in housing provision and economic growth, but the city needs to do more in light of its challenges. Recently, we have begun to witness the potential consequences of climate change, globalization, immigration and population growth - challenges, which to a large extent will affect the welfare of our society, and our future.\nSome of our core challenges\nWe have identified the challenges, but not yet their long term implications. The resilience strategy focuses particularly on the climatic, economic and social challenges which\nare putting our city under pressure. These\nchallenges need to be addressed through\nnew partnerships, and innovative approaches. It will require us to work together, and collaborate across organizations - both now and in the future. We call this resilience through co-creation.\nThrough the resilience strategy, we wish to\nconsider the following:\nResilience creates value\nOur long term effort for a resilient Vejle will not only contribute to minimizing the risks and costs, but it will also create stability and safety; increase our welfare conditions, our spirit of entrepreneurship, and our investments and business development opportunities.\nVejle's participation in 100 Resilient Cities is a unique opportunity to collaborate with international networks and gain access to new knowledge. At the same time, 100 Resilient Cities will in the long term become a source for resilience building solutions for cities, which will create opportunities for businesses, both in Vejle and in the rest of Denmark. Through the resilience strategy, we set a foundation for our young generations to ensure a city and a society that is prepared for the future.\nIn Vejle, we want to build resilience by focusing on the development of collaboration at both the\nmunicipal and local scale.\nWe will build scenarios around the challenges affecting our citizens and businesses.\nIntroduction to Vejle\nTHE RESILIENCE CAPITAL OF DENMARK\nVejle - a modern city\nToday we are poised to make a big leap and a decisive step in the city's history - we are well on our way to becoming a larger and more modern city.\nOrigin of Vejle: Water as an asset\nThe name Vejle comes from the ancient Danish word \u2018wither which means fjord. Vejle has always seen water as an asset, and forms part of its history and identity. The first settlements, dating back to the 12th century, were built in the middle of Vejle Stream Valley where the Grejs Stream meets Vejle River, just as it runs into the fjord. Since the first settlements, the water has been the symbol of life in Vejle.\nSetting of Vejle: Water and the city\nVejle's beautiful location between Vejle Stream Fjord and Vejle Valley creates opportunities to use nature to create an attractive city. In the centre of Vejle two valleys meet; Vejle Stream Valley from the west - Denmark's longest Tunnel Valley, and the Grejs Valley from the North - the largest gorge in Denmark.\nEconomy and business\nIndustry and manufacturing still characterize Vejle today. However in recent decades a number of creative businesses and IT companies are emerging, many of which are located in \u2018The Spinning Mill', one of Denmark's largest development and innovation environments. Today, Vejle serves as a logistical centre in Denmark and forms part of largest regional collaboration - The Triangle region.\nIntegration\nIn 2012 Vejle was announced as the Best Municipality for Integration in Denmark, and is currently considered as an exemplar municipality for welcoming refugees.\nInnovation in Vejle\nVejle is amongst the first cities in Denmark to implement innovation as a strategy across all its administrations.\nSustainability\nVejle has a long and proud tradition of sustainable practices. Sustainable growth is a term central to the City Council's vision \u2018Vejle -\nWe Make it Happen'.\nVejle - the digital provincial city\nThe Municipality of Vejle is at the forefront of the development of smart-city solutions in Denmark. This development was driven initially by the needs of our citizens, businesses and organizations.\nCity development in Vejle\nVejle was the first municipality in Denmark to implement an architecture policy. In recent years the city has undertaken extensive urban development.\n\u201dVEJLE IS A SMALL PLACE WHERE BIG THINGS HAPPEN\u201d\nVikram Singh, 100 Resilient Cities\nVejle's Strategic Pillars\nOur resilience strategy is framed around four strategic pillars, 12 goals and 100 actions.\nThis section includes the actions that we will develop and launch between 2016 and 2020. Each pillar is further defined by a number of goals.\n1.\tA Co-creating City\nWe will create tomorrow's resilient city\nthrough productive partnerships across\npublic and private sectors.\nGoals:\n1.1\tWe will make resilience central to the Municipality's vision and plans\n1.2\tWe will use co-creation to build resilience capacity\n1.3\tWe will develop innovative resilient city solutions and scale up best practices\nIn Denmark, we have a long tradition of\nco-creation; collaboration between public\nand private institutions, businesses, and\ncommunities in the city to address challenges.\nWe want to ensure that the concept continues to be a key aspiration for resilience and resilience building actions.\nCo-creation is a cross-cutting pillar that\nintegrates across all the other pillars. We\nwill focus on developing, integrating and\nimplementing resilience across the various\nsectors and departments in the municipality\nto continue to improve our public-private\ninnovation work.\nWe want to work with those who have the drive\nand desire for action - be it locally, regionally, nationally or internationally. In our co-creative city we will primarily focus on integrating\nresilience into our municipal strategies.\n2.\tA Climate Resilient City\nWe will use water and climate change as drivers for development of the city.\nGoals:\n2.1\tWe will protect Vejle and turn the water into an asset for urban and social capital\n2.2\tWe will establish public-private partnerships for resilient utilities\n2.3\tWe will secure growth by using sustainable resources, renewable energy and green transport\nWater in Vejle is both an asset and a challenge. Vejle city is designated as one of ten Danish risk areas where there is a significant flood risk due to rising sea levels, increasing rainfall and flooding. There are several large key physical assets in Vejle. All are well maintained and monitored but it is also apparent that there is a need to address the coming risk in relation to flooding and increase in rain, as this will pose a serious treat in future years.\nOur assets are vulnerable to climate change, this includes the harbour, the coastal area, the urban core and some of our infrastructure (small bridges and tunnels in west side urban core). Our water and sewage system are not prepared for heavy rain and flooding, some of the energy transformer stations and communication infrastructure in the city are also vulnerable to flooding. Today, we have a well-functioning emergency response capability, as well as climate and risk management action plans but we need to explore new innovative solutions that create attractive urban environments while protecting us from the potential risks associated with increased water.\n3.\tA Socially Resilient City\nWe will increase social and economic cohesion and create the best conditions for future generations.\nGoals:\n3.1\tWe will strengthen social resilience across the municipality together with our citizens and businesses\n3.2\tWe will make urban spaces and social housing central to community cohesion\n3.3\tWe will invest in Vejle's youth\nThe strategy process has identified a number of emerging social challenges that can adversely affect the quality of life and welfare in Vejle today and in the future. Our diagnostic analysis suggests an increased risk of polarization, which can happen to more vulnerable groups at a time of increased immigration. Furthermore, the diagnostic work also raised a concern about the challenges facing the youth of Vejle. It indicated a widening gap and loss of social cohesion between groups in society across economic status, culture and local identity. The diagnostic work took a holistic approach to the perception of social services and welfare in Danish society, and reviewed the existing initiatives from five different perspectives (strategic; geographical; thematic; methodological perspectives; whilst also considering the different target groups).\nThe principles of social resilience focus on reinforcing the societal shift from compensation thinking to resource building. This shift is under way in Vejle. However, the strong Danish welfare model is under economic and demographic pressures and the role of municipalities is changing. The public sector will no longer be a welfare services enterprise, but rather will function as a democratically run community of active, responsible and resourceful citizens, businesses and institutions. This is partly about delivering better and smarter services - and promoting a municipality that is robust and durable, not only economically but also socially.\n4.\tA Smart City\nWe will embrace new technologies and improve co-creation, efficiency, outreach and inclusivity.\nGoals:\n4.1\tWe will use Smart technologies to create an efficient society\n4.2We will support youth education in digital technologies\n4.3We will facilitate public access to open data towards creating a digital society\nNew technologies, better collection and use of data, and automation will help us generate efficient and innovative ways of addressing a variety of challenges around both climate change, urban development and economic growth whilst also improving our social resilience. Digital technologies provide a major innovation potential and an opportunity to make Vejle even more attractive. Our ambition is to make Vejle a Resilient Smart City - a city that acts intelligently in creating opportunities and in responding to shocks and stresses.\nA Resilient Smart City that is safe from cyberattacks; digitally inclusive; trustworthy in its use of data; and has a strong and well-functioning digital infrastructure.\nSection 5 includes the list of our 100 initiatives and actions. Our feature goals and actions are presented in full later in this chapter.\nStrategic pillar: is a strategic directio\nGoal: is a tangible and attainable obje\nLighthouse Action (Priority Action):\nOngoing:\nShort: Deliv\nMedium: D Long term:\nSupporting Action:\nInitiative:\nThe initiatives within the Strategic Pillars have\ndifferent characteristics and can be categorized as\namongst other things:\n\u2022 Integrating resilience into new visions, policies and strategies for Vejle's development.\n\u2022 Introducing new methods of strategic thinking and planning to incorporate resilience.\n\u2022 Rethinking existing efforts and using resilience as a holistic and dynamic approach.\n\u2022 Some new initiatives have been derived directly from the strategy process, others are initiatives that are already under development , but have been revisited and further developed to increase their resilience value through the strategy process.\n\u2022 The time frame is short, medium or long term.\nVEJLE 2050\nIntegrate resilience into the development of vision \u2018Vejle 2050' and into the municipal development plans\nDescription: The collective vision \u2018Vejle - We Make it Happen' has set ambitious targets for Vejle's development. The vision sets Vejle as a leader in attracting people and businesses, creating first class learning environments and in providing good welfare services. In light of the potential shocks and chronic stresses facing our city, such as urbanization, climate change and immigration, we need to make resilience central to our local development plans. We will work with local business, housing organizations, and education institutions to address the challenges and identify opportunities in Vejle to collectively incorporate resilience into the upcoming municipal plan and support long term planning of the city. We will develop a plan for cooperation between the municipality, the educational institutions and the business sector in 2016.\nObjective: To work collaboratively across public and private institutions to address our challenges and make resilience central to municipal plans.

The CRF provides a lens through which the complexity of cities and the numerous factors that contribute to a city's resilience can be understood. It comprises four dimensions and twelve key drivers, as illustrated by the two rings of the diagram.\nA resilient city also exhibits seven qualities, which should be evident in the way the city - or any system, function or asset within the city -operates. These qualities are:\nReflective - able to learn from past experiences to inform future decisions.\nResourceful - able to recognize alternative ways to use resources at times of crisis, in order to meet needs or achieve goals.\nInclusive - able to create a shared sense of ownership in decision making throughout the city, incorporating the knowledge and perspectives of all majority and minority groups.\nIntegrated - able to coordinate work across institutions and systems to catalyze additional benefits.\nRobust - comprising well-conceived, constructed and managed systems, capable of withstanding sudden shocks.\nRedundant - purposefully incorporating spare capacity to accommodate disruption due to extreme pressures, surges in demand or an external event.\nFlexible - willing and able to adopt\nalternative strategies in response to changing circumstances or sudden crises.\nVejle's resilience strategy is Denmark's first fully integrated response to city resilience. It addresses future uncertainty. Its holistic approach is essential to help tackle the shocks and stresses we face today, as well as tomorrow, and to transform our challenges into opportunities. Through cooperation with 100RC, Vejle has gained access to a framework, methods and tools for diagnosing shocks and stresses, and for enhancing resilience through strategic urban development.\nResilience Strategy Development\nThis Resilience Strategy builds on our existing capabilities, and addresses cross-cutting and emerging shocks and stresses within the environment, the economy and society. The strategy was developed by identifying the gaps in our existing approach to the city's resilience, which may prevent us from adequately addressing the shocks and stresses we face.\nWe have reviewed the city's current and future plans, projects and aspirations against the CRF and 100RC methodology, to determine how they contribute to our resilience agenda. In doing so, we have also identified new opportunities that would strengthen our overall approach to resilience.\nIn Phase I of Vejle's resilience strategy development, we looked at the city holistically to develop a Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA). We held a number of workshops to develop an understanding of the shocks and stresses facing the city, the vulnerable assets, people's perceptions and the city actions.\nThe PRA indicated that whilst there is a number of actions being taken across the drivers of the City Resilience Framework, these are not perceived by stakeholders as strengths for the city. The stakeholders particularly identified weaknesses related to \u2018cohesive communities' and \u2018empowerment of stakeholders'. These perceptions arise from the fact the welfare\nsystem is currently under pressure, both nationally and in Vejle, from demographic changes and increased polarization of communities. A number of cutbacks to existing initiatives are expected, which means the apparent good performance of the past is not expected to continue. Promoting social cohesion and citizen empowerment are huge concerns for stakeholders, and would require new and innovative cross-department initiatives to address them. Climate change, in particular flooding, was also identified by stakeholders as a stress that needs to be addressed. Our Preliminary Resilience Assessment led us to four discovery areas, which we focused on in greater detail as we developed the resilience strategy.\nIn Phase II we explored a series of research questions and activities to identify gaps in knowledge\/action and resilience building opportunities within the discovery areas. Workshops were carried out across stakeholder groups between September and December 2015. Gaps, opportunities, goals and actions were identified across the four discovery areas.\nStakeholder mobilization, dialogue\nand co-creation\nDuring the process, Vejle focused on engaging with municipal employees and businesses through a series of open events, meetings and conferences. We have established partnerships and collaborations with businesses, housing associations, and educational institutions, which were instrumental in identifying resilience actions. As part of our commitment to the 100RC network and strengthening the resilience of Vejle, we have encouraged professionals to take part in developing new resilience initiatives and opportunities for the city. We have engaged with them during the strategy process through workshops and conversations and invited communities from across the city to present their best resilience ideas and initiatives, through an Open Call from first of November 2015 to late January 2016.\nA variety of these initiatives identified collectively have contributed to the Priority Actions (Lighthouse Actions) described in Chapter 2.\nThe combined 100 Actions and Initiatives will be further developed, and facilitated by Vejle in 2016-2020.\nThe political process\nThe City Council is the unifying and leading body for Vejle's resilience strategy. To assist the strategy development through the political process, we published a collection of examples from existing resilience activities in Vejle, including political delegations to Glasgow, Rotterdam, Eindhoven and Barcelona, and discussions at City Council meetings and Financial and Specialist committees.\nValue Creation\nThe resilience strategy process has been the catalyst for a number of long-term political and strategic resilience agendas, a comprehensive development process at the political and professional level, the agreement of a number of actions, and inception of two major EU projects in Vejle. The partnerships we have established during the process have led to a number of \u201dcity laboratories for resilience\u201d, such as the Resilience Lab Denmark.\nResilient Vejle\nVejle's Resilience Diagnostic\nA shock is a sudden, acute event that may affect the city, such as a major flood or disease outbreak.\nA stress is a chronic condition that gradually weakens the city's fabric on a daily or cyclical basis, such as high rates of unemployment or severe traffic congestion.\nIn Vejle, the stresses we face on a daily basis are more significant than the relatively minor risk we face from major shocks. The primary focus of this resilience strategy is therefore to address our stresses. These challenges are well known; what remains to be seen is how they will manifest themselves in the long term.\nClimate and flooding\nOver recent decades, our climate has changed, increasing the risk of major floods in Vejle significantly. The threat of flooding is both a sudden shock and a long-term stress to the city.\nOver the past few hundred years, floods were recorded in the city every 4 or 5 years, however in the past decade, this rate has increased significantly. International organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Danish Meteorological Institute expect that climate change will bring more extreme rainfall, continued sea level rise and warmer weather in the future. The probability of flooding will increase over time, risking major damage to coastal areas by the fjord, harbor area and city centre. The impact of a 100-year storm could be disastrous.\nThe Municipality of Vejle has carried out several climate change and flooding risk and impact analyses. A Climate Change Adaptation Plan was developed in 2014, as well as a Risk Management Plan in connection with the EU Floods Directive, which has recently been approved by the City Council. These analyses suggest that the risk of flooding is increasing in large parts of the city.\nTo tackle this challenge, an investigation has been launched to consider the city's hydrological conditions and drainage system as well as conditions around the fjord.\nThese analyses sought to optimize the city's existing systems, reducing flood risk and allowing us to assess future climate risks and impact to the overall system. The current model has identified a number of critical issues as well as recommendations to address them. A proposal has also been developed to integrate flood protection into the overall urban development plan around the inlet.\nThrough the resilience strategy, Vejle has further identified the physical, social and economic implications of these flood risks, including increasing pressure on the city's basic functions and utility supplies. As a result, Vejle has taken the initiative to work more closely with energy, water and telecommunication utility companies. Climate change affects all communities and may lead to an increase in the polarization of society due to differentiated impacts between neighborhoods. Flooding also poses an increased risk of disease spreading if water from the sewage systems overflows. Over time this could discourage investment in the city. The threat of flooding also implies higher insurance premiums and lower levels of economic growth. Neither private citizens nor companies will settle where they are threatened by water.\nIn the short term, we are concerned with optimizing the city's capacity to withstand the risks we're facing. This includes both the technical infrastructure needed to manage water flows, as well as overall organizational readiness. In the long run this means looking at shocks and stresses as well as opportunities. Several physical changes are taking place in Vejle at the moment, especially in the most climate vulnerable areas of the city. We have to act now to ensure we put in place durable and sustainable solutions; adaptation to climate change must be integrated into existing urban development plans.\nRegional urbanization\nRising population and regional urbanization pose an increasing challenge to Vejle's infrastructure and mobility capacity. Expansion of transport systems is expected to increase to the extent that it totally overshadows all positive initiatives to reduce CO2 in other sectors including heating, electricity and agriculture. Alongside rising energy prices this trend has led to the development of Vejle's Strategic Energy Plan in 2010. The resilience strategy will continue this work and develop initiatives in transport and mobility, renewable energy and sustainability. This will help to reduce CO2 emissions and contribute to a cleaner, healthier city. Furthermore, Vejle will work to make its climate challenge a driver of new jobs in Vejle's \u201dgreen\u201d business sector.\nSmart, safe and inclusive infrastructure\nThrough the strategy process, Vejle mapped the city's assets and infrastructure to identify critical areas with potential for innovation. This evaluation found that day-to-day, the Municipality of Vejle manages its infrastructure and assets well, and that all relevant plans are up to date. However, there are also some areas, especially around the fjord in the west of the city and central areas that are particularly vulnerable to climate change and increased urbanization. Further work is needed in these areas to ensure increased accessibility and inclusiveness for vulnerable social groups.\nDigitalization - new solutions and challenges\nThe city, its businesses and citizens are in the process of implementing new digital and smart technologies. The municipality is using these in citizen and public services, as well as energy and education. Digitalization is a driver of efficiency, growth and job creation, and will provide solutions to many of the stresses the city faces. But it also has the potential to exacerbate divisions in our society, between those with access and those without. As the city becomes more dependent on digital systems, the issue of IT security for the city's functions, services and supplies is also becoming more pressing.\nChanging industries and the future labor market\nThe financial crisis in 2009 taught us that our industries and economy are even more closely connected to the global economy than we ever imagined. We are now facing an era in which industries and technology are evolving and creating new opportunities but the labor market is also more turbulent, new skills are required and employment conditions are more precarious for some. To ensure economic resilience, the Municipality of Vejle will continue to develop a collaborative relationship with local businesses and help to prepare future generations for these conditions.\nOur welfare model is facing increasing pressure\nSocial and economic changes are placing increasing pressure on the strong Danish welfare model's capacity to provide high quality public services. Demographic changes - such as aging communities and immigration - are increasing the social divide and presenting additional stress to public social services, city functions and utilities, which is leading to a rise in inequality, vulnerable groups and marginalized citizens. The influx of immigrants is also accelerating the continued stress on the welfare system, by increasing the growth in unskilled labor, therefore increasing unemployment and financial instability.\nVejle will therefore place a greater focus on being a flexible and adaptable municipality - both as an organization and as a community. Through the development of the resilience strategy, Vejle has identified opportunities to increase public spending for vulnerable families and youth, to improve the quality of life for immigrants and to improve certain residential and urban areas. The resilience strategy also reveals an increasing need for innovative actions that address social cohesion as our society becomes more diverse, especially in relation to immigration and vulnerable children and young people.\nResponding to our Stresses\n- Discovering Solutions\nHaving understood our existing resilience\nprofile, and the shocks and stresses we need\nto prepare for, we were able to focus on the\ntypes of solutions that will help us to build our\nresilience for the future. These solutions fall into\nfour main groups, which reflect the pillars of our\nresilience strategy.\nResilience and urbanization\nToday more than half of the world's population\nlives in cities, a trend that is expected to continue and could reach 75% by 2050. This implies not only a quantitative change in the number of people living in cities, but also a qualitative change in the way we live in urban environments. Cities are social and cultural centers, and\nengines for economic growth, but while urban\ndevelopment has many advantages, it can also\naccentuate the challenges cities face. In Vejle\nwe are experiencing increasing urbanization,\nthough not at the rate of some parts of the world. Nevertheless, we must prepare for it. So we ask ourselves, how should we go about it and plan for the future?\nFrom safeguarding society, to innovating for\nlong-term benefit\nVejle has a strong track-record in risk\nmanagement and safeguarding the city against\nsudden disasters, thanks to a cooperative\napproach between professionals and citizens.\nThis helps prevent crises and facilitates planning in the event of problems. By continually adapting and optimizing the city's physical infrastructure, we are able to protect and regulate our society.\nWe are also experienced at reacting to our\ncurrent shocks and stresses. At the same time,\nwe have a well functioning welfare society,\nwhich is the basis of our prosperity and growth. We support vulnerable citizens through close cooperation between government, civil society, private institutions and industry.\nTogether we are capable of withstanding\nstresses, optimizing our capacity to solve new\nchallenges and ensuring the needs of our\ncitizens are met. In Vejle, we will enhance the\ncity's organizational, managerial and societal\npreparedness to guide us towards a future in\nwhich we are able to respond proactively to\nstresses and shocks, preventing them from\nescalating or recurring, and transforming them\ninto drivers of development for the city.\nResilience through co-creation\nIn Vejle, we will work together to solve the\nchallenges of tomorrow - locally, regionally,\nnationally and internationally. We share the risk,\nso we must co-create the solutions. Co-creation through democracy and consensus are an essential part of creating a more resilient future.\nVejle's collaborative approach to resilience is\nabout looking beyond the political, social and\neconomic differences and using the strong\ntradition of collaboration to create realistic\nlong term solutions. The work on resilience is\nintegrated with a comprehensive strategy for\nco-creation across all sectors and departments, for the development and implementation of methods, values and organizational principles.\nEconomic resilience through value-adding prevention\nFacing new stresses and shocks can mean new\ncosts, but it doesn't have to be this way. By\nfocusing on resilience, wherever possible we will create multiple co-benefits via new solutions to new challenges. Through innovative and progressive funding models we are seeking to increase the investment potential of the city and its districts while reducing the risks - for example of flooding - for the benefit of investors, homeowners and all those who live, work and visit the city. Multifunctional recreational spaces which also protect the city against storm surges are one such example of the co-benefits of this approach. Resilience is about daring to look ahead, anticipating the shocks and stresses coming, to adapt and invest before it happens.\nWe will use resilience thinking to consider risks\nsuch as climate change and demographic\npressures in innovative new ways. And we will\nuse resilience thinking to focus holistically on\nco-creation, innovation, urban communities and the economy.\nGovernance of the Strategy Development Process\nVejle's Chief Resilience Officer (CRO), Jonas\nKroustrup, is the day-to-day lead for the resilience work, reporting to the Mayor and City Chief Executive. Under the leadership of the Political Steering Committee, and with assistance from Municipality employees and external partners, Jonas has led the strategy development process. International organizations and organizations such as ICLEI and Arup have also assisted as strategic partners in the process.\nWe have engaged and worked closely with our\nstakeholders including the communities, NGOs,\nbusinesses and cities from the 100RC network to inform our diagnostic activities and identification of resilience building opportunities.\nThe development of Vejle's resilience strategy\nhas been guided by a Steering Committee, which brings together the core groups of decision makers and stakeholders. These include the City Council, the Financial Committee and the Executive Board. In addition. The Municipality's Innovation Committee also had an essential role as an Advisory Board.\nThe strategy has also been cemented through\nexisting partnerships with the Educational\nCouncil, the Business Relations Committee and\nthe Housing Strategic Steering Group. At the\nsame time, Vejle has facilitated new knowledge,\ndialogue and cooperation through the Resilience Forum. Here researchers and interest groups have contributed to the development and\nunderstanding of resilience in Vejle.\nVejle has chosen this management model to\nbuild a strong internal and external engagement system for optimum leadership, co-creation, knowledge, and long-term partnerships.\nThis opens up the resilience strategy to the\nmunicipality's key partners in education, business, housing and local associations. This has created the optimal platform for co-creation, knowledge sharing, feedback and long-term partnerships.\nRESILIENT VEJLE\n63\nVejle and 100 RC\n1.\tVejle selected from 600 cities around the world\nIn December 2013, Vejle was selected as one of the first 32 cities to join the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) network.

She is in the back row second from the right.\nImplementation and Delivery (2016-2020)\nTo meet our ambitions and ensure ongoing delivery of the strategy's goals and actions, we will:\n\u2022 Implement the resilience actions and maximize the resilience value for Vejle.\nOver the coming years, Vejle will work to implement the actions in the resilience strategy taking into consideration the relevant political processes. We will make the resilience strategy central to the Municipality Plan, and aim to incorporate resilience into selected municipal policies and strategies.\n\u2022 Establish partnerships for resilience within Vejle.\nWe will establish a number of partnerships, such as \u2018Resilient Vejle' and the Resilience Lab, to address shocks and stresses and collaboratively deliver resilience solutions and actions. This will ensure coordination and integration between housing associations, businesses, educational and research institutions and the municipality.\n\u2022 Facilitate dialogue and engagement on the resilience agenda.\nVejle will establish an open \u2018Resilience Forum', and an annual Resilience Festival comprising forums for discussing and sharing knowledge around resilience. We also want to be transparent and therefore we will share our resilience experiences with other municipalities, businesses and interested organizations in both Denmark and Scandinavia.\n\u2022 Engage with 100RC and Platform Partners to identify effective mechanisms for implementation of our resilience actions.\nVejle will continue to engage and cooperate with cities in the 100RC network, and the Platform Partners, as well as exchange knowledge and experiences through the CRO network. This will help Vejle to continue learning from best practices around the world while also promoting our own best practices for others. This cross-cultural exchange will yield value for Vejle's citizens and decision makers.\n\u2022 Institutionalization of Vejle's resilience strategy.\nGoing forward, Vejle will work to institutionalize the resilience strategy by developing a new organizational structure in the municipality, including the CRO position alongside other supporting roles. The specific objectives and structure is still to be identified.\nA Co-creating City\nWe will create tomorrow's resilient city through productive partnerships across public and private

ability to respond to the numerous challenges that their city has faced. Nevertheless, as Quito\u2019s urban area and the challenges it faces become more and more complex, the city requires a new, more solid foundation to create plans and actions to be able to systematically respond to our vulnerabilities. The Quito Resilience Strategy provides a framework for the city to develop the planning and preparedness necessary for us to achieve our 2040 vision, building on ourstrengths and addressing ourchallenges.\nThis Strategy\u2019s overarching principles are to ensure a high quality of life for all the residents of the Quito Metropolitan District. These principles are based on five multidimensional pillars of action. Central to these actions are citizen participation, environmental management to support the life of our residents, and the construction ofthe city\u2019s first metro line. Together, these will lead to achieving an integrated and efficient city. Other key elements of the Strategy include developing capacity through inclusion, strengthening our urban fabric, and guaranteeing safety and security from both natural and manmade threats.\nOur partnership with The Rockefeller Foundation through the 100 Resilient Cities initiative has made it possible to create a rigorous strategy that integrates actions by various municipal departments as well as members of civil society and academia. The partnerships created through this initiative led to valuable exchanges of ideas, best practices and lessons learned from around the world.\nThis strategy is much more than an important input for the city\u2019s future. It represents a commitment to following and integrating its principles into a governing approach. At the one year anniversary of Quito\u2019s hosting the New Urban Agenda Habitat III conference, we reaffirm this important step toward achieving a resilient city in which all of Quito\u2019s residents can live together safely and securely.\nMICHAEL BERKOWITZ\nPRESIDENT OF 100 RESILIENT CITIES\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to congratulate the city of Quito, Mayor Mr. Mauricio Rodas, and Chief Resilience Officer David Jacome, on the release of the Resilient Quito, a major milestone for the city and for our partnership. This document lays out an extraordinary vision of urban resilience that can serve as a model to all. We are excited to see this ambitious Strategy take shape and lead to a stronger and even more dynamic Quito.\nStanding 2,800 meters above sea level at the center of the world on the equator, Quito is the political heart of Ecuador. The city not only boasts a rich history and cultural patrimony, represented by its beautiful historic center that received recognition asthefirstUNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978, but also an incredible wealth of biodiversity. With its central role as the host of the Habitat III Conference one year ago, Quito stands poised to become a model of urban resilience and signal to the rest of the world how the priorities of the New Urban Agenda can be realized.\nQuito\u2019s Resilience Strategy reflects this potential, the amazing progress the city has made in understanding its natural assets and vulnerabilities, and how they present opportunities for developingstrength and adaptability.To build Quito\u2019s resilience, it\u2019s necessary to have a deep understanding of the shocks and stresses the city endures, including severe natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, wildfires, and active volcanos; a history of economic instability; and unchecked urban sprawl and environmental degradation.\nQuitenos themselves are key to the city\u2019s Resilience Strategy. Known for their solidarity, energy and ingenuity, Quitenos are also disproportionately young: 1 out of 2 is underthe age of 29. In order to harness the momentum this presents; the Strategy contains several initiatives that aim to match young talent with professional and technical programs that will contribute to the city\u2019s economy and strengthen it overall.\nAlso fundamental to Quito\u2019s resilience-building efforts is its new metro line, the city\u2019s largest infrastructure project in history. Apart from its importance in linking a sprawling city, the new system presents an unprecedented opportunity for resilient\nurban development for the benefit of all Quitenos, by enabling a better quality of life through connectivity to job centers and to one another. It also presents a major environmental intervention that can reduce congestion, pollution, and the erosion of the city\u2019s rich biodiversity.\nOther initiatives that will provide multiple benefits include a program for safe public spaces; green infrastructure interventions to protect vulnerable neighborhoods and the transportation system; actions for embedding principles of sustainability and resilience in the Innovation Agenda of the city and for strengthening the information system with a risk index that strategically allows planningfor risk reduction.\nThis Strategy is only the beginning of the exciting work to come in the months and years ahead. And 100 Resilient Cities\u2019 partnership with thecity of Quito is also just beginning. Now we can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in thefollowing pages, which will positively impact all Quitenos. We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these efforts. Congratulations to the city of Quito!\nDAVID JACOME POLIT\nQUITO\u2019S CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER\nToday, when we must work on a global agenda that focuses on the well-being of all citizens, and with so many profound changes under way in our city\u2019s positive evolution, the Metropolitan District of Quito is in a unique position to take advantage of its human and biological capital while remaining faithful to its goal of becoming a more robust and inclusive city, and to identify our challenges and turn them into opportunities to create a prosperous future.\nThrough the Quito 2040 Vision, the city\u2019s residents have decided that the city will not only have a high quality of life but also be able to maintain that quality of life despite the many challenges that it faces and will continue to face in social, cultural, economic, and environmental terms. Building resilience for the city will ensure sustainable development for its inhabitants and set a clear agenda for the Metropolitan District\u2019s variety of management instruments.\nThe work reflected in this strategy reveals the Metropolitan District of Quito\u2019s strengths an d opportunities as it addresses the city\u2019s acute shocks and chronic stresses and prepares its citizens to face this century\u2019s challenges. While the scope is quite broad, the Resilience Strategy is not exactly a plan in the traditional sense of the word; instead it is an invitation to participate in a comprehensive work agenda. Resilient Quito establishes the path that we need to follow to strengthen our city by integrating procedures, programs, and policies that achieve pointed, multidimensional, and effective results.\nThe problems we are facing in the 21st century cannot be overcome with traditional tools and solutions. Urban resilience means taking on and adapting to complex challenges without forgetting to look ahead to the future. It is about being able to change our point of view, critically reviewing contributions to and from the city continuously, and developing abilities that make us stronger. The Quito Resilience Strategy places importance on what is possible. It proposes that we take advantage of the existing potential of our workforce, and it applies technical resources and best practices to equip Quito's residents forsuccess.\n1.1\tWHAT DOES RESILIENT QUITO MEAN?\nPerched high in the Andes, the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ) standsoutfora numberof factors formed by its dynamic diversity. At 2,800 meters above sea level, the city sits amid volcanoes and deep valleys. Quito was named a World Heritage Site in 1978 not only for its architecture but also because of this dramatic landscape and its biological diversity. At the same time, this cultural and natural wealth is threatened by a variety of environmental, economic, and social challenges.\nThe Quito Resilience Strategy is based on an analysis of these dynamics and the weaknesses and opportunities they represent. It sets forth an integrated, cross-disciplinary approach to the city\u2019s main acute shocks and chronic stresses. The Strategy was developed through tools that establish a new way of planning as developed through a resilience lens. It is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the New Urban Agenda (NUA), which was approved in Quito during Habitat III, and the Metropolitan Plan for Development and Land Management (PMDOT), which governs the municipality\u2019s work. A key contribution of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative for the Metropolitan District of Quito is that its resilience-building process can be used throughout the city\u2019s planning. It integrates the efforts of various levels of government, the private sector, civil society, and the scientific community. The Strategy\nachieves this by through the parameters proposed in the city\u2019s comprehensive long-term plan to 2040. These parametersdefine development as centered on achieving a high quality of life for all residents, and a city that is integrated, safe, inclusive, and prosperous. Fundamental to this vision of DMQ is the city\u2019s first metro line, the largest infrastructure project in Quito\u2019s history. This project can enable the kind of planning that leads to real transformation, of space, of social structures, and of economic development, and that is a key element in building urban resilience. The first metro line is also an important component in the city\u2019s promotion of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It plays a role in effective risk management and is an important opportunity to change the city\u2019s patterns of growth and development.\nWith most of the world\u2019s population living in urban areas, establishing urban resilience as a governing principle is fundamental to living in fairer and more sustainable societies. By building a resilient Quito, the city will be better able to find new opportunities, capitalize on existing ones, and be prepared to meet the challenges and risks it will face. This longterm commitment includes not only the Municipality as an institution, but all the people of Quito.\n2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nResilient Quito highlights the need to develop mechanisms that strategically respond to the acute shocks and chronic stresses that afflict the city. While the city\u2019s complex location creates structural vulnerabilities, other characteristics, such as its human and biological diversity, are clear signs of its historic ability to adapt. Resilient Quito is developed at a time of transformation for the Metropolitan District of Quito, both in terms of mobility and urban development. Construction of the first metro line and dedication to the New Urban Agenda, which was approved in Quito during Habitat III, define the new planning parameters.\nThe DMQ was selected to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative, which supports cities around the world in theireffortsto build urban resilience.Thisopportunity made it possible for Quito to analyze the city\u2019s vulnerabilities and challenges, evaluate its responsiveness to face them, and apply a planning approach focused on resilience as part of the local government\u2019s guiding principles.\nThe first phase of this strategy consisted of preparing a Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA) based on stakeholder engagement, action identification and risk assessment tools provided by 100RC. With the participation of local government, academia, and the private and civil sector, The Resilience Office of Quito held a series of workshops to conduct surveys and interviews to determine the acute shocks and chronic stresses most relevant to the city. The PRA identified the challenges and helped the CRO establish priorities.\nThe second phase identified the five key areas of the city with the highest priority for support in order to build meaningful resilience. The prioritization process was driven by the Municipality\u2019s ongoing actions and inspired by other cities\u2019 best practices. 100RC offered technical support, and the local government supported the implementation of the work. This two-phase process established the pillars, goals, and actions that helped create the resilience strategy, as detailed below.\nA.\tINCLUSIVE AND EMPOWERED CITIZENS\nBuilding urban resilience begins with strengthening social fabric. This pillar focuses on facilitating participatory processes as guidelines for democracy, validating the public administration\u2019s work, and strengthening processes of co-responsibility between citizens and the municipality. It aims at strengthening institutional and community capacities to build participatory processes and provide clear and effective mechanisms for citizen engagement.\nB.\tROBUST AND SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT\nManagement and conservation of the city\u2019s natural areas make sustainable urban development possible. The environmental pillar proposes developing efficient, participatory administration mechanisms for these areas that foster environmental consciousness and citizen involvement. This pillar also aims to encourage the use of nature based solutions for urban problems.\nC.\tINTEGRATED AND COMPACT CITY\nScattered and uncontrolled urban sprawl has made the Metropolitan District of Quito a segregated and inefficient city. This pillarfocuses on controlling urban sprawl, maximizing the positive impact of Quito\u2019s first metro line, and creating an integrated and efficient mobility system that favors active mobility.\nD.\tRESOURCEFUL AND SOLID ECONOMY\nBuilding economic resilience requires strengthening productive sectors and diversifying lines of business, all with an environment-friendly focus. This pillar creates an economic environment conducive to strengthening job supply and demand, with a special focus on youth. It fosters a diverse, sustainable, and innovative economy, and promotes the food-related economy as a guideline fordevelopment.\nE.\tREFLECTIVE AND SAFE TERRITORY\nThis fifth pillarfocuses on addressing the multiple threats and the high risk exposure due to the city\u2019s physical and socioeconomic vulnerability. This fifth pillarseeks to avoid creating new risks, mitigate existing risks, and prepare the city to respond to potential natural and man-made disasters.\nThe strategy also proposes mechanisms that facilitate cross-disciplinary planning and allow continuity overtime. This includes the institutionalization of the resilience agenda and its monitoring mechanisms, alignment with international development plans, adherence to the Metropolitan Plan for Development and Land Management, and training of resilience practitioners.\n2.1 STRATEGY SUMMARY AND CONTRIBUTION TO 2040 VISION\nQuito\u2019s Resilience Strategy contributes to the 2040 Quito Vision in a comprehensive way. The multidimensionality of this strategy\u2019s goals and actions allows it to contribute to all of the vision\u2019s challenges.\nVISION OF QUITO TO 2040\n\u201cQuito in 2040, will be a city with a high quality of life, capable of successfully facing all the challenges that arise in the social, cultural, economic and environmental fields and in the territory. It will thus become a resilient city and will have ensured the sustainable development of its population.\u201d\nAll DMQ residents and theirorganizations will have equal opportunities to achieve sustainable development in all\nareas of the district.\nINCLUSIVE AND OPEN CITY FOR EVERYONE\nQuito will be a citythat guarantees and facilitates the development of productive activities with innovative\ntechnologies that generate employment and wellbeing for its inhabitants.\nGLOBAL AND COMPETITIVE CITY\nDMQ citizens and authorities, based on a firm commitment to nature, will ensure not only its conservation but also its proper use.\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE CITY\nThe citizens will find conditions of high functional, spatial and formal quality throughout the DMQ territory which create an environment that ensures a better quality of life.\nCITY DESIGNED FOR LIFE\nThe urban structure and the decisions for the integral consolidation of the territory are based on the set of\npatrimonial, cultural and historical values.\nCITY THAT VALUES ITS CULTURE AND HISTORY\n3.2\tQUITO: RESILIENCE CONTEXT\nDue to its designation as Ecuador\u2019s capital city, its geographic position, and its tangible and intangible heritage, the DMQ has an economic, ecological, and cultural role to play on the world stage. Archaeological remains discovered at the foot of Mount Halo (at the El Inga site in the southeastern part of the city) show the existence of workshops that attest to the presence of human settlements in the area dating back at least 10,000 years (Lozano, 1991). Since that time and throughout its history, the city has been a mosaic of cultural diversity expressed through its traditions, art, and architecture. The population is settled along a horizontal strip surrounded by mountain ranges and high peaks, including Mount Pichincha and Mount Itchimbia. For many years, these high elevations contained urban sprawl. Within this plateau, the city has many faces, among them the Quito Historic City Center (QHCC), whose streets, squares, buildings, churches, convents, and monuments reflect a past that is connected to the present and needs to be preserved. Another face is modern Quito, a city driven to become a prosperous urban center while addressing structural inequalities.\nFrom a social perspective, Quito is a young city. Its demographics offers potential for significant economic development. The working age population (economically active) in the city is of higher proportion than the dependent population (children and senior citizens). If appropriately taken advantage of, the city\u2019s current age distribution is an opportunity to boost the city\u2019s economic engine and contribute to its socioeconomic growth. Additionally, the city\u2019s social capital is characterized by a long tradition of collaborative practices and participation in decision-making process required for planning the city\u2019s and its diverse communities\u2019 development (MDMQ, 2015). The DMQ\u2019s social fabric is highly dynamic, which is reflected in the city\u2019s history, initiatives, and notable ability for creativity and innovation. However, this historic strength has been affected by thesocial fragmentation caused by political factors, social differences, and thedynamicsofthe market, technology and urbanization. All of these have had corrosive effects on social cohesion and mobility (MDMQ, 2015).\nIn environmental terms, the city\u2019s diverse ecosystems are part of the planet\u2019s life support systems. Its territory contains immensely rich valleys and mountains as well as conservation corridors that are part of the Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena bioregion, one of the planet\u2019s biodiversity hotspots. As a result of their biological, cultural, and social assets, these areas meet the conditions needed for sustainable development opportunities in the DMQ. However, these areas are under pressure from practices that contribute to environmental degradation, such as mining, intensive livestock grazing, and overproduction of wood, which are affecting native forests and moorland. Urban expansion has also had a detrimental effect on the environmental and the city\u2019s ecology. All of these actions exacerbate the stresses on the different ecosystems, contaminate watersources and networks, and put the city\u2019s capacity to supply ecosystemic services at risk (MDMQ, 2015).\nMobility significantly influences the quality of life for city residents; its inefficient operation affects day-to-day activities. In the DMQ, inadequate mobility is one of the main chronic stresses, reflected mainly in the quality of service, measured by its accessibility, quality, and use of public places; transfer time, coverage, environmental impacts due to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and decline in air quality. The city\u2019s disorganized growth hinder the efforts of the municipality to address its citizens\u2019 demands for access to services, including transportation. The construction of the city\u2019s first metro line and its integration with existing mobility systems represent a historic opportunity to rethink urban development and its dynamics. A weak approach to capitalizing on this opportunity would reverse the city\u2019s potential for transformative action and worsen existing segregation and lack of coordination issues.\nFrom an economic standpoint, in addition to being an important financial center, the DMQ achieves high marks for education, human talent, infrastructure, and access to credit (MDMQ, 2015), all of which are significantly better than the rest of the country. Nevertheless, the lack of job opportunities is an underlying problem, which is often due to the lack of coordination between job-training efforts and the job market demands. The city has high concentrations of wealth and levels of inequality and informality, resulting in an economy that shows levels of employment and underemployment that are above the national average (INEC 2017). The economy is also vulnerable to factors such as the national dependence on oil prices and international markets for raw materials, especially in the case of theflower industry, the DMQ\u2019s main export. The need to strengthen the economy and diversify productive industries is closely related to the macroeconomics environment; in Ecuador\u2019s case, this is specifically related to dollarization. The absence of monetary management policy tools significantly reduces the ability to respond to external economic shocks.\nIn relation to land management, the city\u2019s unregulated growth affects itsfunctionality and increases its vulnerability to natural threats, such as earthquakes, landslides, and wildfires. The risk focal points in the territory are located in places vulnerable to both natural and man-made threats. The level of exposure is augmented by physical and socioeconomic factors. Given the city\u2019s topography, many informal settlements are located in areas with non-mitigable risk, such as slopes or gorges. Many of these areas do not have access to public utilities, infrastructure, and equipment, making them prone to violence and unsafe conditions. Given the demographic growth forecasted for these areas in the coming decades, the construction of safe habitat needs to be a priority.\n4. URBAN RESILIENCE\n\u201cUrban resilience refers to the ability of people, communities, companies and systems that form part of a city to survive, adapt, and grow regardless ofthe types of acute shocks and chronic stresses they experience.\u201d*\n-100 Resilient Cities\n*\u00abAcute shocks are sudden and intense events that threaten a city.\n\u2022 Chronic stresses weaken the fabric of a city on a daily or cyclical basis.\nPlanning for urban resilience requires an understanding of the systems and subsystems that make up the city and its surroundings. \u201cSocioecological systems\u201d referto environmental life support systems, which includes moorlands, mountains, forests and rivers; while \u201csociotechnological systems\u201d are related to infrastructure, mobility systems, and water or electrical supply (Meerow et aL, 2016). The interaction and interdependence between such systems generates synergies and clashes. The constantly changing dynamics of these systems require prepared responses and resilience structures that both support and depend on each other(Kristinsson,2012).\nIn a changingworld, cities and their populations need to adjust, recover quickly and come out stronger after acute shocks and stresses in their habitat. Building urban resilience does not mean returning to a previous or normal condition, lit is about developingthe capacity to prepare and adaptto change, and to\nbe able to continue functioning in a more effective and efficient way.\nCities have proven to be historically resilient. However, while the increasing size of the world\u2019s urban population offers opportunities to increase efficiency in access to services, economic opportunities, political participation and other areas, it also presents new challenges associated with scattered and informal settlements, environmental degradation, greater demand for resources, and increased inequality. This makes resilience a fundamental factor in guaranteeing the quality of life in cities. Given its importance, resilience principles are aligned with global agendas, such as the SDGs, which propose to eradicate poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of the 2030 agenda, the NUA, the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and the Sendai Frameworkfor Disaster Risk Reduction.\n24 I URBAN RESILIENCE |\n5.100 RESILIENT CITIES\nINITIATIVE\n100 Resilient Cities (100RC) - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of life in the 21st century. The 100RC initiative supports the cities in their efforts to adopt and incorporate resilience into their urban planning processes by providing access to forefront tools and technical assistance, as well as by channeling resources for action implementation. The 100RC Network receives this support through four mechanisms:\n1. Financial and logistical guidance for establishing an innovative new position in city government\u2014a Chief\nResilience Officer (CRO), who will lead the city\u2019s resilience efforts;\n2.SupportforaCRO to lead stakeholders in the development of a resilience-building strategy. This strategy, developed over the course of 6 to 9 months, will serve as the city\u2019s roadmap to resilience;\n3. Access to tools, service providers, and partners from the private, public, and non-profit sectors who can help cities develop and implement their resilience strategies. Current partners include data analysis companies, reinsurance companies, architects, energy experts, among others;\n4. Membership of the 100RC Network, through which CROs can share best practices, solve problems collectively, and learn from each other and from other resilience experts.\nThe Metropolitan District of Quito Municipality (MDMQ) has been part of this network since the first round, after being chosen from among more than 400 cities around the world. The development of the Resilient Quito Strategy underscores its commitment to building Quito\u2019s resilience and implementing concrete actions aimed at improving the city\u2019s capacity to adapt and thrive in the face of potential acute shocks and chronic stresses. The Quito Resilience Strategy followed the 100RC methodology and program\nguidelines, and was developed through a participatory process that included meetings and consultations with a wide variety of stakeholders from both the public and private sectors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and academia. The process has been enriched by the various perspectives, opinions, and sources of information.\nThe city\u2019s collaboration in this global program is an opportunity to share knowledge, techniques, and best practices in order to consolidate an urban vision that considers resilience in its development within the context of a global learning community.\n5.1 TOOLS AND APPROACH\nThe 100RC program provides cities with an established set of methodolgies and tools that can be adapted to each local context. The City Resilience Framework (CRF), developed by Arup with support from The Rockefeller Foundation, is a tool that helps cities explore the strengths and weaknesses of their systems in terms of four dimensions: Health and Well-being, Economy and Society, Infrastructure and Environment, and Leadership and Strategy.\nEach dimension contains three \u201cdrivers\u201d that subdivide into 12 components. TheCRFaims to providea uniform analysis framework for all cities that are part ofthe 100RC Network. The 100RC program uses several diagnostic tools based on theCRFin its work with cities to examine interdependencies and identify where they need to build theircapacities.\n5.2\tQUALITIES OF RESILIENT SYSTEMS\nUrban resilience qualities were defined as part ofthe development ofthe CRF. The following qualities determine how the systems proposed through the actions presented in this strategy address the possible acute impacts and chronic stresses, including the way in which they contribute to building resilience.\n1.\tReflective: learning from past experiences and incorporating the acquired knowledge to evaluate future decisions.\n2.\tRobust: implementing well-designed, built, and managed systems.\n3.\tInclusive: prioritizing citizen participation in decision making to establish mechanisms for arriving at appropriate public decisions.\n4.\tIntegrated: coordinating a wide range of systems and institutions to reach a goal.\n5.\tResourceful: considering alternative and innovative ways for using resources and find solutions.\n6.\tRedundant: purposely creating additional capacity to keep the city\u2019s operating systems going in the event of a failure or collapse.\n7.\tFlexible: systems capable of adapting to unforeseen changes that may arise in moments of risk, in critical situations, when data is lacking, or when new stakeholders are being included.\nPHASE 1. Preliminary Resilience Assessment- Discovery Areas\nThis phase consists of a preliminary comprehensive diagnosis of the city, which is used as a basis to identify the areas where efforts need to be made to build a resilient city. In addition, a Resilience Steering Committee is created within local government, identifying important stakeholders to successfully develop and implementthe strategy.\nPHASE 2. Development of the Resilience Strategy\nBased on the shocks and stresses identified in Phase 1, the strategy establishes specific actions to be implemented by the local government and other key players to strengthen different systems. This phase delves into the issues identified in Phase 1 through a process that includes stakeholders and teams throughout the city, platform partners, and other cities within the network. Subsequently, actions, teams, and partnerships with new stakeholders are presented to contribute and validate the processofbuilding the city's resilience. This phase concludes by publishing a roadmap to resilience.\nPHASE 3.\nImplementation of the Resilience Strategy\nDuring this phase, the activities established in the Resilience Strategy are implemented and monitored, together with the stakeholders identified in the first two phases.\n6. PROBLEM STATEMENT\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES\nGiven that cities a re the sum of several interdependent systems, their problems require multidimensional solutions. This is why building urban resilience is fundamental to achieving robust, sustainable and inclusive cities.\nThe 2.6 million inhabitants of the DMQ are exposed to a wide range of acute shocks and chronic stresses. According to the results from the tools used in the first phase to produce the PRA, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and economic crises are dominant. However, there are other, smaller-magnitude and more frequent shocks like floods or forest fires. The vulnerable population is concentrated in critical areas, which exacerbates theirexposure to threats and amplifies the impact an event may have.\nAt the same time, the city\u2019s functioning continues to be affected by chronic stresses. The most relevant are social exclusion,\nenvironmental degradation, lack of an efficient transportation system, and lack of a diversified economy that provides job opportunities. These issues mainly harm the most vulnerable sectors of the population.\nHowever,thereareanumberoffactorsthatcontributeto building the city\u2019s resilience. One of these is the age demographic, which offers favorable conditions for the economy. Natural areas that are part of the urban and peripheral habitat constitute life support systems with wide-ranging positive effects on the population\u2019s quality of life. Infrastructure projects rethink the approach to sustainable urban development and contribute to efficient mobility, while the city\u2019s social structures allow the consolidation of containment networks and disaster response and preparation actions. This last factor also involves citizen co-responsibility plans that enhance the ability to manage and validate public participation development agendas.\n7. STRATEGY\nSocial, economic, and environmental issues are present throughout the DMQ. Therefore, the Quito Resilience Strategy should be applied in such a way that its pillars and actions work hand in hand. For example, the issues of traffic and air pollution are best addressed by applying various actionsfrom all pillars. A first step in theshortterm might be to encourage citizens to use low-emission public transportation and adopt active mobility mechanisms (e.g., publie bicycles). A complementary step is to im prove public space with nature-based solutions that improve environmental quality and promote the use of public spaces. These improvements could include components that help increase citizen safety and foster a culture of mass transit system use. In the long term, planning and developing a compact city with a wide range of uses and services would help to reduce the number of trips, trip distances, and dependence on private vehicles while boosting the local economy. Replacing cars with nonemission vehicles is an important strategy, but it is not realistic to expect that citizens will switch to non-emission vehicles or stop using cars in favor of mass transit in the short or medium term. Therefore, problems may continue to appear in different ways, causing other unintended shocks, which is why the actions taken should be reviewed periodically.\nThe Chakana is an important polysemic symbol of several Andean cultures. This geometric figure was used as a guidelinefor mathematical, philosophical, social, and religious concepts. The Chakana also symbolizes the relation of man to the cosmos, being the object of a millenary cult by offering the \u201corder\u201d and the \u201cmeasure\u201d. This symbol collects the concepts behind each of the pillars of the resilience strategy and unifies them under a single objective: \u201cbalance\u201d.\nThe Quito Resilience Strategy has been developed in collaboration with AECOM, the strategy partner provided by 100 Resilient Cities.\n7.1 STRATEGIC APPROACH TO BUILDING A RESILIENT CITY\nPeople constitute the basis of this strategy to make the DMQ resilient. The starting point is to create the ability to plan the development of neighborhoods, communities, and the city in general in a participatory manner. This mechanism aims to strengthen social cohesion and promote self-organization (Peterson et aL, 2005), which, in turn, strengthens the city\u2019s ability to cope with, recover from, and stand stronger against potential acute shocks and chronic stresses. This strategy takes into account the willingness of Quito\u2019s residents to share or participate in planning and decision making; based on this interest, the proposal seeks to create an environment that builds social institutions and, in turn, the capacities associated with human development (Stewart, 2013).\nIn this sense, citizen participation becomes a vehicle to engage the strategy\u2019s various pilla rs. The actions identified will facilitate participatory processes that should be accompanied by other processes focused on strengthening the ability of communities to organize and empower themselves. At the same time, the Municipality must strengthen its receptiveness to demands coming from society while furthering its own participation in them.\nEffective environmental conservation and management mechanisms, based on participatory processes, arefundamental to building urban resilience. Resourceful management requires that those who benefit directly and are related to local natural resources get involved in the planning and management of the use of such resources (Ingles et aL, 1999). Given the importance of the Metropolitan District of Quito\u2019s natural heritage, conservation of such areas fosteringthe provision of ecosystem services (such as air quality improvement, water supply, temperature regulation, or recreational experiences such as scenic walks) are not only urgently needed, but also provide an opportunity foreconomicdevelopmentfor people living in such areas.\nUrban areas have replaced many previously existing ecosystems, thereby changing natural dynamics (UN Habitat, 2015). This trend should be redirected through solutions that prioritize environmental care. This strategy sets out the idea\nof maximizing ecosystem services while decreasing their demand, which is reflected in GHGs, water consumption, and waste. The proposal also focuses on generating environmental consciousness among citizens to increase the effectiveness of such efforts.\nUrban, periphery, and rural areas depend on the economic and social dynamics of their environment. A decisive part of this context is mobility, one of the greatest sources of pollution in the Metropolitan District of Quito. The search for zero- or low-carbon alternatives, such as the Quito Metro, is crucial to reducing demands on the environment, and these alternatives contribute to the city\u2019s sustainable development.\nSuch infrastructure projects also have a positive economic effect. They offeropportunities to take advantage ofthe benefits of the economies of agglomeration, related to the benefits that companies obtain by locating near each other, and to provide adequate and available housing in safe areas with the necessary infrastructure. This helps to decrease existing risk and avoid the generation of new risk. By these means a compact, integrated, and low-emission urban growth is proposed.\nThe proposed urban development has the potential to generate employment for the DMQ\u2019s human capital. To fulfill this potential, productive agendas should be fostered to create decent, high-quality job opportunities and bridge the knowledge and skill gaps between human capital and the productive sector. Promoting innovation and entrepreneurship from a sustainability perspective complements this potential. This approach highlights proposals that contemplate an added value, such ascirculareconomyorurban agriculture, as part of a broader understanding ofthe food system. Such proposals not only focus on economic production, but also strengthen food security. The goal is to create resilient economies that have the ability to recover from possible acute shocks and an economic evironment that allows for an ongoing diversification of sectors.\nQuito\u2019s economy is characterized by deep inequalities. Thus, one portion of the city\u2019s residents have an exaggerated exposure to the risks associated with their socio-economic\ncondition. Building a safer city requires planning and taking actions to reduce physical vulnerability. Decreasing risk means that natural and man-made threats need to be identified and integrated into local planning. Thus, strengthening urban development regulations includes mitigating existing risks, avoiding the creation of new risks, and even considering relocation processes when necessary.\nBuilding resilience needs to be an ongoing process; therefore, the principles need to be embedded in the city\u2019s planning and administration. Its multidimensional aspects require sustained analysis and follow-up with the aim to re-evaluate approaches and renew commitments. This multidimensional characteristic is defined by the ability to build networks and interaction between different stakeholders, making it possible to develop and reconfigure proposals in an ongoing search for effective results.\nE\tThe provision of housing in safe and adequate places helps to deconcentrate\nthe risk located in the outskirts ofthe city and provides adequate conditions and services to improve the quality of life.\nD\nA sustainable and resilient transportation system ensures the efficient functionality of the city. At the same time it reduces the demand for ecosystem services.\nC\nThe DMQ\u2019s natural heritage and natural resources provide conditions of life supportand a development opportunity for the city.\nB The strengthening of the social capital by taking advantage of the great human diversity located in the urban centralities ensures that Quito residents can effectively face any adverse situations, through collective action.\nA\nThe location of the DMQ presents a great geographical variety that offers diverse landscapes. At the same time it presents challenges that must be faced when planning and managing urban development.\n7.3 HOW TO READ THE STRATEGY\nThe strategy is constituted of 5 pillars, 16 goals, and 64 actions. They are defined throughout this strategy and are the result ofthe analysis ofthe discovery areas established in the Preliminary Resilience Assessment and the activities outlined Scope of Work during Phase 2.\nEach pillar includes a problem statement and the current framework within which the strategy has been developed. Next, goals for each pillar are defined and from there actions are proposed. Here, the platform partners who have collaborated on assessment and technical advice in developing each of the pillars are identified. The cities in the 100RC Network that have inspired the proposal are also identified.\nEach pillar details actions or projects that are local, international or within the 100RC Network that have served as inspiration. It also describes platform partners that have been building resilience or have had a major influence on developing goals and actions in the strategy. The discussion of each pillar highlights the contribution, creativity, influence, or similarity of these actions or projects and compares them with the actions of the Metropolitan District of Quito Resilience Strategy.\nThe following details are provided for each action: a description, the type, status , implementation timeline, owners, other implementation partners, and how it relates to other goals ofthe strategy. A set of performance indicators is presented that makes it possible to measure implementation. Impact indicators, PMDOT alignment, and contribution to the SDGs are discussed in the appendices at the end of document.\n40 I STRATEGY|\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nThe city\u2019s accelerated and unplanned growth creates challenges, including lack of integration and social cohesion. The Metropolitan District of Quito has a fragmented and weak social fabric, with minimal public empowerment. This is partly due to the poor application of social participation tools, loss of community ties, and low citizen initiative and commitment.\nEffective land managementrequiresintegrated and participatory planning and administrative processes. Strengthening the social fabric and encouraging citizen participation are crucial factors for these processes. In turn, these processes require promoting actions that include stakeholder meetings to facilitate work with neighborhoods or communities, identifying groups of people in vulnerable situations, creating places for citizens to meet up and promote cohesive communities, and applying public policies that focus on reducing existing gaps (MDGQ, 2015).\nParticipatory policies must recognize citizen needs and the significant social diversity, while facilitating collaborative processes in an inclusive manner. The city has sufficient social capital to build solid institutions while the municipal administration has developed mechanisnms to facilitate the process. However, the dynamics that are key to an effective citizen participation have not always come together as required. The Metropolitan District of Quito has more than 2000\nneighborhoods, however only 189 have established assemblies. This indicates a still-developing participatory agenda, resulting in a large majority of the population, which includes vulnerable groups, with no representation.\nCitizen participation is based on the ability of communities and citizens to self-manage, coupled with the receptive attitude of the city\u2019s institutions. The Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito has been making changes to its management model to adopt this definition of participatory policies. These changes, which include tools and social programs, along with a closer relationship and openness with its citizens, need to be further reinforced. A government that has a close relationship with its citizens needs to make connections with key social players when making decisions, and promote consultations and participatory mechanisms during the entire lifecycle of local public policies.\nParticipatory democracy not only validates the work of public administration, but also strengthens and provides feedback on responsiveness and reaction abilities in the face of acute shocks and chronic stresses. The goal of promoting citizen representation in local administration contributes to form an environment that facilitates co-responsibility between citizens and the Municipality by democratizing decision making for inclusive development.\nAl.l\nCapacity strengthening program to enable effective citizen participation\nSTATUS:\nPre-exictinp\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNER: Biepaitmentof Territorial Coordination and Citizen Participation\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS: Private trainerz neipbiborbiood aezembliep cTudentz\nNETWORK OF CITIES: BocPop Bybloc, Mexico City, Pittcburpbi\nDESCRIPTION\nConsists of a citizen training program with four strategic categories: leadership, strategic-planning,, entrepreneurship, arid participation in citizen assemblies.

These areas are characterized by a diverse topography and a variety of climates; they consist of 120,000 hectares (ha) of rainforests in the western part, 47,000 ha of bushes and dry forests in the Guayllabam ba basin; 45,000 ha of gorges and intervened areas, and 45,000 ha of paramo (andean moor) which appear at 3,600 meters (m) above sea level (Environment Department, 2016). This natural heritage is the city\u2019s backbone, and its future seems prosperous given that close to 40 percent of the territory is protected by a variety of legal instruments to safeguard its high environmental value. There is urgency to properly manage this natural heritage, based on the relation communities - natural areas, becomes a critical need since our quality of life depends on that.\nThe city\u2019s agricultural production systems, which take up 119,366 ha (28.2 percent of the area of the metropolitan district) produce a wide variety of products, including food, flowers, commercial forests, and aquaculture (Environment Department, 2016). While the Metropolitan District of Quito\u2019s\nrich ecosystems significantly contribute to the city\u2019s habitat and economic production, ecological management should focus on reducing the pressure affecting them. However, above all, actions should be focused on avoiding the loss of these areas and their biodiversity, as they provide important services such as water, air, and carbon sequestration capacity, to name a few. Valuing ecosystem services allows us to not only obtain resources but also propose participatory mechanisms for managing and administering such areas.\nAt the urban level, environmental degradation and physical vulnerability are underlying problems. When the city\u2019s planning and design take nature and its benefits into account, it is possible to find solutions with positive outcomes. One clear advantage of nature\u2019s presence in cities is air pollution reduction; improved airquality also contributes to reducing urban heat island effect and creates micro-climates that encourage prolonged use of public areas (TNC, 2016). If they are correctly implemented, nature-based solutions can also help improve conditions involving physical vulnerabilities,\nBl.l\nManagement program to conserve natural and semi-natural areas\nSTATUS:\nAspirational\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNER: Environment Department\nNETWORK OF CITIES: Durban, Santa Fe, Mexico City, Melbourne, Exjulcler\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERSHIP\nSDPYC, ConQuito, Department of Territory, Habitat and Housinp (STHV), SGCTyFC\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS:\n-\tMonopement model deslpned and Implemented\n-\tNumber of bee tares, manaped under the models.\nDESCRIPTION\nOne of the 21st century\u2019s defining challenges is to improve the ability to manage complex and changing social and ecological systems.

This phenomenon, in some cases resulting from unregulated land use, has resulted in approximately 180,000 people (about 7 percent ofthe population) living in unregulated communities as of 2014 (MDGM, 2015). The pace at which these settlements are occurring exceeds the city\u2019s ability to plan its urban development and has caused expansion of the urban footprint beyond the initial model of a \u201ccompact central city\u201d into an expansive and uncoordinated city. Today, the Metropolitan District of Quito has a low-density structure that is scattered, segregated, not very compact, and dysfunctional (MDMQ, 2015). Thus, homes are in places that are increasingly far from the central city, but employment and services are still mainly concentrated (54 percent) in the main central area (8 out of the 65 DMQ parish centers) (City Institute, 2015).\nThis situation leads to serious problems involving mobility, accessibility, and the provision of services, all of which affect the city\u2019s efficient functioning and, therefore, the quality of life for Quito residents. Controlling this growth, and planning an appropriate type of development is an important alternative available to reduce social and land inequality. A well-planned and managed land\nPhoto: Miguel Paez, Drones Creativity EC\nresults in sustainable and efficient urban, social, and productive growth leading to appropriate population and economic distribution (MDMQ, 2015). Planning for this type of development should include areas with greater density, urban quality, and safety. The plan should also provide for greater diversity in land use. The objective is to leverage the vitality generated by an integrated mass transportation system while also promoting alternatives such as walking and bicycling (The World Bank, 2013), and providing an incentive to the real estate market around the transportation system to support the city\u2019s progress.\nAccording to the city\u2019s Environmental Department, transportation generates the greatest amount of CO2 emissions (56 percent) in the city (2,902,402 tons of CO2 per year) (2016), and its operation affects both urban environ mental conditions and the health of Quito residents. For this reason the city requires mobility alternatives that contribute to reducing the carbon footprint and improving environmental quality, while coping with the possible effects of climate change and other natural hazards. The first Quito Metro line, as the main spine ofthe city\u2019s mobility system, enables the generation of environmentally friendly alternatives that contribute to sustainable development and build resilience towards the year 2040.\nCommunity territorial control program in hillside areas\nSTATUS:\nAspirational\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNER: Department of Territorial Coordination and Citizen Fartiedpation\nNETWORK OF CITIES: Mexico City, Medellin\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS:\nZonal administrations, CTHV, Ceneral CCCyC communities,\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS:\n-\tDeslpned and Implemented mechanisms,\n-\tNumber of projects, co-manaped betvi\/een the Munlclpelityend the community In the Identified ureus.\nDESCRIPTION\nControlling tire city boundaiy helps to prevent urban sprawl.

Settlements in blase areas are more vulnerable to natural disasters, litre landslides and floods, and also deteriorate the environment due to unplanned and uncontrolled expansion of urban sprawl. The initiative focuses on two strategies: (1) anticipating settlements and (2) mitigating existing rislr.\nThe anticipation strategy consists of analyzing the land to identify areas that are inclined to be occupied by informal settlements, This effort is then followed by settlement discouragement through environmental restoration, sustainable forestry, nature trails, paries, or urban agriculture in the identified aieas, It also redirects growth to areas thiat are more appropriate for human settlements, This redirection is done by providing facilities, public, utilities, public, paries, etc.,, to make the areas more attractive.\nThe mitigation strategy focuses on actions that reduce risk and improve the quality of life in communities that are already occupying hillside slopes, This strategy involves slope stabilization using bio-engineering, sustainable water and solid waste management, and resettlement of high-risk dwellings,\nThe project uses a community model in which citizen participation is bey for its success, Social involvement includes communication, training, and awareness programs for the communities to become allies and co-manage the areas where they live.\nUrban and urban periphery economic dynamics of land use\nstudy\nC1.2\nSTATUS:\nAspirational\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNERlPepaffmenf of Territory, Habitat and Houitna\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS: SA\nSDPyC, ConQuito\nNETWORK OF CITIES: Bybloc\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS:\n-\tStudy of the ope ration of land markete.\n-\tDeotpn and implementation of land me manapernent pool Idee.\nDESCRIPTION\nThe strong pressure to charge the use of urban periphery and rural land areas requires a oornprehensive u riderstaridins of the phenomenon, with aoouiate and systernatio information about the land market.

When implemented with an equitable vision, TOD is a robust strategy that enhianc.es the benefits associated with urban development for the city\u2019s different groups (Suzula et ah, 2013).\nInternational Benchmark: El Pedregal, TOD in Bogota\nThe Transrnilenio transportation system was implemented in Bogota in the year 2000, and today it is one of the world\u2019s top bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, With 110 kilometers (drrrt) of exclusive lanes, 138 stops, nine terminals, and a fleet of 2,207 buses, the system transports more than 2.4 million passengers per day, making it the most used BRT in flue world. In Bogota, public transportation accounts for 41 percent of all daily trips made.\nEl Pedregal is a BRT station located where two) major city roads cross: Seventh Avenue, flue most important stieet in Bogota, with: stores, institutions, and universities, and 100th Stieet, which connects flue city business center to flue western part of flue city and flue airport. There are plans to expand the Transmilenio to include BRT lanes on both streets, thus increasing public transportation arrivals at the station. The Bogota Land Use Plan identified El Pedregal as a possible site for urban revival because of its location next to the city\u2019s financial center, its low population density, and its small number of landowners,\nThe planning agency has established that development will follow a SAP (Small Aiea Plan), which is the legal concept used to design districts or neighborhoods as either new developments or renovation projects, The SAP can be promoted by the public or private sector, provided that a successful public consultation process is carried out before the plan\u2019s approval. By law, a SAP must meet certain requirements essential to urban design. For example, at least 17 percent ofthe plan area needs to be set aside for public use. To increase population density and take advantage of available space, the developer is required to either pay for or provide public assets lube roads, schools, or, in this case, a public transit station.\nThe El Pedregal Partial Plan was adopted in 2015. Aldea Pioyectos, a private company with: experience on similar projects in Bogota, was chosen to manage the development preject. Commercial towers and a transit hub aie already under construction, and the estimated completion date for the project is 2020.

Urban environment quality is key to enc.ou iaging people to choose wallsng over d ri vi ng (Southworth, 2005).\nC4.1.1\nPilot project to transform the Quito Historic City Center into a pedestrian area\nSTATUS:\nPre-exlctlnp\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNER: Metropolitan Herltope institute\nNETWORK OF CITIES: Mexico City\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS: SM,\nSTHV, Quito Metro, SA\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS:\n-\tPilot implementation\n-\tidcercptlcfpctlon curvey\nDESCRIPTION\nh the Quito Historic City Center, about 72 percent of residents and visitors move aiound by public transportation and on foot. This characteristic is both a strength and a burden that must be managed when seeking, resilience, socioeconomic urban development, and improvement of habitability. The IMP is working to design and implement a plan to transform part of the Quito Historic City Center into a pedestrian aiea. An eight-stage pilot program has been planned; the fimt stage involves Garcia Moreno Street between Olrnedo and Bolivar Streets, Chiile Street between Eenalcazar arid Irnbabura Streets, arid Venezuela Street between Chiile arid Espejo Streets,\nRESILIENCE DIVIDEND\nDifferent analyses indicate that people living in walkable neighborhoods have higher levels of social capital compared to those living in the car-orierited suburbs, Tlaese types of proposals riot only create a greater probability of getting to know neighbors, participating iri politics, trusting others, arid being socially committed (Leyden, 2003), but also laelps boost tine local economy.\nC4.2\nProgram to encourage the use of public and private bicycles\nSTATUS:\nAcptrattonal\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNER: Metropolitan Public Corn pony of Mobil it,\/ and Public World\nNETWORK OF CITIES: Mexico City Cuntlupo, Thecexilontkt\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS: Quito Metro, CTHVCA, CM\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS:\n-\tDecipned and implemented propram\n-\tNumber of public bicycle ucerc\nDESCRIPTION\nThe use of bicycles will be promoted through public-private partnerships in which users of this means of transport receive various benefits from sponsoring companies (e.g,, access to promotional products) or their employers, The Municipality provides areas for advertisement, infrastructure, arid bicycle parking lots; develops arid coordinates the program; arid provides conditions to encourage bicycle use. The maintenance of bicycle lares, signage, road education, arid strengthening the public bicycle program that already operates in the city are all important basics to encourage the use of private bicycles,\nRESILIENCE DIVIDEND\nPromoting a change of the transportation culture in the city requires a major effort that demands support from private stakeholders who could offer incentives for bicycle use. This change would receive the support of urban cyclist groups and organizations that seek to encourage bicycle use by the general public. This action reduces vehicle congestion, improves air quality, activates the use of public areas, and therefore, has a significant impact on the health of city residents (Libman, 2004).\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nIn socioeconomic terms, demographic distribution is one of Quito\u2019s most important characteristics: half of the population is under 29 years old. When analyzing this we found that one out of four in habitants is between age 30 and 49 (27 percent), and a similar number (28 percent) is between age 15 and 29, making these two the most prevalent age cohorts, alongside that of children and adolescents under the age of 14 (27 percent) (PMDOT 2015-2025 (I), MDMQ). This situation is particularly important in the construction of long-term resilience, since the population\u2019s age structure is expected to change in the coming decades (a reduction in the number of children and an increase in older adults). This change will mean a smallerworking population contributing to production, with increased pressure on the social security system for the elderly.\nAlthough the Metropolitan District of Quito is prosperous, it is at the same time sensitive to external economic factors such as the price of oil. The DMQ produces 23 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP), the highest of any city in Ecuador (MDMQ, 2015). However, it is a city where wealth is concentrated. In the Metropolitan District of Quito, there are 101,937 economic establishments (according to the 2010 Economic Census), most of which are microenterprises (89 percent). These establishments account for 2.3 percent of total sales and 36 percent of employment. Though only 1 percent of businesses are large companies, they represent 88.2 percent of sales and employ 32 percent of the workforce (MDMQ, 2015). Efforts to achieve greater inclusion of the population are affected by the gap between the available human capital and the needs of the productive sector. Knowledge about these aspects makes\n84 I STRATEGY| PILLAR D\nit possible to develop mechanisms to prepare the potential workforce.\nEven though Quito is the city with the highest concentration of technology in the country, its investment in business innovation and research is incredibly low compared to other Latin American cities. Of the total number of companies, only 1.1 percent invest in research and development, and this investment is concentrated in the large companies (PMDOT 2015-2025 (ii), MDMQ). From this perspective, programs that promote sustainability principles should encourage investment in innovation to increase economic diversity in the productive sector. These programs could also take advantage of the entrepreneurial vocation of Quito, evidenced by the 31,812 establishments created in 2009 and 2010, 55 percent of which report sales of less than $USD 9,999 per year (according to Economic Census 2010, quoted in MDMQ 2015). The goal is to foster and allow ongoing commercial diversification with an inclusion and environmental sustainability focus.\nLooking through the lens of inclusion, a clear example of economic diversification is found in efforts that have been made by the Municipality to develop the Urban Farming Program. However, the city produces only 5 percent of its food requirement, and itsfood system is highly vulnerable to weather and seismic and volcanic events (RUAF, 2017). Thus, support for programs like the Urban Vegetable Gardens and the development of the food economy not only makes it possible to give boost vulnerable socio-economic sectors, but also works toward achieving food security.\nDl.l\nPrioritization of productive sectors in Quito based on creation of qualityjobs study\nSTATUS:\nPrp-pxfpPfnp\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNER: Depaitmentof Compptftfvpnpox omol Fmoluctfvp Dpvpfopmpnt\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS: \/ Q\nConQufbx pilvpitp ppcPjr, pufPJo, ESP univpipjtipp.\nNETWORK OF CITIES: Soifo\/i Epmoronp\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS:\n-\tComplptppl ptuply\n-\tNumbpr ofpmpixitrx omd projpcE Eat push for fndupjvp cmol oiuoifftyjoto.\nDESCRIPTION\nThe action begin.;-, by identifying the potential of the city\u2019s diverse productive sectors using an inclusive development approach.

Diversification stimulates competitiveness among different sectors arid works to foster the value chain proposed in the competitiveness agenda. This project is based on integration, which seeks out synergies between sectors arid strategic actions associated with entrepreneurship arid the well-being of vulnerable groups,\nInspiration from the 100RC network:\nPromotion of circulareconorny in Rio de Janeiro\nToday, consumption arid production patterns follow a linear model of extraction, use, arid elimination. On the ore hand, we have greater demand for raw materials, leading to associated environmental impacts, On the other hand, more arid more waste is being generated, arid with that issues related to its transportation arid disposal arise. To counter this issue, Rio deJareiro, as part of its resilience strategy, has proposed \u201cpromoting an inclusive, diversified, low-carbon circular economy,\u201d with two main initiatives: (1) create an agency to promote a circular economy in the city arid (2) give value to solid arid organic waste. These actions seek to empower citizens thiroughi job creation arid support the city\u2019s efforts to mitigate arid adapt to the effects of climate change.\nThere are three main objectives behind creating a municipal agency for this project: (1) to reduce waste sent to landfills, (2) to create jobs by giving value to waste, arid\n(3) to foster efficient use of resources to create a circular economic model. In a circular economy products are developed fairing into consideration their useful life, reuse, recycling, arid transformation of the materials so that \u201cbusiness ecosystems\u201d can be developed. In this ecosystems the waste generated by one industry is used as raw materials by a ri other.\nBy assigriirigvalue to solid waste, civil society becomes more involved in the circular economy, with the agency\u2019s support. Mini-recycling arid composting centers are created as gathering points, giving value to and exchanging solid arid organic waste.

Some of the characteristics of the food system increase its vulnerability; among these aim its dependency on the imported food (approximately 85 percent of food is imported), weak distribution systems, arid isolated communities, After analysis of its different components, including vulnerabilities, threats, strengths, arid potential, an action plan is proposed to influence the final availability arid accessibility of varied arid nutritious food products, This action also seeks to influence consumers\u2019 ability to choose healthy diets by providing nutrition arid health education thuoughi policies, incentives, arid appropriate governance.\nRESILIENCE DIVIDEND\nFood policy will be of great importance to economic development efforts over the coming decades (Tirnmer arid Pearson, 1985). Food challenges must be adequately analyzed to be solved. This type of analysis is a complex task that entails having a long-term vision on know the food system can evolve arid become a social arid economic asset for the city. To the extent tlaat the food system becomes an asset, it riot only helps to strengthen Quito\u2019s socio-economic fabric, but also contributes to the city\u2019s development efforts by supporting a healthy population arid making it less vulnerable to possible acute shocks (RUAF, 2017).\nD3.2\nStrengthen the urban agriculture program in Quito\nSTATUS:\nPrp-pxfcdnp\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNER: Depaitmentof Compptftfvpnpii and F'rodudfvp Dpvptopmpnt\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS:\nCoriCydto, cornu ddad\nNETWORK OF CITIES: Amman, Loc Anpplpp Mew Ortpam, Pane, Santa Fp, Spmaranp\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS:\n-\tDpvploppcl and fmplpmpntpd mpehaniimt\n-\tTom of food producpd\n-\tNumbpr ofppopfp paitfdpatfnp in urban apneufturp\n-\tErtpridon ofpardpm\nDESCRIPTION\nDeveloping agricultural practice;, in tine Metropolitan District of Quito fra; environmental economic, and social dimensions, This program develops from a characteristic that is unique to the ancient Ecuadorian Andean population and its connection to agriculture.

This initiative facilitates improvement in the access, availability arid quality of the food consumed, arid males food an important source of income arid savings for its. participants, It is currently applied as a Metropolitan District of Quito sustainability indicator, arid its practice contributes to reducing food system vulnerability.\nAGRUPAR promotes organic production based on agricultural, ecology, small species, breeding , direct sale of production surpluses, economic arid social inclusion of vulnerable sectors, arid promotion of responsible consumption, with emphasis on local, freshi, diversified, hea I thy, arid nutritious food.\nThe project provides, training arid follow-up assistance for agriculture arid food processirigfor approximately 1,300 gardens (domestic gardens, community centers, arid schools arid with seivices for disabled people, chi Id reri under 5 years old, senior citizens, refugees, immigrants, arid other groups), where 84 percent of participants are women. AGRUPAR has 17 weekly bio-rnarlets for direct sale of production surpluses, where over 105 t\/pes of crops are sold, generating revenue of $USD 300,200 (in 2016, the bio-rnarlet represented 25 percent of the farm\u2019s total sales.). It has been estimated that 47 percent of production is sold arid 53 percent is consumed by the cultivators, The project is found in 97 percent of urban pa rishes a rid 91 percent of rural parishes, occupying more than 30 ha.\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nQuito, tucked within the slopes of Mount Pichincha on top of several geological faults, is continually threatened by at least five types of acute shocks: landslides, intense rainfall, volcanic eruptions, seismic movements, and forest fires (by natural or man-made causes) (Atlas of Threats, 2015). Quito\u2019s location, its high level of exposure to these threats and physical and socioeconomic vulnerabilities, create concentrated risk zones throughouttheterritory.Aseriesof legal instruments contained within a broad legalframeworkfor risk management in Ecuador -atthe national level-, orthe Metropolitan Ordinancethat creates the Metropolitan System of Comprehensive Risk Management for the Metropolitan District of Quito -at the local level-, establish preventative actions and regulations for the various levels of government in theeventof a disaster, depending on its magnitude. However, these regulations must be accompanied by clear prevention and risk reduction mechanisms. With this aim, the Municipality ofthe Metropolitan District of Quito needs to incorporate the scope of risk in its planning and territorial management. Likewise, it is important for the city to motivate and prepare its citizens to become involved in efforts to prevent and reduce vulnerabilities.\nNo study accurately shows or quantifies the number of informal structures. However, according to statements by various municipal technicians, approximately 60 percent of construction in the Metropolitan District is informal (MDMQ, 2015). The sheer size of the territory and the limited ability to provide control make it difficult to stop this trend, as does the lack of enforcement of specific building regulationsforthe DMQ. The seismic threat and the particular types of soils found in the city makes this issue one ofthe city\u2019s greatest weaknesses. The lackof a compliance culture worsensthis problem. Thissituation results from a set of factors related to poverty, migration, and lackof accessible information and affordable technical advising services for low-income families. The Municipality\u2019s efforts to recognize large informal settlements (MDMQ, 2015) should be complemented by a detailed analysis ofthe physical status of the buildings and the land itself to modify, reinforce, or relocate settlements in protected and high-risk areas or places without proper infrastructure (M DMQ, 2015).\nLikewise, properly preparingforthreats makes it possibleforthe population to recover faster after being affected by a disaster. To this end, it is important to ensure effective neighborhood organization and enhance the natural desire of Quito residents to help each other out. Efforts to avoid new risks and reduce existing ones make it possible to transfer risk through insurance on existing buildings at an affordable cost. This approach will make financial resources available to achieve effective and inclusive recovery when needed.\nEl.l\nStrengthen the Metropolitan Information System (SIM) with a City Risk Index to aid in decision making\nSTATUS:\nUndemay\nTIMELINE:\nACTION OWNER: General PDannlnci Department\nIMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS: GGGgG,\nGTHV, ICGi\nNETWORK OF CITIES: Amman, Berkley, Mexico City Banttaqo, Dernaranq, Toyama\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS:\n-\tPlatform Implemented\n-\tNurnherof pointe ofaccecc, to theplakorm\nDESCRIPTION\nri a city where risk varies and is not evenly distributed, information must be available to evaluate the most vuinerable arid most exposed areas so that actions can be prioritized.

These community builders will receive advising, by professionals who, armed witla manuals for different construction types and materials, will guide these processes in a coordinated way.\nRESILIENCE DIVIDEND\nThis action helps reduce the existing lisb arid supports processes to identify buildirips in the city. Strengthening existirig structures before a disaster affects hiurnari safety arid aids in the rapid repair of existi rig unsafe buildirips, This practice, in turn, mates it possible for displaced people to return to their homes after an extreme irn pact (Build Charge arid Swisscoritact, 2015). Participative structural reinforcement is a preventive action based on best practices, By irivolvirip different stabeholders iri the real estate industry, more assistance is available, along, with community collaboration.\n100RC PLATFORM PARTNER: BUILD CHANGE LATIN AMERICA\nBuild C Mange, one of the 100RC Network platform partners, is an oraanizaflora whose mission foouses on savins lives in developing countries during earthquakes, arid typhoons by reinforcing homes or schools that are in risk of collapse. Build Change designs disaster-resistant homes, arid schools arid trains builders, owners, engineers, arid government employees, on proper construction. The program is carried out ira close contact witla its beneficiaries, making them part of both the decision-making arid construction processes. The result is a lasting change in construction practices, by developing abilities, for the local population.\nSome strategies that Build change uses in its projects, are adopting local solutions to determine the most profitable construction models, empowering homeowners who design their houses, participating ira production processes, taking advantage\nof knowledge arid technology developed around the world (technical excellence), purchasing available materials (economic growth for the community), creating jobs for local construction workers, arid em.laarigirig knowledge witla other post-disaster construction agencies.\nri Latin America, Build change laas worked in countries such as Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador, arid Colombia. In Colombia, both the Bogota arid the Medellin Mayor\u2019s. Offices, have recognized the importance of involvement as key to improving home construction.

MONITORING: METHODOLOGY\nBeyond the management indicators proposed to monitor each action, the effective implementation of the DMQ Resilience Strategy requires a permanent process of monitoring and follow-up of the strategy\u2019s achievements and reach. To accomplish this, a system of indicators able to monito impact articulated with the pillars and goals ofthe strategy, the Metropolitan Plan for Development and Land Management (PMDOT), the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and the New Urban Agenda (NAU) is established.\nThe design ofthe indicators is based on a multidimensional approach that identified cross-disciplinary support points to ensure a comprehensive strategy. It should be noted that implementation of the strategy does not focus on a single theme, but incorporates a systems approach through synergies between actions. Within the strategy, the correlation between these actions through the goals is not only addressed within each pillar, but between the goals of all pillars\u2014an exercise that enables contributions to other pillars simultaneously. As a second step, a contribution and correlation analysis was carried out with the objectives and goals ofthe PMDOT.\nSubsequently, the contribution of the Resilience Strategy to achieve the SDG was supported by the memorandum of understanding signed between the Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito and the United Nations Development Program in Ecuador for the implementation of the SDG and NAU in the city. From this agreement, a process has begun to align local planning and management goals with global agendas. Within this framework, a specific diagnosis was made of the level of alignment of the PMDOT with Agenda 2030 (SDG). The Rapid Integrated Assessment (RIA) methodology developed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been used to help countries and cities assess their level of preparedness for the implementation of the United Nations SDGs. The\nresult of this assessment has made it possible to identify the existing relationships between PMDOT policies and objectives and SDG goals and targets. These will serve as a basis for a proposal to align the PMDOT with Agenda 2030 and the SDG.\nThis assessment also serves as a basis for the design of an array of impact indicators that can contribute in a multidimensional way, at the level of objectives and policies, to the PMDOT and to the SDG. The indicators outlined seek to be abstract, general, and replicable in the medium and long term. They consist of variables that are concrete and empirically measurable, and they record the recurrence of phenomena and their persistence overtime or their variations.\nAll these elements allow a selective mechanism of indicators to function, which operates through filters of relevance and consistency. Relevance refers to logical construction based on the content ofthe strategy; consistency, however, refers to the existence of sources of information orto the feasibility of constructing and applying instruments that allow it to be produced. In the first case, the indicators and their variables will function based on the administrative information from the management processes (information gathered through administrative data from local and national government bodies). In the second case, it is a matter of designing and applying instruments deliberately constructed to produce such information (quantitative and qualitative techniques). Appendix 2 presents the matrix of indicators for Resilient Quito, which is structured according to the five pillars of work and their respective goals and indicators. The identification of these indicators has taken into account the different planning and management instruments (such as the ICQ-MDQ quality of life index, PMDOT policies and objectives, the United Nations SDGs, and the NUA indicators and targets) that correspond to these goals. Each indicator is accompanied by its description and assessment.\n9. THE ROAD FROM HERE\nMOVING THE RESILIENCE AGENDA FORWARD\nResilient Quito is the result of the priceless contributions of many people with profound knowledge of the city. The intuition and inspiration generously provided by key actors during countless discussions, brainstorming sessions, structured workshops, and research fueled this work. This must continue.\nAfter its publication, an implementation plan will be constructed with the different municipal agencies of the city and partners working together to identify priority actions and design and develop programs and projects that create a time frame transcending election cycles, identify resources, and establish a road map in order to achieve effective results. Together with these stakeholders, we will forge the connections between Resilient Quito and the city, especially with and for the most vulnerable. In this sense, the Resilience Advisory Council and its members will act not only as partners in the implementation, but also in the follow-up process to Resilient Quito.\nAt the institutional level, the process carried out with the different municipal agencies clearly established the importance of multisector contributions and the need to generate internal synergies. For this reason, special emphasis will be placed on delving deeper into the model of collaborative work and inviting stakeholders from the private sector, the academic world, other municipalities,\nand NGOs to join in the effort. We start by recognizing that there is accumulated knowledge and experience as well as successful practices that can contribute to the city\u2019s development.\nAt the international level, through the 100RC initiative, we have found that there is a wide \u201clibrary\u201d of valuable experiences, and that the great potential of collaboration with cities has much to contribute in terms of acute shocks and common chronic stresses. 100RC and other networks can help us build an international agenda that guides and catalizes efforts through relevant experiences. At the same time, continued collaboration with the initiative\u2019s platform partners, which have contributed with work, initiatives and technical guidance, and with other new partners with different capacities and knowledge, will allow us to use all these resources strategically to implement the resilience agenda.\nFinally, the road to building resilience is a continuous process of constant learning in order to face multiple and ever-changing urban challenges. The city\u2019s capacity to survive and thrive requires a monitoring system to ensure periodic evaluations that show the advances in implementing the Resilience Strategy. This monitoring system will also make it possible to verify the impact ofthe different initiatives that contribute to building the city\u2019s resilience.","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["Mexico City

Summary\nThe City of Athens, a venerable yet intricate city of\nnear 700.000 residents, part of a 3.75 million people\nmetropolis, is for several years now facing a serious\nsocio-economic crisis. Through concerted efforts, the\ncity has managed to survive, to adapt and to transform\ninto a more creative and collaborative city. The struggle\nis by no means over. This last year, calling on the insights and expertise of hundreds of stakeholders, from opinion leaders and academics to women migrants and the\nhomeless, the city drafted its Resilience Strategy. This is\na set of practicable actions which first of all strengthen\nand scales up what has made our city stronger: formal\nand informal networks and alliances. Athens Resilience\nStrategy offers a set of new integrated ways to prepare\nand protect our most vulnerable from future shocks and\nstresses that the city will face.\nBoosting the city's resilience means creating new as well as revitalizing existing open and green public spaces. This is vital for our densely built and populated city, threatened by both intense heat (climate change) and earthquakes.\nThe city needs to become more forward thinking and\nproactive, turning its challenges into resources (vacant\nbuildings, newly arrived refugee and migrant populations, energy and waste). Around such resources it will build capacity and start to develop economies that, together with tourism and the creative sector, will generate\nthe city's future. Finally the city will strengthen its\ngovernment, through becoming more transparent and\naccountable, opening streams of communication, creating a digital agenda and innovation strategy.\nThis work does not stand alone; it is supported by several documents that have been instigated by or produced in alliance with the city's resilience journey. The first one came out of the 100RC Athens Network Exchange in September 2016 under the title \u201cGlobal Migration: Resilient Cities at the Forefront,\u201d and the second is a set of policy proposals \u201cAdvancing Equity for Athens' Resilience\u201d created for the city by Transatlantic Policy Lab program as a 100RC offering and funded by the Bertelsmann Foundation. Finally the Athens Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Action plan was\nproduced through a unique collaboration between C40\nand 100RC. These two documents together with the\nexisting Athens strategic and operational plans, frame this resilience strategy.\nThe resilience strategy is framed by four pillars, 65 actions and 53 supporting actions.\nOpen city: The City of Athens will achieve effective\nand efficient governance and manage to communicate\nand collaborate better with its residents by fostering\ndata driven policy making and accountability. The city\naims at becoming more transparent and accountable,\nstreamlining the city's processes and fostering\ncollaboration and engagement\nGreen city: We need nature in Athens. The city of\nthe future will meet our human need for proximity to\nnature and be able to withstand climate change and\nenvironmental challenges. The city aims at integrating\nnatural systems into the urban fabric, making our city\ncleaner, promoting sustainable mobility and co-creating\npublic spaces, fostering sustainable food systems and\nestablishing sustainable and equitable energy system.\nProactive city: Athens will streamline and up-scale\nits best \u2018survival' skills, and through planning and\ncommunication, it will create trustworthy and a safe\nenvironment for its people. The city wants to enhance\nplanning in the face of serious challenges, empower the\nmunicipal representatives as well as the voice of the local community and engage with the neighborhoods\nVibrant city: Athens will nurture and develop its assets in order to promote well-being, creativity, entrepreneurship and a new, inclusive, and exciting identity. The city aims at enhancing the city's identity and promoting new types of belonging as well as maximizing existing city assets and supporting employment.\nLetter from Mayor of Athens, Georgios Kaminis\nDear friends,\nI am proud to present to you the Athens' Resilience\nStrategy, a cohesive strategic plan for 2030, with a\nvision, measurable goals and prioritized actions, that\nprovides a new way of thinking on how to expand Athens' robustness, flexibility and inclusiveness.\nIn tandem with cities all over the world, following the\nguidelines and guidance set by the international urban\nnetwork 100 Resilient Cities, this resilience strategy\nwas designed in collaboration with a wide spectrum of\nAthenian stakeholders from academic institutions, the\npublic and private sectors as well as from civil society.\nIt provides a dynamic roadmap that, in dialogue with\nthe strategies and action plans currently in place for\nour city, includes and guides our efforts today, but also\narticulates our city's future challenges providing solutions for tomorrow's municipal leaders and residents. This plan acknowledges that we need everyone to be involved in\nthe design and implementation of long-term interventions that will build the resilience of this metropolitan capital.\nIt is the people of Athens that have been and will be the\nkey to the resilience of their city. Their agility and tenacity have been crucial every time that a disaster hits our city.\nIt is with the assistance of the Athenians that we managed to support the most vulnerable of our populations during the hard last seven years of economic recession and\nthe recent large refugee flows. As it is through broad\ncollaborations and synergies we formed with local and\ninternational networks, organizations and institutions that we were able to keep this city on its feet.\nBut we have to look to the future in order to be effective today. The Athens' Resilience Strategy is a forward thinking strategic intervention that aims at building an open, green, proactive and vibrant city by 2030.\nCreating a resilient Athens will be difficult and it will take time. But I believe we need to do it and we can do it, together, starting now.\nLetter from the President of 100 Resilient Cities, Michael Berkowitz\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want\nto congratulate Mayor Kaminis, the City of Athens, and\nChief Resilience Officer Eleni Myrivili on the release of\n\u201cAthens 2030,\u201d the city's Resilience Strategy, a major\nmilestone for the city and 100RC's partnership with it.\nSteeped in an ancient and storied past, Athens stands\nat the crossroads of the challenges and opportunities\nof the present. It has experienced several extreme\ntransformations throughout its history, from serving\nas the cradle of democracy and western civilization in\nantiquity, to fading into an Ottoman outpost of only 5000 people in the 19th century, to emerging as the dynamic and densely populated metropolis it is today. As Athens continues its recovery from the economic crisis and\nsubsequent austerity measures, and the sudden influx\nof migrants and refugees, it is poised to shape its future\nfrom the opportunities presented by its challenges. This\nStrategy provides the city a framework for actions that\nensure this is a future in which Athens not only survives\nbut thrives.\nWith \u201cAthens 2030,\u201d the city has set itself on a course\nto form meaningful urban resilience through plans\nthat account for the city's entire urban ecosystem. It\naddresses not only the city's shocks, such as earthquakes, and civil unrest, but its chronic stresses, such as heat waves, homelessness, poor air quality, long-term\nunemployment, and other continuous pressures that\nerode the urban fabric and exacerbate the major shocks\nwhen those do occur.\nThe city stands at the forefront of many challenges faced by the rest of Europe, and beyond. As it implements the Strategy and its integrated inter-systemic solutions, it can serve as a model to others. The Strategy's four pillars -Open city, Proactive city, Green city, Vibrant city - present a holistic framework with interventions that maximize the\ncity's assets and provide multiple benefits, like utilizing abandoned buildings to accommodate vulnerable populations, such as refugees and the homeless; or like creating green and cultural corridors to reclaim much needed green public space, reduce noise and unrest, mitigate the heat island effect, and foster further social cohesion by placing the citizen at the forefront. Many other such comprehensive projects abound.\nThrough the commitment and hard work of CRO Myrivili and her team, the Strategy provides an ambitious but practicable program and reflects the diversity of voices and communities engaged during its development. It also reflects the active role Athens has already played in our network, not least by hosting and leading a 100RC city exchange on migration late last year. The lessons and collaborations that formed during that exchange continue to lead to groundbreaking work and policy.\nThis Strategy reflects months of effort and tireless leadership, but in many ways the hard work is just beginning as the city sets forth on implementation. We are excited to see Athens continue to form a bridge between its rich past and the most important issues of the present and future as it does so. We are eager to continue the next stage of our partnership and collaborate in the implementation of this groundbreaking Strategy that will help ensure a resilient future for Athens and propel the resilience effort worldwide.\nLetter from CRO, Eleni Myrivili\nThe Athens' Resilience Strategy marks an important\nmoment in the history of the city. It is the first strategy\nthat equips our city with new ways of thinking of and\ndealing with the chronic stresses and the acute shocks\nthat we are likely to experience. The problems that cities face in the 21st century can no longer be dealt with the old solutions and tools. Urban Resilience is about facing and learning to adapt to hard challenges in ways that look towards the future. It's about being able to shift\nour point of view, redefine our goals and develop skills\nthat make us stronger. Resilience is all about dynamic\ntransformation. Athens has survived and is still adapting to a lot of adversity. We still need however to find ways to do it better. To see our challenges as opportunities that\ncan make us thrive in the near future. This is why this is a strategy with its eyes on 2030.\nThis Resilience Strategy has been created through\ncollaborations and many hours of listening to a broad\nrange of individuals and organizations. For Athens,\nresilience has been achieved and will always be about\nbuilding connections between people and breaking down silos between administrative departments, different levels of governance, the public and private sectors, civil society and academic institutions. These connections can stimulate not only thought but also action. It is with the help, knowledge, insight and the dedicated time of many Athenians, that we managed to co-design specific goals and clear, actionable steps that facilitate effective implementation. We would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank all of you for your generosity of thought and all of your input.\nBut designing, building and acting have feeble results\nif there is no clear vision. This Strategy has gathered\ndiverse images of the city's future and articulates a\nconcise vision. We see a city that in 2030 is open, green, proactive and vibrant. This can be reached though eco-\nsocial policies that elevate the role of local government\nand give it its rightful place as a major player in economic development and employment services, social welfare and environmental adaptation and resilience, and clean-tech and technological innovation.\nThe strategy alone will not achieve this vision. Publishing and disseminating it, continuing to shape it with the people of the municipality and our communities, and getting individuals and organizations actively involved, is what will keep it alive and relevant.\nAn Open Invitation\nThis invitation goes out to everyone committed to helping to protect and improve the lives of all Athenians. Help us strengthen the city as it prepares for the future.\nIndividuals, community groups, institutions and private\nbusinesses, let us know new ways of thinking or doing\nthings for the city; tell us about projects that can\ntransform it; work with us to implement resilience actions that inspire you.\nResilience is about being prepared for and open to,\nchange and transformation. This is not a fixed strategy:\nour world is changing too fast. What our strategy\nprovides is a framework that demonstrates while\nembedding the logic of resilience in policy-making. We're all in this together.\nWhy a Resilience Strategy?\nLike many cities around the world, Athens is adjusting\nto the challenges of the 21st century. Hyper-connected\neconomies are radically changing patterns in world\nmarkets and employment; the effects of climate\nchange are increasingly apparent; social, ethnic and\nhealth inequalities are deepening; resources are\nbecoming scarcer while consumption is growing; and\nauthoritarianism and\/or ethno-national movements are\non the rise. Urban communities and economies will have to develop tools and skills that will help them survive, adapt and thrive in the face of multiple and unpredictable disruptions.\nAthens has experienced significant shocks during the\nrecent past, that exposed the weaknesses of the city\nand the long-term stresses underlying them. The socio-\neconomic crisis laid bare the failings and limitations within the city. It also revealed the city's essential strengths, hidden resources and talents. The question is - how can Athens reflect, learn and proactively put in place resourceful, robust and inclusive systems that not only deal with current difficulties and shortcomings but also transform the city and make it strong and successful for a future that will bring new challenges?\nThe declining incomes, growing personal debt, and high\nreal estate taxes, coupled with austerity measures that\ndrove cuts in social services, hit our most vulnerable\npopulations the hardest. Unprecedented levels of\nunemployment, poverty and homelessness grew in our\ncity, exposing our lack of preparation, together with the\npressing need to have systems in place able to provide for the basic needs of the most exposed. The City of Athens rose to the challenge: through partnerships with NGOs and the private sector we built and are still building a\nrobust system for critical relief and social services as well as a rationalized system of data collection and logistics. Moving forward, such partnerships, no less than such data collection and development systems, should be scaled-up and replicated horizontally in city government, leading to an open and vibrant city where data based decision making, transparency and accountability.\nClimate change is increasing the risk of extreme events,\nundermining many assumptions we have been using to\nplan and develop our city. There is insufficient climate\nprotection of existing buildings, while, in the vast\nmajority, public works and new building construction\ndisregard local climate conditions. In addition, the lack\nof updated legislation on energy and environmental\nprotection for buildings and other urban infrastructure,\nhave contributed to an increase in the urban heat island\neffect, the social and economic decline and desolation of the city center, the socio-economic squeeze of the lower income brackets, as well as pushing 23% of our residents into energy poverty. The Athens Climate Change\nAdaptation and Mitigation Action Plans, an outcome of\nour collaboration with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, are a fundamental part of this Resilience Strategy. They outline concrete steps for improving the urban\nquality of life in the face of increasing temperatures,\nflash floods and bad air quality. Climate change resilience should pervade all city's decisions and policies; it should become embedded in the administrations economic logic and reflexes.\nOther examples of challenges for Athens are:\n\u2022 Sharp decline in the population\n\u2022 Large influx of refugees\n\u2022 Increasingly aging infrastructure\n\u2022 Threat of earthquakes, violence, and civil unrest\n\u2022 Fragmented government structure and overlapping jurisdictions.\nThe Resilience Strategy paves the way for a city\nthat is proactive, setting forth concrete actions that\naddress issues of maintenance, safety, efficiency and\naccountability, crisis preparedness and management.\nThe large flows of refugees through our city, in numbers that exceeded the total number of our residents during 2015 and 2016, intensified the pressures on our social\nservices and critical relief activities. This influx increased the pressure on our waste management system, the demand for social housing, and highlighted the lack of existing integration programs. Nevertheless, the refugees present an opportunity vital for the city.\nThe austerity driven budget cuts to local governments\nand thus public works, revealed our aging infrastructure and the need to put into place robust maintenance programs and long term integrated planning.\nThe Athens earthquake of 1999 revealed the city's lack\nof preparedness. This is a significant challenge as Greece is considered a country that has the 6th highest seismic activity level in the world. A set of resilience building\nactions address our built environment in an integrated\nand proactive way, linking this weakness to dynamic\ndevelopment and urban transformation projects.\nViolence and civil unrest have also been changing the\nurban landscape during the socio-economic crisis, and\nthere is long standing need for new perspectives that can keep the city safe.\nLast but not least, long standing problems of Athens\ndirectly related to urban planning, public transportation and urban mobility, air quality and the city's green and blue infrastructures, are significant to planning and\nimplementing resilience on a metropolitan scale.\nThe Athens Resilience Strategy, developed with the\nsupport of 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation -, presents a series of distinct yet connected actions with a clear vision of how the city can best cope with the increasing interdependency of shocks and stresses. It links new resilience-building actions\nwith existing efforts, and relies heavily on our urban communities, who proved effective and resilient during times of crisis.\nUrban resilience and 100 Resilient Cities\nThe Rockefeller Foundation pioneered the 100RC initiative in response to the trends of urbanization, globalization and climate change.\nDefinition of resilience\n100RC defines urban resilience as the capacity of individuals, institutions,\nbusinesses and systems within a city to adapt, survive and thrive no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nAs cities grow larger, the likely\nconsequences of unexpected events\nare ever greater for individual cities.\nCities are also more numerous and\nincreasingly interdependent, meaning\nthe effects of events in one place can\nbe felt around the world. Meanwhile,\nclimate change increased the likelihood of great numbers of catastrophic events happening.\nChronic Stresses\nChallenges that weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis. Examples include sea level rise, increasing pressures on healthcare services,\nunemployment, and deeper social inequality.\nAcute Shocks\nSudden events that threaten a city. Examples include\nearthquakes, heat-waves, flash-floods, and cyber attacks.\nAthens' resilience challenges\nEach city's resilience journey begins with a diagnostic\nassessment that delineates its own significant challenges. Through several months of interviewing and engaging people from different Athenian communities, including that of the academic and administrative experts on\nnatural and man-made disasters, Resilient Athens\nprioritized the following shocks and stresses as the most important for our city.\nAcute Shocks\nFor every 1\u00b0C temperature increase in Athens\n\u2022 5.2% increase in mortality rates for the period 2000-2012 (for Tdaily,MAX>31.5\u00b0C)\n\u2022 6% increase in smog for Tdaily,MAX>22\u00b0C (correlated to asthma and respiratory illnesses)\n\u2022 10% drop in sales at cities (for Athens at Tdaily,MAX>36\u00b0C)\n\u2022 4.1% increase in the use of electricity in the city\nShock #1: Earthquakes\nOver 30% of buildings in the City of Athens were\nconstructed before the first building code for earthquake protection, a serious vulnerability in a country with the 6th highest seismic activity level in the world. The city's urban environment is densely populated, streets are\nnarrow, public open spaces are few, and the building\nstock is aging (only a small part of its has been evaluated and fortified against earthquakes). The city is unprepared to confront another serious seismic event.\nThe Athens July 21st, 1987, and a lethal heatwave\n\u2022 Lasting almost 10 days,\n\u2022 2,000 heat related deaths.\n\u2022 Tdaily,max= 41-44\u00b0C, Tnight,min>28\u00b0C (for 10 days long)\n\u2022 2960 heat-related admissions recorded in hospitals\n\u2022 31% fatalities among admitted cases\nThe Athens September 7th, 1999 earthquake\n\u2022 5.9 on the Richter scale \u2022 138 people died,\n\u2022 74,053 houses were completely or partially destroyed (homes for 209,842 people)\n\u2022 8,388 enterprises were completely or partially\ndestroyed (850 closed permanently)\n\u2022 The total number of people affected was estimated\nat 100,000\nShock #3: Civil Unrest\nDemonstrations take place in Athens almost on a daily\nbasis, and are organized by labor unions, political parties, anti-authoritarian groups, student groups, and other collectivities. These demonstrations vary in size and intensity but they always take place in the city center. In some cases they become violent riots that can last for several days. They exert extraordinary pressures on the city's daily functions, logistics and infrastructures. Under the ongoing conditions of socio-economic crisis, the city often feels like a pressure cooker.\nShock #2: Climate Change related Shocks\n(Heat waves, flash floods, poor air quality)\nClimate change scenarios indicate that extreme heat\nevents are expected to typify the city's future. Between 2021 and 2050, average summer temperatures in Athens are projected to increase by 2\u00b0C; between 2071 and 2100 the projected increase goes up to 4\u00b0C. We are already\nobserving a gradual increase in the length and level of\nhigh temperatures as well as the frequency and intensity of heat waves and other related phenomena such as flash floods and bad air quality. The Athenian Urban Heat Island, intensified by the rising heat, exhibits severe temperature differences reaching 6\u00b0C, 7\u00b0C even 10\u00b0C between the city center and its suburbs. The density, anarchy and bad quality of our built urban fabric, as well as the lack of green open spaces are the main culprits.\nDuring the period 2011-2015, throughout Greece 27,103 demonstrations were organized, averaging 15 per day.\n28-29 June 2011, 35 damaged businesses, cost\n500.000\u20ac\n19-20 October 2011, 62 damaged businesses, cost\n400.000\u20ac\n12 February 2012, 200 damaged businesses, cost\n70.000.000\u20ac\nMunicipal Cleaning service of Athens collected:\n12 February 2012: 40 tonnes pieces of marble and rocks\n6 December 2014: 50 tonnes of rocks\nShock #4: Cybercrime\nCybercrime in Greece is a rising challenge. The City of\nAthens is at the center of many operational decision\nmaking procedures while also hosting several critical\ninfrastructures and public utility networks. It is therefore a high-risk target for cyber attacks. According to the National Intelligence Service and specifically the National Authority Against Electronic Attacks (NAAEA), 2016 was one of the worst years for cyber-attacks in Greece and worldwide. These attacks are advanced and sophisticated, mostly targeting governmental databases and websites. The City of Athens is in close collaboration with these agencies to prepare a robust prevention plan against such attacks. The Greek Cybercrime Center (GCC) is part of an emerging coordinated European effort, which has the capacity to significantly improve education and research in the newly growing area of cybercrime.\nOnline behavioral patterns\nAccording to Eurostat, in 2014, 49% of the Greek population used the Internet every day, while in 2005, the daily usage of the Internet was only up to 11% . Greek internet users have the lowest\nlevel (37%) of confidence (Eurobarometer 390 \/\nWave EB77.2 - TNS Opinion & Social) in using the internet for things like online banking or buying things online and a very high percentage (81%) of believing that their online personal information is not kept secure by public authorities.\nChronic Stresses\nStress #2: Aging Infrastructure\nMany buildings in Athens are of very poor quality, have unsafe structural elements, and are not energy efficient. They do not comply with the regulatory guidelines for the Greek Building Code and their increasing energy demands add to the city's greenhouse gas emissions and energy poverty rates. Beyond our building stock, all infrastructures in Athens are suffering from lack of proper maintenance, lack of proactive long term planning, lack of data and data driven policies. The economic recession (including a 60% municipal budget cut since 2011), has exacerbated the problem: our roads, pavements, parks, playgrounds, facades, garbage bins, etc., are openly showing their deterioration, their age and scars.\nStress #3: Migration\nBy the end of 2016 about 60.000 newcomers - refugees and immigrants - were recorded as living in Greece. Around 20.000 of them are currently living in Athens: half of them are Syrians while others come from Afghanistan, Palestine, Iran and Kurdistan. All of them (nearly 97%) arrived through Turkey and only 8% of them are willing to stay in Greece. Since 2015 over a million people crossed through Greek territories on their way to a better and safer life in the European Union. The initial shock has become a stress for the city neighborhood and systems that are struggling with unemployment, poverty, budget cuts and aging infrastructures.\nStress #1: Depressed Macroeconomic Conditions\nSince 2009, Greece has been in recession, with depressed macroeconomic conditions and severe cuts in social and public services. High unemployment has been the worst of its consequences. According to the Hellenic Statistical Authority, in January 2017 the Attica region unemployment rate was 22.7%.\nIn an economy that has shrunk by 25% since the beginning of the crisis, poverty and homelessness are rising, and so are taxes and private debt - at 222 billion euros in 2016. Many Athenians are struggling with delinquent loans (31.75 of all housing loans) and the threat of home repossessions.\nStress #4: Mistrust\nDuring 2016, the Greek Ombudsman issued a report analyzing the widely spread feeling of mistrust between citizens and public services. This is only a small aspect of the large phenomenon of mistrust that Athenians have towards all levels of government, administrative or elected. This is the outcome of centuries of political partisanship and mismanagement of resources, corruption and clientelism, lack of transparency and accountability. Unfortunately mistrust, pervasive and insidious, keeps undermining a lot of worthy effort.\nIntroduction\nAbout 100RC\n100 Resilient Cities (100RC), pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis. By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.\nCities in the 100RC network are provided with the\nresources necessary to develop a roadmap to resilience\nalong four main pathways:\n1.\tFinancial and logistical guidance for establishing an innovative new position in city government, a Chief Resilience Officer, who will lead the city's resilience efforts,\n2.\tExpert support for development of a robust resilience strategy,\n3.\tAccess to solutions, service providers, and partners from the private, public and NGO sectors who can help them develop and implement their resilience strategies, and\n4.\tMembership of a global network of member cities who can learn from and help each other.\nThrough these actions, 100RC aims not only to help\nindividual cities become more resilient, but will facilitate\nthe building of a global practice of resilience among\ngovernments, NGOs, the private sector, and individual\ncitizens.\nCity Resilience Framework\nThe 100RC program uses a framework - developed by Arup and the Rockefeller Foundation - called the City Resilience Framework (CRF). The CRF acts as a lens that brakes down the complexity of city systems and analyses\ntheir specific function in the drivers that contribute to city resilience. The framework is made up of four main dimensions and 12 drivers that together illustrate what makes a resilient city.\nCity Resilience Index (Arup and Rockefeller Foundation, 2014)\nQualities\nA resilient city also exhibits seven qualities, which should be evident in the way the city - or any system, function or\nasset within the city - operates\t\tThese are:\t\nReflective\tResourceful\tInclusive\tIntegrated\nUsing past experience to inform future decisions\tRecognizing alternative ways to use resources\tPrioritize broad consultation to create sense of shared ownership in decision making\tBring together a range of distinct systems and institutions\nRobust\tRedundant\tFlexible\nWell-conceived, constructed, and managed systems\tSpare capacity purposively created to accommodate disruption\tWillingness, ability to adopt alternatives strategies in response to changing circumstances\nAthens SWOT analysis\nStrengths\n\u2022 High levels of education \u2022 High quality of life standards\n\u2022 Innovative creative industry \u2022 Strong touristic assets\n\u2022 A variety of solidarity organizations ity of Athens social services with expertise & experience ites S>f natural beauty associated with historical landmarks\n\u2022 Diversity of land use \u2022 Diverse population mix (non-gentrification)\n\u2022 Bottom-up initiatives with a focus on local issues\nOpportunities\n\u2022 Development of local SMEs value-chains\/clusters, use of new technologies and innovation, emergence of new sectors\nCoordination maximization among stakeholders and the\nmunicipality [for both social cohesion and better policy\nmaking plans and results]\n\u2022 Development of urban \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d projects\nCCooolilninggCCeenntetersrsininAAththeennss--H\n\u2022 Upgrade public space\neveiopment of the multi-functional and multi-cultural city's\nassets (e.g. creative industries)\npen\u00abcOta and new technologies development facilitating\nboth working through and preventing crisis\nWeaknesses\n\u2022o pPulation decrease \/ Brain drain\n\u2022gh aging index\n\u2022e gNative income rate\n\u2022e dRuced business turnover\n\u2022e dRuce of commercial and processing activities\n\u2022gh unemployment rate, increased poverty and extreme poverty index\n\u2022n cIrease of homeless people\n\u2022a cLk of proper monitoring of policy impacts\n\u2022mImigrants \/ Refugees flows (instability of population)\n\u2022o wL quality, quantity and dispersal of green areas\n\u2022giAng infrastructure, abandoned building stock\n\u2022gh population density\nThreats\n\u2022owL productivity because of aging population\n\u2022n cIreased rates of population decrease, continual brain drain\n\u2022e pDressed macroeconomic conditions, decrease of economic activity\n\u2022gh prediction of unemployment rates\n\u2022e tDerioration of social fabric, phenomena of social exclusion, lack of social cohesion\n\u2022n cIrease of riots, civil unrest and violence\n\u2022grbnts and refugee flows trapped in the city\n\u2022n sIufficient maintenance of natural resources\n\u2022u rFther downgrading of building stock and public spaces\n\u2022n cIrease of air and smog pollution\n\u2022\tHeat waves\n\u2022\tEarthquakes\nCity milestones\n1.\tA rapidly expanding City\nThe metropolitan area of Athens covers today an\nexpansion of 2.929 Km2 with a population of 3.75 million people. While already a capital, the city underwent a period of rapid development and modernization after the Second World War with growth rates of up to 8 percent per year.. Between 1951 and 1981, the population of the urban area more than doubled, from 1,379,000 to 3,027,090 inhabitants.\nEconomic growth and entry into the EU in 1981 brought\nnew investment and credit which raised the standard of\nliving. Massive housing construction quickly changed\nthe character of Athens, imposing a modern but at times haphazard character. New infrastructure developed, such as public transportation, but growth was chaotic with a\nproliferation of \u201cpolykatoikia,\u201d the multi-story residential building. Home ownership became one of the most important tenets of identity of the new urban middle class.\nThe new urban lifestyle emphasized modernity, hygiene and amenities such as central heating, and social integration. The typology of the \u201cpolykatoikia\u201d has permitted mixed uses (residential and commercial) as well as vertical stratification among social classes and ethnic identities. Athens thus avoided the creation of urban \u201cghettos.\u201d At the same time, the \u201cpolykatoikias\u201d present extraordinary fragmentation. It is not unusual for a block in the city center to have over 500 different owners. In the early 1980s, the stress of urban congestion, traffic, noise, Urban Heat Island (UHI) and air pollution resulted in urban flight and a move to the suburbs. But Athens remained among the most dense municipalities in the developed world.\nIn the absence of integrated planning the pressure on the natural environment grew exponentially. Massive construction and a rapidly growing road system signified a depletion of peri-urban green and the covering of the majority of the natural water network of the Attica plain including its two rivers. This has directly contributed to increased temperatures and recurring flush-floods today as well as increasing the risk of earthquake damages.\nLand use and Impervious surface coverage in Attica region\nThe age of the city's buildings\nNumber of Buildings\n\u25a0>\nThe first spatial plan with a metropolitan vision was adopted in 1985, and the Organization for the Planning and Environmental Protection of Athens (ORSA), was created to monitor its implementation. The plan marked an ambitious effort to curb sprawl, reduce social disparities and enhance the environmental protection, all from an institutional and regulatory perspective. However, the selection of Athens as host city of the 2004 Olympic Games meant that metropolitan spatial planning was bypassed in favor of urgent, large infrastructure needs. A wave of developments transformed the metropolitan area enabling urban sprawl and increasing car dependency. The Olympic Games ended up being a lost opportunity for a long-term metropolitan strategic plan. Ten years on, the debate on the metropolitan governance of Athens has not led anywhere.\nCity milestones\n2.\tThe years of socio-economic crisis\nThe global financial crisis of 2007-2008 exposed the fragility of the Greek economy and its facade of prosperity based on debt. The deficits caused the country to borrow and international lending institution (the European Union, The European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund), start dictating the Greek government's fiscal decisions. Austerity imposed in 2010 led to a harsh recession and high unemployment. By 2015, Greeks had lost 33% of purchasing power and 25% of income.\nMeanwhile, the population decreased. Construction, in decline after the Olympics, collapsed. Thousands of new apartments stood empty; renovations stalled. Mortgage debt and new property taxes hit property ownership.\nThe number of homeless increased and food and energy poverty grew. Immigrants without job prospects became more marginalized and desperate, while the Fascist party \u201cGolden Dawn\u201d grew as did incidents of hate crimes. The sudden collapse of the central state social welfare system and the shock of the crisis created however a new wave of citizen mobilization and solidarity networks and led the Municipality adopting a more expansive role in the sphere of social policy.\nCity of Athens social policy\n\u2022o vCering Daily Meals for 1400 people\n\u2022t Cen's Solidarity Hub: social grocery, social pharmacy, social laundry, psychological and legal support, food and clothing \u201cstore\u201d for 26.000 beneficiaries\n\u2022\t46.468 Food Vouchers from EAA grants: 9.000 beneficiaries\n\u2022\t10.000 families receive monthly food baskets (FEAD: 2016-2017)\n\u2022\t35.000 residents on Guaranteed Minimum Income 2017\n\u2022\t5000 senior citizens are members of the Athens Senior Clubs\n\u2022\t15.000 Residents are receiving social benefits\n\u2022\t50 families hosted in social apartments\n\u2022\t20 women hosted in the city Shelter for battered women\n\u2022\t58.000 health related visits per year to our 6 Municipal Health Clinics\nOpportunities in times of crisis\nThe severe socio-economic crisis, however, also revealed the powers of solidarity and creativity in Greek society. The crisis led to the growth of civil society. The nonprofit sector, grassroots organizations and informal groups are providing services that improve the city's quality of life.\nMunicipal initiatives and institutional changes based on civic engagement\n\u2022h eT synAthina City of Athens CSO network \u2022c hSools Open to Society and the Neighborhood \u2022o mCmercial Triangle Pocket Innovation and Revitalization Project\n\u2022e sRilience building Strategy for Athens - 100RC \u2022stEablishment of the Office of Resilience & Sustainability as part of the Municipal Organizational Structure\n\u2022stEablishment of the Office of Innovation as part of the Municipal Organizational Structure\n\u2022n uAanl Conference for Public Consultation (\u201cDiaskepsis for Athens\u201d)\n\u2022a rPticipatory budgeting (in progress)\n\u2022a rPticipatory aspects of our waste management Plan (in progress)\nThe parts of the economy that kept growing during the crisis were the tourism and cultural sectors. The city started re-branding itself as the visitors also began to look beyond its classical monuments and landmarks. New ones, like the new National Museum of Contemporary Art (EMST) and the Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, among others are taking their rightful turn.\nEqually significant is the recent rise of creative industries. Albeit the brain drain a significant number of highly educated and talented young Athenians are creating new types of growth areas in the city's economy. Despite the crisis, the cultural and creative sectors seem to be recovering contributing about 5% to the regional GDP.\n3.\tChanging demographics: Two waves of migrant and refugee flows\nAfter the 1989 collapse of the eastern bloc, Athens experienced a massive influx of economic migrants from the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Asian and African countries recording a 463.91% increase between 1991 and 2011 In line with the urban sprawl of Greek populations towards the suburbs, with rates reaching over 20 percent which had left a high number of vacancies at the dense city center they took cheap apartments, ground floors or basements of old \u201cpolykatoikias\u201d changing for the first time the until then homogeneous demographic.\nStarting in 2014 but peaking in the summer of 2015, during the sixth consecutive year into an economic crisis, close to a million refugees arrived in Athens on their long journey to other European countries. Within the course of a few weeks, city squares and parks quickly became the unofficial meeting point and temporary home for thousands of refugees. Creating a major shock for the city Athens, with very little infrastructure in place or experience in refugee reception, suddenly found itself in the forefront of the biggest refugee movement since World War II in Europe. Currently there are around 20.000 migrants and refugees living within the municipality of Athens constituting thus about a 5% increase in the population.\nThe central government excessively controls key authorities and jurisdictions, hampering local governance. Regions and municipalities rely on government transfers and EU funding. While some weak mechanisms for metropolitanwide co-ordination and planning do exist, they face significant institutional and operational limits.\nThe metropolitan question in a centralized country\nThe last effort to streamline and decentralize the complex system of sub-national authorities was the 2011 Kallikratis reform that reduced the municipalities from 1034 to 325. Still, it failed to truly reform fiscal resource allocation across and within levels of government.\nFor example, public transportation improvements are a pressing challenge. In 2011, the Greek government merged several operating companies streamlining transportation governance in the Athens metropolitan area under OASA. OASA operates under the Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport and Networks; there is no co-ordination with the local or regional authorities on transport planning.\nIn Attica as in the rest of Greece, informally developed areas are usually incorporated ex post facto within official town boundaries: an additive logic. Uncontrolled growth causes car-dependency, congestion, air pollution and the degradation of the environment. According to a 2015 OECD report, despite efforts to guide urban growth, a series of structural challenges have remained:\n\u2022\ta gap between planning and implementation;\n\u2022\ta gap between spatial planning and socio-economic planning;\n\u2022\tthe incomplete development of basic land management tools;\n\u2022\tand the lack of participatory planning.\nIn order to further Resilience in Athens, metropolitan governance reforms and a carefully designed financial scheme, must be implemented. Stakeholder mobilization has to focus on a shared set of policy priorities for a more Open, Green, Proactive and Vibrant City of Athens.\nBuilding a resilience strategy\nThrough a competitive process the City of Athens was\nselected in 2014 to join the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC)\nnetwork. The city engaged in an intense and participatory process in order to draft and implement a holistic, robust and realistic strategy that supports and enhances the\nresilience of the city for the upcoming decades.\nIn the spring of 2015, Athens introduced the concepts and methods of the 100 Resilient Cities program by convening an Agenda Setting Workshop (with 130 Athenians).\nFebruary 2016, the city started its resilience-building\njourney by establishing the Office of Resilience and\nSustainability (ORS) and drafting a robust Stakeholder\nEngagement Plan. The ORS became a part of the new\norganizational structure of the municipality gaining\nofficial status (Government Gazette No 3812\/B'\/28-11-\n2016) as part of the Mayor's Office in December 2016.\nFor several months, in the beginning of the program\nwe interviewed Athenians, from experts, artists and\ncommunity leaders to industrialists, homeless and women migrants, asking them what they thought made our city resilient and how they envisioned a resilient Athens in\n2030. We also started by creating a registry of all the\nprojects and programs planned for or implemented in\nAthens. Along with all the other cities we also identified\nour city's critical assets, shocks and stresses.\nBased on these diagnostic activities, in July 2016, we\nreleased Athens's Preliminary Resilience Assessment\n(PRA). The PRA set the resilience baseline for Athens,\nintroducing 5 discovery areas that the city had to explore more in order to discover opportunities that would help it built its resilience. The discovery areas are:\n\u2022 Maximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022 Data driven and inclusive city\n\u2022 Nature in the city: Best possible use of urban resources \u2022 Crisis within crisis\n\u2022 Enhance social cohesion (cross-cutting)\nNumerous people including experts, representatives\nfrom the local, regional and central government, city-\ndistrict leaders and other civil society and community\nambassadors, platform partners and the strategy partner actively participated in the process. Through desktop research, interviews, working group meetings, workshops and conferences, we examined the specific opportunities and challenges that started emerging. This process\nhelped us shape our vision for a resilient Athens -- a city\nthat is open, green, proactive and vibrant.\nA year and a half after the beginning of the Resilient\nAthens program, the city is bestowed with this strategic\ndocument created in collaboration with 140 organizations and 900 citizens which participated in 40 workshops, conferences or public events. During this year Resilient Athens also initiated and co-hosted international meetings with fellow cities; international and local experts worked together trying to get a better grasp of the challenges the city is facing as they searched for resilient solutions.\nBeyond the main three international collaborations\naround the themes of Migration (100RC), Climate\nChange (C40 Cites) and Social Equity (Bertelsmann\nFoundation), our office also co-organized together with\nother municipalities, central government representatives, NGOs and the Heinrich Bell Foundation two multiple day conferences on Municipal Energy Savings and\nEnergy Poverty with about 200 participants. We also coorganized with Symbiosis - Center for Political Studies of the Council of Europe, a two-day workshop on Open Data and local government with 100 participants including\nadministrators from four other municipalities, relevant\nministries and public utility companies.\nFour big cross-sectoral and cross-jurisdictional working\ngroups of more than 100 people were also part of this\nvery busy and inspiring year, along with several smaller\nworkshops. They all aimed at breaking municipal and\ncross level administrative silos while focusing on the\nfollowing themes: heat waves and the urban heat island\neffects, greening the city, Athens assets and risks,\nwomen entrepreneurs, migration and integration, best\npractices for social cohesion and coexistence, city\nbranding and public-private sector collaborations, urban planning and sustainable mobility. In February 2017, 30 city officers and 30 citizens participated in a ProblemFraming Workshop, organized by a 100RC platform\npartner citymart. The workshop tried to identify major\nchallenges and realistic solutions to waste management\nand city cleaning. A lot of our municipal departments and agencies were active participants in the whole process providing key input regarding the everyday management of the city and the current legislative and regulatory\nframework of Greek local authorities.\nFinally, the Resilience Steering Committee (RSC) played a crucial role as our overseeing body of experts. The RSC is an interdisciplinary cohort of high-level stakeholders from different governmental, academic and nonprofit institutions covering a brad range of expertise. The committee comprises of 18 members and is led by the Mayor of Athens. Their key objective is to provide\ninterdisciplinary input and guidance on the content of the Athens resilience strategy as it develops, on its integration into the city's operations, implementation and funding. The RSC has met four times providing valuable input and inspiration in the formation of the Athens Resilient Strategy.\nAthens' Resilience Strategy also draws upon other local, regional, national and international strategic documents, including the city's Plan of Integrated Urban Intervention (SOAP), the city's Sustainable Urban Development Plan (SVAA), Integrated Territorial Investments Actions (OXE), the New Regulatory Plan of Athens-Attica 2021 (RSA), as well as the Urban Agenda for the EU, the New Urban Agenda - Habitat III and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. From early on, our office collaborated closely with the C40 Advisor for Athens, leading to the first Athens Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Plan (April 2017). This collaboration in Athens anticipated and underscored\nthe official partnership developed between the 100RC Network and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (December 2016). The connections with other strategic documents elevates the Athens Resilient Strategy's integration and robustness, bridging the gaps between different institutions as well as gaps that exist between the city's everyday management and its long-term policy commitments and goals. The Mayor of Athens has also signed the 10% resilience pledge and committed to an integrated building of resilience in the city, Currently, according to Arup's brief, the city has achieve a 17% coverage of the pledge.\nLinking the resilience strategy with other plans in Athens\nWe mapped our pillars, goals and actions to the Sustainable Urban ievelopment Plan, NSRF funding Axis and Integrated Urban ievelopment Plan (SOAP) to understand the interdependencies between the resilience strategy and the other plans in the city. Refer to the appendix for details.\nInternational meetings\nThe 100RC network connects Athens with other cities and organizations across the world. During its first year of operation, the Resilient Athens team initiated and hosted two international meetings with fellow 100RC cities, partners and experts. In July 2016, Athens hosted the European leg of the first Trans-Atlantic Policy Lab aiming to identify and propose policies that mitigate social inequity in the United States and\nEurope. In September 2016, Athens, in partnership with the 100 Resilient Cities and Chief Resilience Officers (CRO) from eight of its member cities launched the Athens Network Exchange: Cities and the Global Migration Crisis.\nField of Opportunities\nDrawing on local proposals and best practices from Athens and cities around the world, especially from our 100RC network partners, we have identified more than 138 relevant opportunities to tackle resilience challenges. We tested and refined each opportunity using the principles of the 100RC City Resilience Framework and the Resilience and the Reality Lenses - tools developed by 100RC and our strategy partner ARUP. This ensured that resilience was embedded in the actions bringing the broadest possible benefits to the city. We then further evaluated our 138\nopportunities during Athens Field of Opportunities (FoO). The FoO ensured the Athens Resilient Strategy is fact-based and data-driven but also, thought its making, a result of transparent and extensive dialogue and consultation with many relevant stakeholders. After the FoO, we had finalized the set of 65 resilient actions, which we reshaped and organized under 4 pillars and 13 Resilience goals.\nAthens Migration Network Exchange\nFollowing the Network Exchange, participants released \u201cGlobal Migration: Resilient Cities at the Forefront\u201d. Featuring 24 city best practices and 18 practitioner tools, this report points to programs being implemented in cities across the globe that demonstrate how to best integrate migrants into their new homes, while also creating benefits for all residents.\nLearn more at: https:\/\/medium.com\/resilient-cities-at-the-forefront\nPhase I: Kick-starting Resilient Athens Office, Team and Investigations\n2014\n2014\nSelection\n2015\nMay 2015\t\u2022\nAgenda Setting Workshop\nrrsesfriloiemn tt hdeiamlougnuieciipnaAlittyh,etnhse,\tDiagnostic activities in Phase I:\nsaenc1t0or0apsawrtenlel trhs efoaccuasdeedmoina\tWhat makes Athens Resilient?\n2016\nFebruary 2016 Office for Resilience and Sustainability\nFebruary - June 2016\nFocus Groups with municipal and local stakeholders:\n\u2022 May 2016\nMoU with National Observatory of Athens\nMay 2016\nAssets and Risks Workshop\nJune 2016\nConference on heat waves and measures for #CoolAthens\nJune 2016\nTrans-Atlantic Policy Lab (TAPL)\nJuly 2016\nPreliminary Resilient Assessment (PRA):\nDiagnostic Activities in Phase II: How will we make Athens resilient?\n2016\nMarch 2016 - January 2017\nCross-departmental and cross-sectoral working groups\nPhase II: Co-creating and launching Athens Resilience Strategy\nSeptember 2016-February 2017\nIdentification of resilient opportunities\nSeptember 2016\nAthens Migration Exchange Network\nQ Start partnership with Findyr\nStart partnership with citymart\nNovember 2016 - February 2017\nStudy for Creative Economy and Resilience\nDecember 2016 Urban Policy Lab\nDecember 2016:\nInnovative practices of coexistence in an Athenian neighborhood\n2017\n0 January 2017\nWorkshop: Communications in case of emergency\nFebruary 2017 Field Of Opportunities Workshop (FoO)\nJanuary 2017\nA resilient dinner with Athenian women\nMarch -June 2017\nDrafting and presenting the Athens Resilience Strategy\nMarch 2017\nProblem Framing Workshop\n39\nHow to read this chapter\nACTIONS\nA.1\nResilience Goals:\nThe graphic adjacent to each Action represents the interrelations that the action has with goals from other pillars in the strategy.\nSupporting\nActions\nCall out boxes:\nThe call out boxes highlight best practice from Athens and other cities in the 100RC network.\nMega Resilience Projects (MRPs):\nThese are city wide overarching and strategic projects that have multiple benefits for the city.\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG's)\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit on 25 September 2015 includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals with 169 associated targets that demonstrate the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda. This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom and eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions by taking transformative steps that are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. The Goals and targets are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental. They will stimulate action over the next fifteen years in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet.\nLegislative authority:\nThese icons represent exisiting (or not) legislative authority for every action.

The city of the future will meet our human need for proximity to nature and be able to withstand climate change and environmental challenges.\nA Proactive city\nAthens will streamline and\nup-scale its best \u201csurvival\u201d skills, and through planning and communication, it will\ncreate trustworthy and a\nsafe environment for its\npeople.\nA Vibrant city\nAthens will nurture and\ndevelop its assets in order\nto promote well-being,\ncreativity, entrepreneurship and a new, inclusive, and exciting identity.\nAthens will achieve effective and\nefficient governance and communicate and collaborate better with all its residents by fostering data driven policy making.\nGoal A\nBecome more transparent and accountable\nThe Athens city Council and administration seem remote and obscure to the citizen. Apart from the fact that there is no culture within the municipality that values, manages and maintains the collection of data and KPIs, there are also few and weak channels of communication both among the different levels of administration and between the City of Athens and the citizens. An \"open city\" is a city that is accountable, a city that can win back the trust of its people. For Athens to be resilient it needs to build trust. One of the main stresses that keep weakening the ability of the city to move forward, as well as the cohesion of Athenian society, is mistrust. The city is in the process of becoming moPrIeLLoApRe1n and transparent through opening channels of communication, its data and its procedures.\nAthens Digital Lab (ADL)\nAthens Digital Lab, funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, aims in the support and development of start-ups, focused in areas selected by the City of Athens, using IoT for \u201csmart cities\u201d technologies. Following an open call, teams of young professionals and scientists, and unemployed individuals can submit proposals, which in principle will focus on Athens and will provide innovative solutions to the basic problems of the city. Athens Digital Lab will host the teams for six months, in a fully equipped co-working space, located in a brand new municipal building, while providing the necessary field area and the necessary data. Executives from the Municipality of Athens high-tech companies will act as mentors and will actively participate in the development of the solutions, that could be evolved into integrated products. These products will be used by the City of Athens, and to then gain access to international and national sales channels.\nDescription:\nEvery city in the world is a living organism that constantly transforms as it updates its functions. Many factors affect the tasks and responsibilities of a city in a broad range of sectors. In order for a city to be able to best serve its people, there is a need to constantly monitor its performance, ideally on a real-time basis. Many cities around the world have already developed mechanisms and tools that measure their performance using state-of-the-art digital technologies. Tools such as digital and dynamic maps (GIS maps), dynamic databases on monitoring indicators, sensors and technologies (Internet of Things - IoT) are available for use by any city around the world.\nThe City of Athens is currently using obsolete technologies to measure its performance. This becomes more difficult due to insufficient human resources. On the other hand, Citizens are also unaware of what is happening in the city, while the city decision makers lack the proper tools for effective policy making.\nThe main objective here is to introduce up to date digital technologies to help better manage the City of Athens. city officials will thus be able to draft new policies using real-time data, while demonstrating to the public, for the first time, the dynamic status and performance of the city. The latter will be achieved thought a series of actions that will promote its transparency.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport Data-Driven Policy Making\n\u2022\tEnhance and Promote Communication Channels with the Citizens\n\u2022\tSupport Transparency and Accountability\n\u2022\tPromote Digital Adaptation\n\u2022\tSupport Integrated Planning and Strengthen Municipal Leadership\n\u2022\tDevelop Synergies with city Stakeholders and Enhance Participation\n\u2022\tRaise Awareness and Appreciation for the city and its Services\n\u2022\tPromote Citizens Well-being and Ameliorate their Quality of Life\n\u2022\tSimplify Bureaucratic Processes\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Chief Digital Officer (CDO), Office of Resilience and Sustainability (ORS), Deputy Mayor for Waste Management)\nPartners: citymart, Greek Service Providers, the Transatlantic Policy Lab (TAPL), National Center of Social Research, public utility companies\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal funds, the Bertelsmann Foundation, 100RC, private donors, structural funds Time frame: Short-term and Ongoing\nSDGs goals\nA.1.1 Digital repository\nAn effective transition from an analogue to a digital era is necessarily supported by the development of a Digital Repository that will accumulate the analogue and digital information of the city services in a single state-of-the-art digital repository. This will help city officials and departments gather city data in one place in a digitalized format.\nThe information will be gathered internally but will also be supported by data from external stakeholders such as Ministries, the Regional Authority, ongoing research programs, and University studies.\nThe main goal of this action is to build the foundation of the new digital era of the city.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Administration in collaboration with the CDO)\nPartners: Municipal Departments, private and Public Organizations that have already implemented studies for the city, Ministries, the Region of Attica.

The action includes the following:\na.\tDevelop a local government scorecard to foster transparency and allow for internal and external monitoring\n\u2022\tCreate a self-assessment to rate government performance at a district level\n\u2022\tPilot a digital \u201cpolling\u201d tool where citizens can rate all trust-building events and city services\nb.\tLaunch a data-visualization gallery to promote government transparency\n\u2022\tMake data collected by the city easily accessible and understandable\n\u2022\tAdd features that allow for community-influenced impact\n\u2022\tAsk companies that have a stake in user-centered (UCD) open innovation projects to share information and processing methods with users and residents.\nsmall businesses and stakeholders \u2022 Report in-person communication via the digital\nplatform to increase transparency d.Appoint specific responsibilities of participatory process and neighborhood outreach to the relevant municipal departments (Office for Social Innovation, city Districts Boards, Deputy Mayor for Municipal Decentralization, etc).\nAction Owner: City of Athens (ORS and CDO)\nPartners: TAPL, Municipal Departments, external stakeholders\nFunding sources: the Bertelsmann Foundation, 100RC, private donors Time frame: Short-term\nA.1.3 Public works calendar\nThe City of Athens, capital of the country, is the largest municipality in Greece that hosts the central core of activities for the whole country. Every day, public works are being undertaken across the city districts. Utility companies, transport organizations and other public or private entities implement public works and are obliged to issue a special works permit from the city services.\nIn many cases these permits are not issued and there is ambiguity on type and location. There is a need to start tracking these works in a single calendar so that all responsible parties are fully aware of what is happening.\nThis action is about developing an online common calendar that will capture all upcoming works, as well as potential guidance for the citizens (e.g. traffic arrangements). A MoU between the Municipality of Athens and the utility companies will be signed in order to set the framework. This is a first step towards a multilevel digital platform that will one day hold all relevant to the city functional information.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Public Works and ORS)\nPartners: Utility companies, Transport\nOrganizations, other public work companies (private or public) and municipal department.\nFunding sources: private donors, structural funds\nTime frame: Short-term\nc.\tEstablish a digital communications platform with an in-person outreach component\n\u2022\tMake all the relevant action items, due dates, parties involved and consequences for inaction accessible to the public\n\u2022\tCreate a feedback loop for NGOs, civil society,\nA.1.4 Fuel management platform and smart waste management monitoring system\nThe city needs to build an asset and fuel\nmanagement platform, utilizing heavy duty sensors in order to measure its assets and provide insight to its operational management through the use of notifications, alarms and reports.\nThis action focuses on two separate activities.\nThe first activity is a single management service\nfor fuel monitoring of petrol tanks. The city\nwill install monitoring sensors in petrol tanks in\nschools for a start and then apply the monitoring\nsystem to other facilities. The main objective is to\ncreate a live monitoring system that will provide\nuseful information on fuel consumption, create\na tank registry, keep historical data and provide\ninformation and reports for future actions.\nThe second activity is to develop a smart waste\nmanagement system by using sensors on waste\ntrucks and bins. That way, the waste management department will be able to monitor on a daily basis the efficiency of the waste collection system while keeping a record of other crucial data such as\nmaintenance, future procurements and reports for the development of new policies.\nAction Owner: City of Athens\nPartners: private sector and relevant municipal\ndepartments\nFunding sources: Municipal funds\nTime frame: Short-term\nA.1.5 Tree identity\nThe City of Athens currently owns over 120,000\ntrees which are growing within the city boundaries. There is however no existing registry for these trees. city services need to develop an application that will help build a register to record all of the tree characteristics such as their position, type, occupancy, age, classification, and canopy.\nThe city services have already started to record\nthe trees on a GIS map but there is a need to build\nthe capacity implement this work. A MoU with\nthe Agricultural University of Athens will support\nthe project by capitalizing on the expertise of its\nprofessors and students.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Department of Green and Parks)\nPartners: Platform Partner, Agricultural University,\nMunicipal Department of Green and Parks\nFunding sources: Municipal funds\nTime frame: Short-term\nA.1.6 Urban resilience indicators\nAthens has been the center of economic crisis,\nespecially local economy, socio-spatial relations,\nand civil unrest.\nThe main goal of this action is to develop and\nimplement Urban Resilience Indicators as a vehicle to map urban social processes in everyday life. Omonoia Square, the so-called heart of Athens, is an area which has experienced a significant decline in commercial activity. This area was used for one of our diagnostic activities to better understand how it could remain resilient in times of social and economic turmoil.\nThis action aims to develop a Transferable Toolkit\nthat will be extended to other areas of Athens\nin order to connect resilient urban planning\nand decision-making to the needs of Athenian\nneighborhoods.\nThe existing case study outcomes must be enhanced by statistical and sociological methodologies in order to make it more robust and transferable. expertise of its professors and students.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (ORS)\nPartners: UrbanDig Project, National Center of\nSocial Research, Municipal Departments\nFunding sources: Municipal funds\nTime frame: Short-term\nDescription:\nMistrust towards the central and local government constitutes one of the major resilience challenges for Athens. Due to the insufficient funding and the lack of cohesive structure the city cannot effectively communicate its priorities, programs and initiatives to the residents. Moreover, Athenians are particularly reluctant and dismissive towards municipal endeavors due to insufficient information and a lack of thorough communication strategies.\nThe city needs to better communicate its goals and actions to the people of Athens. It needs to upgrade its information and communication exchange with the citizens through the creation of a cross-media ongoing campaign, branching out to include a variety of stakeholder engagement tools through which the city will establish a more open relationship with the public. We are in the process of establishing a social media campaign focusing on issues related to waste collection and the role of the citizens in the city's cleanliness. The social media campaign can be the baseline upon which other opportunities for communication and stakeholder engagement should be explored and introduced, with a focus on different topics such as sustainable mobility campaign, promotion of existing social innovation platforms implemented by the city, anti-rumor campaign for migrants and refugees, gender equality and others.\nIn order to enhance the resilience of the action, the city's budget should include a percentage for each and every one of its projects \u201cinvested\u201d in communication with the city's residents. The city therefore needs to create a marketing and communications department that is both decentralized in the different municipal directorates and organizations, but also centralized and able to bring in the necessary human, technical and economic resources.\nome more transparent and\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport Transparency and Accountability\n\u2022\tSupport Integrated Planning and Strengthen Municipal Leadership\n\u2022\tEnhance and Promote Communication Channels with the Citizens\n\u2022\tDevelop Synergies with city Stakeholders and Enhance Participation\n\u2022\tRaise Awareness and Appreciations for the city and its Services\nAction Owners: City of Athens (OPANDA, Technopolis City of Athens, ADDMA, ORS)\nPartners: Bloomberg Associates, Marketing and Communication Agencies\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal funds Time frame: Short-term and Ongoing SDGs goals\nDescription:\nThe City of Athens regularly collaborates with partners to co-host cultural, sporting, and community events across the city.

This action constitutes a data-driven and evidence-based solution to the way social services and benefits operate, and it will rationalize the fragmented and dispersed system through which social services are currently being delivered. The variety and complexity of the residents' needs underlines the urgency for a holistic approach.\nThe two components of the Integrated Social Services Network are: A) the installation of a Case Management System - an online platform for social benefits and service applications that allows for digital submission assessment, follow-up and feedback for each applicant. B) the transformation of one Health Clinic to a Multi-service Municipal Centre offering both social and health services.\nCurrently, the City of Athens is piloting this action through the operation of the Municipal Health Centre at Chanion Str. (6th city district) as a Multi-social Service Centre. This center provides services such as Medical Care, Psychosocial Support Services, Job Instruction and Legal Support. The pilot operation of an Information Technology System connects beneficiaries with other services (information and referral system and case management).\nIn the health sector, the centers could provide accessible healthcare throughout the city, focusing on diagnostic tests and primary care. Each center will cater specifically to the needs of the surrounding community, including primary care services, first aid and health education programs.\nThis model should be replicated in the remaining 5 iistricts.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport Integrated Planning and Strengthen Municipal Leadership\n\u2022\tSupport iata-driven Policy Making\n\u2022\tRaise Awareness and Appreciation for the City and its Services\n\u2022\tSimplify Bureaucratic Processes\n\u2022\tMaximize the iynamic of the Athenian Neighborhood\n\u2022\tPromote Equitable, Cohesive and Supportive Communities\n\u2022\tPromote Citizens Wellbeing and Ameliorate their Quality of Life\nAction Owners: ieputy Mayor of Social Solidarity,\nWelfare &Equality\nPartners: Athens Partnership, Bloomberg Associates Legislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal and European Funding\nTime frame: Short-term\nSDGs goals\nB.4\nMap of the public realm\nDescription:\nThere is a strong ambition to improve the public realm in Athens and to increase the use of public space by its citizens. Currently, public spaces are downgraded and poorly maintained due to insufficient resources and planning. Additionally, the illegal occupation of public space constitutes a continuous challenge for Athenians and affects their quality of life.\nThe City of Athens will map all public open space areas across the city in order to create a dynamic registry and to have an overview and understanding of what currently occupies the public space (vehicles, street furniture, tables and chairs, trees, etc.). The city wants to identify any obstacles that make the city less walkable and appealing. This exercise will set the baseline for a public realm strategy and will help the city understand how these spaces can be improved.\nThis exercise will set the baseline for a public realm strategy and will help the city understand how these spaces can be improved and how an effective control system can be established. A special group consisting on major city architects and urban planners has already been assembled in order to advise the Mayor and propose solutions for public space design and usage, starting with the historic and commercial center of Athens.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport Integrated Planning and Strengthen Municipal Leadership\n\u2022\tSupport Data-driven Policy Making\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tMitigate black economy in the City\n\u2022\tDevelop Synergies with City Stakeholders and Enhance\nPa rticipation\n\u2022\tPromote Citizens Wellbeing and Ameliorate their Quality of Life\n\u2022\tPromote Sustainable Management and Development\nAction Owners: Deputy Mayor of Commerce,\nDevelopment and Public Space Management\nPartners: universities, research centers, Athens\nDevelopment and Destination Management Agency\n(ADDMA), private sector\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal funds\nTime frame: Short-term\nSDGs goals\nGoal C\nFoster collaboration and engagement\nThe City of Athens has managed to survive the recent socioeconomic crisis by forging collaborations among the public, private and civic sectors. This is an increasingly important\naspect of city governance and it is absolutely crucial in\nforging city resilience. This collaboration encourages\ninnovation and is a key aspect of effective city governance.\nIn order to foster resilience, the existing and proposed\ninitiatives have to be streamlined, upscaled and replicated.\nAssessing and evaluating their impact will be a significant\nstep towards a robust and integrated city fabric.\nC.1\nThematic stakeholder platforms\nDescription:\nThe city recognized the need to create a platform that includes all of the CSOs and NGOs dealing with health and social services, in order to better communicate to the municipal departments which outside partners are available to assist with the citizens needs. Therefore, the city launched the Social Integration Initiative (SII) that now has more than 160 registered organizations offering health and social services. The civil employees can refer to the platform in order to determine which services are most appropriate to meet the needs of the beneficiaries in case the city does not meet these needs.\nThis platform could be further expanded so as to include other services provided by the city such as partners in the private sector that can support the cities entrepreneurial initiatives and research and other partners related to greening the city. Additionally, organizations and municipal departments could provide updates on activities and open stable channels of communication through the SII platforms.\nIn order to achieve greater dissemination and effective impact of these platforms, a crowd-sourcing element should be added. NGOs, research centers and other organizations that wish to connect with the relevant municipal departments will have the opportunity to register directly.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport Integrated Planning and Strengthen Municipal Leadership\n\u2022\tSupport Data-driven Policy Making\n\u2022\tRaise Awareness and Appreciation for the City and its Services\n\u2022\tPromote Equitable, Cohesive and Supportive communities\n\u2022\tDevelop Synergies with City Stakeholders and Enhance Participation\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Social Solidarity Welfare and Equality, ORS)\nPartners: Other Deputy Mayors and relevant municipal departments, Bloomberg Associates, CSOs and NGOs, private sector.\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal funds\nTime frame: Medium -term\nSDGs goals\nC.2\nsynAthina platform\nDescription:\nIn July 2013 the City of Athens launched the awarded synAthina platform in order to establish a permanent and effective link between its services and the Athenian NGOs as well as the informal grassroots groups. This is a platform where citizen groups can connect with each other and suggest activities that contribute to the improvement of the quality of life for the Athenians.\nsynAthina is a common space that brings together, supports and facilitates citizens' groups engaged in improving the quality of life in the city. By coordinating the invaluable resource of the citizens' groups, the City of Athens actively listens to the needs of its people.. By supporting the activities of the citizens the city creates a new perception of the relationship between civic society and local governance and cultivates their dynamic bond.\nThe main goal of the platform is to help simplify municipal procedures and strengthen citizen participation in the decision-making process. It also aims to encourage citizens to collaborate and network across all seven districts. Moreover, it will suggest educational programs and workshops to help co-create solutions that address small-scale urban issues.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport Integrated Planning and Strengthen Municipal Leadership\n\u2022\tSupport Data-driven Policy Making\n\u2022\tRaise Awareness and Appreciation for the City and its Services\n\u2022\tPromote Equitable, Cohesive and Supportive communities\n\u2022\tDevelop Synergies with City Stakeholders and Enhance Participation\n\u2022\tSupport and Promote Local Human Talent\n\u2022\tInvest in Local Capacity Building\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Civil Society and Social Innovation and the Office for Innovation)\nPartners: Bloomberg Philanthropies, CSOs and NGOs Legislative authority:\nFunding sources: Bloomberg Philanthropies Time frame: Long-term SDGs goals\n73\nC.3\nUniversity and city synergies\nDescription:\nSeveral major academic and research Institutions are\nlocated within city boundaries. Academic stakeholders\nsuch as professors, students and researchers are\ncontinually implementing studies and innovative\nprojects that address important issues for the City\nof Athens. During the first year of its operations, the\nOffice of Resilience and Sustainability met with many\nstakeholders from the academic and research sector,\nand collaborations have already been forged during both the city's diagnostic phase and the Resilience Strategy design.\nUp to date, the city has been fostering and encouraging\nsuch collaborations on an ad hoc basis. Through the\nAthens Development and Destination Management\nAgency and the INNOVATHENS Hub of Innovation and\nEntrepreneurship of Technopolis City of Athens, the city\nhas provided new opportunities to young scientists and\nsupported startups and incubators.\nThe main objective of this action is to establish and\nstandardize long-term collaborations with the academic\nand research sector by developing a holistic approach to better use this crucial for the city resource.\nThis can be achieved by connecting university professors, laboratories and students with municipal departments, opening two-way channels of communications, co-\norganize master classes, events and conferences and\nfinally institutionalizing typologies of collaboration that\nwill sustain an ongoing dialogue with the academic\ncommunity regarding major municipal endeavors.\nBeneficial to the city University synergies should also\nbe established directly with the city communities and\nneighborhoods. The Municipality should\/could provide\nfacilitation and motivation. The ORS together with the\nAthens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)\nhave been developing a framework that sees the\nUniversity as a major actor in community development,\nfostering social and business connections with the people that live around Victoria Square and the Kypseli area of the 6th District. Encouraging the university to play a more active role in shaping the district's future will be beneficial to the university, its students and the area's residents.\nFurthermore, engaging student and young people at\nthe community level is beneficial for the entire city. The\nErasmus Student Network through its contacts with the\nORS has already been mobilizing, designing up-cycling\nplatform that would benefit the large migrant and refugee populations of the area as well as a \u201cbuddy system\u201d for young refugees.

Through its non-profit fiscal sponsor, New Venture Fund, the Athens Partnership supports innovative public programs - in health, education, community development and other areas of need. The Partnership is an independent, nonpartisan entity that relies on contributions from foundations, corporations and individuals.\nThrough the Athens Partnership, infrastructure projects and initiatives are supported in order to strengthen social cohesion, economic growth and overall quality of life in the city. The Athens Partnership aims to attract donations from foundations, businesses and individuals, including the Greek Diaspora.\nThe organization's operation follows the most modern standards of accountability, transparency and effectiveness, with a special focus on financing innovative and pilot projects that, through modern technology transfer, benefit not only the city but also the municipality. As an independent organization working between the City of Athens and the private sector, it combines the strengths of both to the benefit of the Athenian residents who are the ultimate beneficiaries.\nThe Athens Partnership follows the tradition of successful models being in operation for many years in other major cities, such as London, New York, Los Angeles and Melbourne, where nonprofit organizations collaborate creatively with municipalities in areas of vital importance, such as sustainable development and the fight against poverty and the economic crisis. Thus, the Athens Partnership has capitalized on the experience we have gained and has upgraded the quality of our cooperation with all of those who intend to help.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tPromote citizens' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\n\u2022\tInvest in local capacity building\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Social Solidarity Welfare and Equality)\nPartners: private donors, Bloomberg Associates, New Venture Funds, Various Foundations\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: National and International private donors\nTime frame: Medium-term\nSDGs goals\nC.5\nAthens Culture Net\nDescription:\nThe Athenian culture scene is dynamic, diverse and exceptionally interesting. Museums, galleries, private collections, theaters, performances, and emerging artists are all putting their mark on the city's cultural identity. Over the past few years, major institutions have been developing successful and innovative projects regardless the continuous economic recession.\nThe City of Athens created the Athens Culture Net (ACN) in order to connect with the city's major cultural institutions. The ACN, operating in partnership with the local government, is a network that promotes the exchange of ideas, encourages collaboration, and shares best practices and resources. This is to to help Athens to stand out as a destination of cultural production, creative entrepreneurship and social integration. The network focuses, in particular, on the potential impact that art events can have on public space and urban fabric.\nThe city will explore ways to promote the ACN and enhance its sustainability in the future. The network should create added value to the city's cultural capital, promote common strategies between different organizations and contribute to the This Is Athens city brand. The ACN should gradually open its scope to include other cultural institutions. The first step could be the adoption of the Small Museums of Athens Network as well as smaller and more niche artistic initiatives.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tSupport and promote the local human talent\n\u2022\tInvest in local capacity building\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance\nparticipation\n\u2022\tSupport transparency and accountability\n\u2022\tEnhance and promote communication channels with the\ncitizens\n\u2022\tPromote local culture\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Mayor's Office)\nPartners: Athens Partnership, Major Cultural Institutions, Other artistic and cultural networks\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: Athens Partnership Time frame: Medium-term\nSDGs goals\nGoal A\nIntegrate natural systems into the urban fabric\nAthens, a city that suffers from heatwaves, flash floods and poor air quality, has historically wasted, misused and mismanaged its natural resources.

These large areas fall under the jurisdiction of different authorities. The City of Athens, the Region of Attica, the Ministry of Energy and Environment are some of the key players that need to collaborate and commit economic and other resources managing these green areas.\nFor example, According to the Presidential Decree (No.187\/16-06-2011) article 3, the Management Authority for two major Metropolitan parks, those of Goudi and Ilisia, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Energy and Environment and more specifically the \u201cUrban, Suburban and Metropolitan Areas Planning Directorate.\u201d In a similar vein, large areas such as Pedio Areos, Attiko Alsos, Elaionas, Zappeion, LofosArditou should be considered as high priority spaces for the larger metropolitan area, and swiftly establish a) clear juridical authorities, b) budget lines and c) realistic, efficient and sustainable maintenance and development plans.\nThe city will initiate the conversation with all the involved parties to collaborate with different levels of government (Region, Ministry of Energy and Environment, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Finance) in order to be able to proceed. This should lead to the creation of a cross sectoral managing authority for most of the important green spaces in Athens (Pedio Areos, Attiko Alsos, Lofos Arditou, Zappeion).\nRegarding the other major green areas that fall under municipal jurisdiction, the city has to design and implement sustainable and realistic plans, in order to be able to maintain and develop them. These are urban assets that have been underappreciated and under monitored. New collaborations should be forged with both the private and the civil sectors in order to achieve such a goal. The city will start with the revival of the National Park and the Hill of Lycabetus, two important city landmarks.\nThis action will give back to Athenians appealing large green open spaces where they can walk, meet with friend, exercise, celebrate, bring some nature into their lives, let their children play. It will have a direct effect on the quality of everyday life as well as the city identity and the branding of Athens, gradually attracting more residents and maximizing the possibility for capital investments. All this is without taking into considerations the enormous benefits vis-a-vis the shocks and stresses that climate change brings to the city.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tRaise awareness and appreciation for the City and its services\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tSimplify bureaucratic processes\n\u2022\tProtect and maintain critical infrastructure\n\u2022\tEnhance city's identity\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tSupport and enhance natural environment\n\u2022\tPromote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Dept of Parks and Green and ORS)\nPartners: All relevant authorities, Urban Lab, CSO's and NGOs, private sector\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: National, Structural and Municipal funds, private sector Funding Timeframe: Long-term SDGs goals\nThe idea of moving the stadium of the beloved Athens\nsoccer-ball team Panathinaikos away from the center of\nAthens is not new. Several solutions have been discussed during the last couple of decades and respective plans have drawn and advanced to different stages.\nThe project regained political and media interest in the\nbeginning of April 2017 following a meeting initiated\nby the Greek Prime Minister Mr. Alexis Tsipras with the\nMayor of Athens Mr. Giorgos Kaminis. The discussion\nwhich brought back to the forefront the relocation of\nPapathinaikos Stadium to the Goudi area plan.\nThe liberation of the densely populated residential area\nof Alexandras Avenue from the nuisance of the traffic\ncongestion, noise and generalized unrest that each\nsoccer-ball match brings to the neighborhood would be a benefit. Adding to this, the plan is to create a large green area that connects the stadium lots with the so-called\n\u201cRefugee Buildings\u201d across the Avenue adds significantly to its appeal.\nThe Refugee Buildings of Alexandras Avenue are an old-fashioned, almost ramshackle urban formation consisting of eight parallelogram-shaped blocks with a total 228\napartments, very few of which are inhabited today. They were built between 1933 and 1935 to host Refugees arriving in Athens after the Asia Minor war of 1922. In 2009 the whole complex was characterized as a listed buildings, for their historical, cultural, socio-political and architectural heritage value. Today their future use is throttled by legislative decisions that have halted any further development.\nThe plan of connecting via the creation of a large green\narea the two sides of Alexandras Avenue, by submerging or lifting above ground part of the Avenue, would bring benefits that far succeed the particular area. The densely build Athens center is today starving for green open\nspaces that can revive and boost the development of\nthe particular neighborhoods, creating jobs, attracting\ninvestments, but also support Athens' climate resilience\nmitigating extreme heat, flash floods and bad air quality. The same project proposes to design and develop two large and largely abandoned green areas that spill over several municipalities of the metropolitan area: the Goudi Metropolitan Park and the Double Development Area in Elaionas.\nSeveral announcements of different versions of such\ndevelopmental projects have created a negative\nprecedent. Due to the chronic delays in advance any of\nthese proposals, the conflicting interests of stakeholders, as well as the total absence of proper communication and consultation channels with the Athenian public, this whole proposal should go forth building on a robust process of advocacy, municipal diplomacy, stakeholder engagement.\nGoal A\nIntegrate natural systems into the urban fabric\n\u2022 Support integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022 Initiate a Major Regeneration Project\n\u2022 Promote the quality of life and the well-being of the citizens\n\u2022 Take measures for Climate Change adaptation \u2022 Support data-driven policy making \u2022 Enhance city's identity\n\u2022 Create a sense of belonging and ownership\n\u2022 Maximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood \u2022 Develop synergies with various city stakeholders and\nenhance community participation \u2022 Promote equitable, cohesive and supportive\ncommunities\nCross - Jurisdictional Authority (consists mainly for the following partners)\nPartners: City of Athens, Region of Attica, Central Government, platform partners, Athens Development and Destination Management Agency, private sector, Adjacent Municipalities, Panathinaikos FC, universities and research centers, NGOs and CSOs\nFunding Sources: structural funds, Regional Funds, Municipal funds, NSFR 2014-2020 Timeframe: Long-term \/ aspirational\nThe urban district of Elaionas is a post-industrial area, which is currently regulated to accommodate light industrial uses, logistics and crafts. The overall district has substantial green open spaces (assigned as such by Presidential decree) distributed among the neighborhood blocks.\nHowever, the district remains underutilized because of lack of critical infrastructures, such as roads, sewage and streetscape, political will and investment interest. The current situation is to a large extent a result of conflicting interests, regulatory hurdles, and a lack of a clear vision, that could bring the different levels of government into a dynamic collaboration transforming this areas potential into an amazing part of the city. Apart from the central government administration delaying the implementation of critical infrastructure work in the area, the Athens municipality has also not completed the required urban studies for 30% of the Elaionas (approx. 45 hectares), as it also lacks adequate funding for the expropriation the provisioned spaces.\nThe envisioned project includes the revitalization of the entire district with a complete transformation, starting from the required infrastructures. As the city owns substantial land in the area, it is proposed that such real estate is utilized to provide (co-)working spaces for the creative and clean-tech industries in order to create an innovation district, of co-creation, green development and clean-tech innovation. The municipality can explore the potential for new modes of collaborative city-making in a networked society. For example the municipality can set the operational, land-use, and environmental framework, inviting proposals from Athenian architects, urban planners and landscape architects for the design of the different lots it owns. The principles will be those of innovation, holistic sustainable management (energy and waste neutral, high green ration, circular economy, etc) and urban well being providing the district with new types of sport facilities.\nFor the initiation of the above vision, the following actions\/studies are required:\n\u2022\turban studies for the remaining part of the district (45 hectares)\n\u2022\ttechnical studies for the main infrastructure, under municipal authority\n\u2022\tstrategic and business plan for the utilization of municipal real estate and its sustainable development\n\u2022\tcollaborative city-making methodology pilot\nGoal A\nIntegrate natural systems into the urban fabric\n\u2022\tEnhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022\tievelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tMitigate black economy in the city\n\u2022\tCombine essential services with dynamic urban development\n\u2022\tInvest in local capacity building\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tProtect and maintain critical infrastructure\n\u2022\tEnhance city's identity\n\u2022\tPromote local culture\n\u2022\tSupport and promote the human talent\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tSupport and enhance natural environment\n\u2022\tPromote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owners: City of Athens (relevant departments and ORS)\nPartners: Region of Attica, platform partners, AiiMA, universities, Athens ievelopment and iestination Management Agency, Ministry of Economy and ievelopment, Creative Industries\nFunding Sources: structural funds, Regional Funds,\nMunicipal funds, NSFR 2014-2020\nTimeframe: Long-term\nGoal B\nMake our city cleaner\nThe city has been struggling with, keeping its public spaces clean, free of \"noise\" and pollution. This important \"quality of life\" issue is a crucial indicator of effectiveness and accountability. Developing a forward looking and data driven waste management plan is among the top most priorities of our city's resilience.\nI\nWaste management action plan\nDescription:\nThe City of Athens Sanitation Directorate carries out the collection of municipal waste. This involves a 24-hour service, which operates 365 days a year. Currently there are 178 different waste collection programs implemented by the Waste Collection Department of the Sanitation Directorate. These programs serve the 664,046\npermanent residents of the city and almost 4.000.000\ntourists per year.\nThere is a need to develop and implement a Resilient\nWaste Management Action Plan that will include new\nmodels of waste management tailor-made for Athens.\nThe Resilient Waste Management Action Plan will be\nfully aligned with the Local Waste Management Plan\nthat was submitted to the Region of Attica. Currently,\nthe Resilience and Sustainability Office is in close\ncollaboration with the Mayor, the General Secretary and\nthe Deputy Mayor for Waste Management creating a new and improved Operational\/Business Plan. In parallel, the Resilience Office asked from ARUP (our Strategy Partner) to develop a waste study (assessment of existing state of affairs and proposed future actions) and organized a problem-framing workshop in collaboration with 100RC Platfrom Partner,citymart. The results of these two\nstudies, together with the development of a Modeling\nand Mapping Tool in collaboration with Findyr (100RC\nplatform partner) consist the basis for the development\nof a Resilient Waste Management Action Plan.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022 Support data-driven policy making\n\u2022 Enhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022 Support transparency and accountability\n\u2022 Promote digital adaptation\n\u2022 Develop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022 Support integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022 Raise awareness and appreciation for the city and its services\n\u2022 Maximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022 Combine essential services with dynamic urban development\n\u2022 Invest in local capacity building\n\u2022 Promote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022 Simplify bureaucratic processes\n\u2022 Protect and maintain critical infrastructure\n\u2022 Enhance city's identity\n\u2022 Provide incentives for economic development\n\u2022 Promote sustainable management and development\n\u2022 Support and enhance natural environment\n\u2022 Promote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022 Maximize urban assets\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Mayor, General Secretary, Deputy Mayor for Waste Management and Cleaning Services, ORS)\nPartners: citymart, Findyr, ATHENA Research Center\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal funds Timeframe: Short and Ongoing\nSDGs goals\nB.1\nWaste management action plan\nB.1.1 Efficient waste management logistics\nThe City of Athens currently has limited resources to keep the city clean. The economic crisis has led to public budget cuts, more bureaucratic and time-consuming public procurement, as well as reductions in staffing. As a result, current waste management and cleaning service programs are inefficient and in a state of continual crisis.\nThe city needs to improve its logistics by combining the purchase of new equipment and the efficient management of equipment, human resources and available budget. The local waste management action plan proposes several logistics actions such as the development of a waste transfer station.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Mayor, General Secretary, Deputy Mayor for Waste Management and Cleaning Services)\nPartners: citymart, Findyr, ATHENA Research Center\nB.1.3 Design and enhance stakeholder engagement in waste management\nDuring the implementation of Phase II of the Resilient Athens Program, the collaboration with citymart and ARUP has provided new innovative proposed solutions in waste management. Citizens must play a crucial role to help improve the process of waste collection and city cleanliness. Waste and cleaning of the city are the most important aspects of the everyday life of the Athenians and measures need to be taken by both the city services and the citizens.\nstakeholder stakeholder engagement action plan will be designed in order to support the communication and awareness campaigns, together with the supportive actions that will take place in parallel.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Mayor, General Secretary, Deputy Mayor for Waste Management and Cleaning Services)\nFunding sources: Municipal funds\tPartners: citymart, Findyr, ATHENA Research\nCenter, CSOs and NGOs, synAthina\nTime frame: Short-term\nFunding sources: Municipal funds Time frame: Short-term\nB.1.2. Design a forward-looking and innovative recycle and reuse program for athens\nThe Recycle and Reuse Program in Athens is not working properly. Several problems, such as lack of bins, broken trucks and lack of human resources, have reduced the capacity of the recycling programs in Athens. On the other hand, the collaboration with the Hellenic Recovery Recycling Corporation (He.r.r.Co) is under evaluation by both parties, and even though the contract between the parties is overdue there is a need to redefine the scope of work towards a more efficient Recycling\/ Reuse Program.\nThis action includes also the development of integrated \u201cGreen\u201d Points in the city. These points will directly alleviate the current collection and transportation problems.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Mayor, General Secretary, Deputy Mayor for Waste Management and Cleaning Services)\nPartners: citymart, Findyr, ATHENA Research Center\nFunding sources: Municipal funds\nTimeframe: Short-term\nB.1\nWaste management action plan\nB.1.4 Incorporate data provided by the city on a daily basis\nThis action is emerging from the need the city has for open and digital data. As mentioned in the previous actions, performance monitoring of many city activities is crucial, and that is especially true for the waste management and cleaning services of the city. Currently, city services monitor the performance through analogue data and hard copies. Due to the lack of capacity, this monitoring is insufficient and many times with no results.\nThe main objective is to digitalize the whole process and to targetg two main areas. The first goal is to develop new data-driven policies and the second is to demonstrate the performance of the city's waste management services to the citizens.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Mayor, General Secretary, Deputy Mayor for Waste Management and Cleaning Services)\nPartners: citymart, Findyr, ATHENA Research\nCenter\nFunding sources: Municipal funds\nTime frame: Short-term\nB.1.5 Value and job creation through circular economy\nThe circular economy provides solutions for many environmental, economic and geopolitical challenges that cities worldwide are facing. It provides the next step in resilience building, as it transforms waste into critical resources.\nAthens should do an opportunity mapping in order to identify which of its sectors can make the most impact in: value creation, job creation, better air quality and reduction in CO2 emissions, competitiveness in global markets, and reduction in resource use. It seems like our household waste system, and specifically our organic waste chain, could be a potential driver for the transition to circularity, i.e. one of the sectors that we could focus on in order to develop innovative strategies on how to extract value and create jobs.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Mayor, General Secretary, Deputy Mayor for Waste Management and Cleaning Services, ORS)\nPartners: Citymart, Rebuild by Design, Veolia\nFunding sources: Municipal funds, 100RC\nTime frame: Medium-term to long-term\nBest Practices: Amsterdam \/\/ Glassgow \/\/ New York\nGoal C\nPromote sustainable mobility and co-create public spaces\nThe city has been struggling with, keeping its public\nspaces clean, free of \"noise\" and pollution.

Design questions in Athens must be approached in the expectation that the city will reshape itself throughout its life, building resilience into the development model as a result. Crucially, this adaptive perspective will allow for different modes of intervention in different conditions, whether stable or fleeting.\nA seminar will be organized by ISOCARP and Resilient Athens during 2017 with 13 local urban planners\/architects and 13 members of ISOCARP (HABITAT 3 Urban Agenda)\nSustainable mobility roadmap\nDescription:\nCurrently, there is a high dependency on cars to move around the city. There is limited public transportation infrastructure and therefore an increase in traffic congestion and poor air quality. In order to address these challenges, the Athens Mobility Forum will be responsible for leading the process of implementing Athens Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP).\nThe Forum could eventually evolve into the Athens Mobility Agency which would be the governing body for the delivery of the SUMP. It can ensure that the plan is coordinated with all the relevant stakeholders across all city scales.\nThe main objectives of the Athens Mobility Forum are the following:\n1.\tInstitutional framework and governance\n2.\tMulti-scale approach to urban mobility\n3.\tHolistic and multimodal approach to urban mobility\n4.\tIncremental implementation of a mobility plan\nThe first steps to be taken by the Municipality are described in the supporting actions.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport data-driven policy making\n\u2022\tEnhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022\tSupport transparency and accountability\n\u2022\tPromote digital adaptation\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leaderships\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tCombine essential services with dynamic urban\ndevelopment\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tEnhance city's identity\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tSupport and enhance natural environment\n\u2022\tPromote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owners: City of Athens (General Secretary and relevant departments)\nPartners: Technical University of Athens, Green fund, Ministry of Environment and Energy\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal and structural funds Timeframe: Medium-term\nSDGs goals\nC.1\nSustainable mobility roadmap\nC.1.1 Sustainable urban mobility plan\nCurrently the City of Athens is developing a strategic plan for urban mobility.

The Region of Attica has allocated a budget of 10 million Euros for the construction of the north axis of a cycling lane which is currently in progress.\nFollowing the development of the North axis that connects Gazi to Kifisia, the Urban Cycling plan suggests the following actions:\n\u2022 Promote cycling in the Athens Historical and Commercial Triangle\n\u2022 Create new cycle lanes that connect the basic North and South axes\n\u2022 Create new parking lots for bicycles \u2022 Implement communication and information campaigns for younger ages\n\u2022 Incorporate bicycle in the touristic development of the city\nCrowd-sourcing has been successfully used as an online problem solving and production model that presents great potential in the area of bicycle route planning. It taps into the collective intelligence of networked communities to co-create and support local policies and programs, as well as improve\ncommunity engagement. We suggest that the first bicycle routes designed for the center of Athens should also take in to consideration the desires and proposals that the city will crowd-source through an open call to the Athens bicycle communities.\nAction Owner: City of Athens, Resilience and Sustainability Office\nPartners: private donors, Athens Partnership, Technical University of Athens, platform partners Funding sources: structural funds, Municipal funds Time frame: Medium-term\nBest Practices Copenhagen, Boston and New York\nC.1\nSustainable mobility roadmap\nC.1.3 Extend the pedestrian zones in the city\nCurrently, the City of Athens implements a pilot project in the Athens Commercial Triangle that mainly focuses on the creation of pedestrian areas. The city services have allocated funds for the extension of these pedestrian zones in the surrounding areas. The main objective is to replicate these actions to other city districts.

The city is currently developing new\nstrategies aiming at revitalizing and regenerating these\nareas. One of them is the OPANDA initiative Culture\nDefeats Darkness that supports and brings cultural\nactivities to heavily degraded urban areas. The end goal\nof this initiative is to regenerate depressed areas by\nbringing back the life to their public spaces. The city will\nupscale this methodology in depressed but liveable areas such as Victoria square and parts of Kypseli district. This will include a series of performances, cultural events, and small-scale cultural interventions supported by digital\ntechnologies. The project will be enforced by synergies\nbetween major cultural organizations in order to\nmaximize its visibility and success. The action builds on\nthis belief in order to cultivate a new approach for Athens; public space and to enforce the productive collaborations between the municipal government and city's cultural\norganizations.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022 Support integrated planning and strengthens municipal leadership\n\u2022 Raise awareness and appreciation for the City and its services\n\u2022 Maximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022 Invest in local capacity building\n\u2022 Promote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022 Develop synergies with various city stakeholders and enhance community participation\n\u2022 Contribute to a cleaner environment\n\u2022 Promote the quality of life and the well-being of the citizens\nAction Owners: City of Athens (ORS)\nPartners: universities, synAthina platform, Deputy Mayor for Social Innovation and Civil Society, Civil Society, City Districts, OPANDA, Athens Culture Net, Major Cultural\nOrganizations\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal and structural funds Timeframe: Medium-term\nSDGs goals\nPublic space co-development\nframework\nC.3\nDescription:\nAthens' public space has been heavily neglected over the past few years. Well-maintained streets, curbs, sidewalks, lighting, transit stations, parks and facilities signal a sense of well-being and municipal responsiveness that needs to be restored in the mind of Athenians.\nThe city will draft and implement a policy regarding the maintenance of public space that will take into consideration the limited municipal funds as well as Athens' human capital. We will develop an action framework that will combine several Trans-Atlantic Policy Lab (TAPL) proposals along with two EU funding proposals (Urban Innovative Action and ICT-11-2017 \u201cCollective awareness platform for sustainability and social innovation\u201d) in order to foster collaborations around public space maintenance and co-creation, and to catalyze participatory activities in the city.\nThe action framework will be based on the following project ideas:\n1.\tWe Are Athens Initiative:\nLaunch the We Are Athens initiative to beautify the 3rd and 6th districts and support the long-term maintenance of public space. We Are Athens seeks to develop a sense of community responsibility by empowering residents, visitors, homeowners, renters, business owners and NGOs to define the quality of life in their communities and establish a culture that supports the maintenance of public space.\n2.\tAthens Creates program:\nThe Athens Creates program aims to embed art into public space, which proposes a creative placemaking program that promotes public life in the 3rd and 6th districts. Athens Creates is composed of a series of temporary placemaking interventions that are hands-on and participatory. Given the municipality's limited budget, temporary interventions will produce the best results.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport data-driven policy making\n\u2022\tEnhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022\tSupport transparency and accountability\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tRaise awareness and appreciation for the City and its services\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tSupport and promote local human talent\n\u2022\tCombine essential services with dynamic urban development\n\u2022\tInvest in local capacity building\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tSimplify bureaucratic processes\n\u2022\tProtect and maintain critical infrastructure\n\u2022\tEnhance city's identity\n\u2022\tPromote local culture\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tSupport and enhance natural environment\n\u2022\tPromote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Commerce, Development and Public Space Management\nand ORS)\nPartners: TAPL, universities, NGOs and CSOs, research centers, Urban Lab, Deputy Mayor for Social Innovation and Civil Society, City Districts, OPANDA\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: TAPL and Municipal funds Timeframe: Medium-term\nSDGs goals\nGoal D\nFoster sustainable food systems\nThe City of Athens needs to develop sustainable and resilient food systems. The economic crisis has left a significant part of the population unable to meet its basic food needs. It has increased oligopolies in food distribution. It also generally affected the quality of food consumed, increasing dependency on processed and imported foods, resulting in health problems and obesity among vulnerable poGpOulAaLt iDons.\tGOAL E\nSustainable food policy plan\nDescription:\nThe Municipality of Athens is in the process of designing and implementing a Sustainable Food Policy. The process started through an URBACT Sustainable Food Network. URBACT managed to mobilize and attract diverse people, among them members of the city Council and the city Administration, experts, chefs and researchers, as well as different civil society organizations and actors. A Local Action Plan has already been drafted. Next, the city needs to form a Food Council, invite stakeholders, open the dialogue and define the Council's function within the administration. We want the Council to set the framework for a sustainable food system in our city. The Council will facilitate the dialogue between the civil society and the Municipality's decision-making bodies in the three food focal areas: production, distribution and appreciation of good food. The goal is to ensure urban food resilience as well as nutritional education and security, support and enhance the blooming food entrepreneurship and tourism in Athens, connect with peri-urban food producing municipalities, procure green food and minimize food waste across all steps of the metabolism of the city.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport data-driven policy making\n\u2022\tEnhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022\tSupport transparency and accountability\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tInvest in local capacity building\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tEnhance city's identity\n\u2022\tPromote local culture\n\u2022\tSupport and promote the human talent\n\u2022\tChampion developmental instead of humanitarian approaches\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tSupport and enhance natural environment\n\u2022\tPromote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owners: City of Athens (ADDMA and ORS)\nPartners: C40 Food Network, Milano Urban Food Policy Pact Steering Committee, Bloomberg Associates, Deputy Mayor for Children, Deputy Mayor for Migration and Refugees, Deputy Mayor for Civil Society and Social Innovation\nLegislative authority:\nFunding Sources: Municipal and private funds imeframe: Short-term, Ongoing\nDGs goals\nD.1\nSustainable food policy plan\nDm.p1.l1emI ent a local action plan\nAt the moment, Athens has a developed a local action plan that includes the following key actions:\na.\tIntroduce the concept sustainable food systems to the Municipality, b.

Making it a beautiful and vibrant Athenian Food Hub can be easily envisaged. It is currently in decay and disarray. The City of Athens will design a refurbishment plan, which includes a restoration plan for the old train-station-looking building (early 1900) and the surrounding area including Varvakeios square, and a feasibility, logistics and management plan regarding its shop owners. Varvakeios Food Hub is an entrepreneurial node involving all aspects related to food. At the moment, its basic operation is retail food selling. This could be enhanced so that Varvakeios becomes a 24-hour cultural and tourism center combined with the multifaceted thematic of food.\nAction Owner: City of Athens, (General Secretary and ORS)\nPartners: OKAA (Central Markets and Fishery Organizations), Panteion University, Athens Development and Destination Management Agency (ADDMA), Bloomberg Associates\nFunding sources: Own funding and private Public\nPartnerships\nTimeframe: Short-term to medium-term\nTime frame: Medium-term\nD.1\nSustainable food policy plan\nD.1.3 Towards zero food waste\nThe City of Athens has been addressing food poverty through municipal solidarity structures such as KYADA (City of Athens Hospitality and Solidarity Center) and a robust set of social welfare policies. And while in 2012 the eligible applicants for food support were around 7000 people, today there are around 25,000 people who receive a food basket or food coupons weekly. In addition to the municipal efforts, there is a significant bottom-up movement of SCOs and NGOs that today provide food and food-related services, including Boroume which up-cycles leftover food.\nThe City of Athens will build a strategy that reduces significantly food waste, with a 2050-zero-food-waste target.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (ORS)\nPartners: Bloomberg Associates, Boroume, WWF, SynAthina, Feeding5000 Funding sources: National and private funds Time frame: Medium-term to Long-term\nD.1.4 School street market pilot project\nIn a municipality with high unemployment and elevated rates of child poverty, schools can play a crucial role in improving social equity and labor market innovation. Food can serve as an anchor for action-based, intercultural and cross-class learning experiences, especially when street markets are employed as a means to encourage exchange. A unique opportunity exists to leverage the municipality's rich food culture, the historical urban fabric, intellectual and artistic professional culture and innovative school policies in order to open school grounds to the community. This project improves the well-being of children in the target districts and builds long-term skills through selforganized forms of learning.\nKey activities include: a. Organize a School Street Market Team to plan and advance a School Street Market Pilot Project b.

The Climate Change Mitigation Action Plan (CMAP) focuses on actions that aim at reducing energy consumption at the city level. The City of Athens has developed a GPC-compliant GHG emissions inventory, using 2014 as baseline year, through analyzing municipal, residential and commercial energy consumption. This also includes transportation, solid waste management and all related emissions. The greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 5,069,040 tons of CO2equivalent which is equal to 7.63t\/capita. The reduction target set is 40% reduction in GHG by 2030. Furthermore, the measures taken to mitigate climate change offer wider benefits to the city, such as financial (deriving from the reduction of energy costs) and social (deriving from job creation and protection of vulnerable population).\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport data-driven policy making\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance\nparticipation\n\u2022\tSupport transparency and accountability\n\u2022\tEnhance and promote communication channels with the\ncitizens\n\u2022\tPromote digital adaptation\n\u2022\tRaise awareness and appreciation for the City and its services\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tCombine essential services with dynamic urban development\n\u2022\tInvest in local capacity building\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tProtect and maintain critical infrastructure\n\u2022\tEnhance city's identity\n\u2022\tSupport and enhance natural environment\n\u2022\tPromote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owners: City of Athens (relevant depts. and ORS)\nPartners: C40, platform partners, universities and research centers\nLegislative authority:\nSDGs goals:\nFunding Sources: NSRF2014-2020, other EU funding,\nPPP\/ESCOs, Municipal funds\nTimeframe: Short-term (ongoing)\nE.1\nClimate change mitigation action plan\nuEn.1i.c1ipMal buildings and public lighting\na.\tThe City of Athens owns and is responsible for the maintenance of over 1000 buildings. Most of them have been constructed in the period 1960-1990\nand lack thermal insulation resulting in high energy demands. The City of Athens has implemented and will continue to implement energy retrofits and\nsoft energy-saving actions within its buildings to improve efficiency and reduce energy costs. The use of Renewable Energy Systems on buildings is also another important factor for reducing GHG emissions. (Action 6.1.1., CMAP)\nb.\tThe city is upgrading street lighting, replacing the existing 25-year-old network, with LED technology. Municipal street lighting network covers 930km in the city expanding over 3300 streets. It corresponds to 66% of the total annual municipal electric energy consumption. The number of luminaires is estimated at 45000. The City of Athens is currently conducting a photo-technical study on the street lighting.

The City of Athens will establish dedicated campaigns to raise citizens' environmental awareness, encouraging them to cut costs by reducing their energy consumption at home. Statistical studies have revealed that 85,9% of the thermal energy consumed is used for heating, while 67,3% of the electrical energy used is spent on household appliances. Educational campaigns in schools will continue through seminars\/workshops, leaflets, interactive communication focusing on children, their information and awareness regarding their carbon footprint. (Action 6.2.1., CMAP)\nb.\tSupport, promote and disseminate information regarding national energy saving programs. The program \u201cENERGY SAVING AT HOME\u201d initiated in 2011, has already improved the energy efficiency of 40.000 houses. The City of Athens will promote national funding programs regarding energy savings. Such programs can lead to significant energy efficiency in the residential sector, reach up to 44% of the final energy used. (Action 6.2.2., CMAP)\nc.\tIncrease the use of natural gas for heating demand in residential buildings. Currently diesel is the dominant choice of fuel used for heating demands in residential buildings. Assuming that 30% of Athenian building will be connected to the natural gas grid through the National Savings Programs mentioned above, the City of Athens-in cooperation with the natural gas suppliers - will implement awareness raising activities, aiming at steering the remaining households towards energy efficiency. Choosing natural gas over diesel for heating demands could save up to 20% in total energy consumption in the residential sector of Athens. (Action 6.2.3., CMAP)\nd.\tPromote nearly zero-energy buildings. The City of Athens will support in any possible way the conversion of 10% of the existing residential sector to nearly zero-energy-buildings until 2030. The City of Athens would like to become the point of reference for citizens seeking advice on this topic. (Action 6.2.4., CMAP)\nE.1\nClimate change mitigation action plan\ne.\tClimate Change Mitigation actions: a. increase green areas in low-green Athenian Districts, b. ameliorate local bioclimatic conditions through the use of cool materials, c. include shading elements throughout public areas. The above actions will have a significant effect in the reduction of airconditioning use as cooling devices during the hottest of months. (Action 6.2.5., CMAP)\nf.\tEstablish a municipal fund for energy upgrading of residential buildings. The City of Athens will establish a municipal fund that assists residents to implement energy upgrading of their buildings and cut costs. Its efforts will be based on the example of the \u201cProsopsi\u201d facades regeneration program that managed to renovate 4000 building facades in the first decade of the 21st century. If the City\nof Athens provides funds for energy upgrades to\n24.000 households until the year 2030, energy demands can be cut to 27% per residence. (Action 6.2.6., CMAP)\ng.\tAdvocate for the benefits of energy savings, targeting entrepreneurs. This measure addresses the tertiary sector. Up to 8.000 buildings have\nbeen recorded as hosting entrepreneurial activities in the City of Athens. The program \u201cBuilding the Future,\u201d running under the Ministry of Environment and Energy, aims at the reduction of energy\nconsumption in the tertiary sector. The City of Athens supporting this effort, will organize information campaigns on the benefits of energy savings, through ADDMA.

It is a policy framework that will allow Athens to look more successfully forward, taking into consideration the critical shocks and stresses, and make the best use of critical resources and services as the city transforms through time.\nOne of the main objectives of this endeavor has been to embed the logic and practices of resilience into the systems of the city. Engaging elected and the administrative staff in scenario-based exercises is one of the most effective way to inform and change mindsets around policy making. The Municipality will develop policymaking protocols, framed by different scenarios of what might happen to our city, based on forward-looking data collection and development.\nTogether with experts and the city administrators, we will start by considering different shocks and stresses scenarios, in order to prioritize, medium term actions of the strategy.

Metropolitan Governance means a clear division of responsibilities and jurisdictions between the different levels of government: Central government, through the ministries, Regional and Decentralized authorities and Local municipal government. The cross-juridical and overlapping authorities complexities make it often very hard to serve citizens. We need discrete functions and transparent relations. The objective is a unified management that organizes all the jurisdictions and functions relating to life in large cities and the needs of the citizens, in the most efficient and effective way using the principle of subsidiary.\nThe above is a long-term aim that involves years of advocacy and effort. In the short term however, the City of Athens will design and champion specific legislative reforms that are crucial for city's survival in the coming years. Those reforms address the challenging financial and social environment of Athens legislation, helping the city to adapt and be more flexible in times of challenge.\nThe legal department will issue a study for legislative proposals in order to ensure that the city can fully fulfill its functions. The key areas of focus:\n1.\tCreate the possibility of a municipal time-bank for exchanging\/bartering goods and services on the level of the city districts.\n2.\tRe-adjust the municipal taxation system in order to be able to provide specific incentives or disincentives to local entrepreneurs and Athenians in general.\n3.\tProvide the ability to develop a crowd sourcing and crowd funding system for supporting municipal projects and services.\n4.\tProvide a legal framework for spatial and temporal land use within city jurisdiction. This reform will permit temporary activities and interventions in vacant lots.\n5.\tProvide the right to municipalities to facilitate and provide digital access to labor coupons (ergosimo). The labor coupons will enable the City of Athens' periodical extra-work platform a measure that mitigates the black economy while allowing people to increase their wages.\n6.\tRe-adjust the legal framework regarding the sex workers and brothels licensing: Today in Athens none of the brothels are legal as the processes regarding their licensing are exorbitant and unrealistic which leaves\nall the sex workers in the city without social and health benefits.\n7.\tReal-Estate Property Taxation allocated to the Municipalities: This is a long standing proposal that will liberate from its economic dependency to the central government, linking its budget directly to the citizens that it serves.\n8.\tIssue kinder garden Permits for Home Day Cares: The limited capacity of municipal kinder gardens to cover the needs of the most vulnerable populations can be significantly supported by the creation of family day cares which today are not an option as there is no regulatory framework that can legitimize such activities.\n9.\tParticipatory Budgeting Regulatory Framework: Develop the ability for city districts to decide how to manage and distribute a specific percentage of the municipal budget.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tMitigate black economy in the city\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tSimplify bureaucratic processes\n\u2022\tChampion developmental instead of humanitarian approaches\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tPromote citizens' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owners: City of Athens (Legal department,\nMayor's Office)\nPartners: Athens Development and Destination\nManagement, Legal experts, universities\nLegislative authority:\nTime frame: Medium-term\nSDGs goals:\nA.4\nDetailed resilience studies\nDescription:\nIn the light of a potential shock and\/or chronic stresses such as climate change, the city should use data to assess and address its weaknesses and be prepared for prevention and protection. Athens has identified five areas that require detailed resilience studies. The following resilience related studies will be commissioned to universities or\/and other relevant researchers throughout public tender process:\na)\tA hydro-geological assessment of Athenian subsoil (underground streams, aquifer)\nb)\tA register of underground passages and tunnels using topographical surveying\nc)\tA traffic and transport study for the center of Athens,\nd)\tA study of Athenians' mobility patterns using geolocation of mobile phones (without impinging on issues of privacy)\ne)\tA critical networks food and fuel logistics study focusing on urban resilience (on the lines of \u201cwho feeds Athens\u201d and \u201cwho fuels Athens\u201d)\nThis action will be implemented with the collaboration of universities and research centers. These critical studies will allow foreseeing challenges before they occur and creating the basic knowledge that can support forward looking policies and actions.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthens municipal leadership\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tPromote citizens' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\n\u2022\tProtect and maintain critical infrastructure\n\u2022\tSupport data-driven policy making\nAction Owners: City of Athens\nPartners: universities, research centers, ADDMA, relevant municipal departments, public utility companies\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: Municipal funds Time frame: Short-term\nSDGs goals:\nGoal A\nEnhance planning in the face of serious challenges\nGoGaOAl LBE\nEmpower the municipal representatives\nand the local community\nAthens should create systems using innovative ways to empower both civil servants and the Athenians. New types of information and communication are needed. Both sides have to listen and speak in order to bridge gaps, foster trust and drGivOeAfLoBrward the city into the cGhOaAllLeCnging 21st century.\nWorkshops for promoting resilience\nConference for Athens\nThe city will organise a conference with municipal administrators and elected officials, representatives from the academic community as well as from the non-profit sector and the civil society in order to introduce the concept of the Municipal Neighborhood Network to key stakeholders and facilitate the best possible procedure and methodology for its creation.\nThe mistrust towards the public sector and the municipal administration and political authority has been defined as one of the major challenges for the resilience of Athens. The city recognizes that an efficient, interactive and transparent network can help evaluate the level of existing services as well collect and implement new projects identified by different stakeholders.\nDuring the Conference for Athens, the city district councils, the municipal departments and the political leadership will focus on specific resilient challenges of the city like the possible creation of a neighborhood watch program and the introduction of a feasible action plan for initiating a participatory budget in the municipality.\nB.1\nMunicipal neighborhood network\nDescription:\nA recurring challenge for the Municipality is the communication gap between the city and its residents. The city recognizes that an efficient, interactive and transparent network that spreads throughout the city can help evaluate the level of existing services as well collect and implement new projects identified by different stakeholders.\nCity of Athens aims to create an offline as well as online network that connect the political and administrative sector with the citizens at the neighborhood level. Athenians will be able to connect and interact with nodes of this network regarding their everyday life in the city. The goal is for the municipal authorities to help address the citizens daily challenges as well as to capitalize on the opportunities that different individuals and groups of people bringing to the city.\nThe proposed structure will be developed in the level of the seven city districts and their neighborhoods. The city will strive to find the best way to be present on the ground thought a political ambassador and city representatives.\nBuilding an efficient, interactive and transparent network can be a major catalyst for development, collection, evaluation and implementation of opportunities, efforts and offers of various stakeholders (from universities and institutions to private donors and citizens collectives).\nThe network should be closely linked with municipal networks\/projects like synAthina and Schools Open to the Neighborhood in order to maximize the impact to the city. Moreover, the role of the Office for Resilience and Sustainability, as a facilitator to this whole system can be significant here.\nCitizens that have been in contact with municipalities services the last 12 months\nYes, personally\nYes, other person at the same household\nYes, personally and other person at the same household\nNo, it has not happened\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tEnhance city's' identity\n\u2022\tRaise awareness and appreciation for the city and its services\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022\tPromote citizens' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tSupport transparency and accountability\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\nr-oPmote equitable,cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tPromote local culture\nAction Owners: City of Athens (ORS)\nPartners: platform partners, Deputy Mayor for Municipal Decentralization, Refugees and Migrants, city Municipal Districts, universities, Ministry of Interior, Office for Innovation, Urban Lab, Schools Open to the Neighborhood, synAthina, CSOs, NGOs\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: Municipal funds Time frame: Medium-term \/ aspirational\nSDGs goals:\nB.2\nMunicipal capacity building\nDescription:\nThe continuous recession and budget cuts as well as\na chronic lack of dependable data and the abounding\nbureaucratization of the public sector has created a climate of resentment and mistrust towards municipal employees and the city as a public. Moreover, the lack of transparency, absence of robust channels of communication, and\nineffective and without continuity implementation of public consultation has contribute to the general belief that local authority is insufficient, unqualified and ill-equipped and often corrupted.\nDuring the last few years, there have been steps made\ntowards opening the decision-making processes\nof the municipal authorities to the Athenians, some\nmore successful than others. Still, a vast majority of\nthe population believes that there is no participatory\ndecision making in Athens. The most crucial is the lack of communication between different parts of the municipality regarding activities and decisions as well as their\ncommunication to the districts and to the citizens.\nTo address this, the city will develop a capacity building\nprogram for participatory governance to be rolled out\nwithin the city administration and across city district\ncouncils. This action will be done in collaboration with a\nplatform partner and will focus on developing a toolkit\nto facilitate the management and dissemination of\ninformation between the city leadership, city district\ncouncils, and citizens.\nThe city will:\na.\tCreate a program to update the municipal skills in\nparticipatory decision-making. This will include holding\nseminars and workshops on the subject matter.\nb.\tLaunch Athens Municipality Serves, a series of virtual\nand in person platforms and actions aimed at changing\nhow public officials interact with residents, in an effort\nto earn the trust of residents and build confidence in\ngovernment and its services.\nc.\tUse the C40: Capacity Building for Carbon Disclosure,\na series of seminars building capacity among the\nadministration staff on greenhouse gas emissions data\ndevelopment and collection, as a model for a series of\ncapacity building for the administration around different\ncontemporary topics using local and international\nacademics, researchers and experts.\nd.\tUse the platform of life-long-learning for capacity\nbuilding on topics relevant to the interests and knowledge related to municipal services.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022 Support integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022 Raise awareness and appreciation for the city and its services\n\u2022 Promote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022 Develop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022 Enhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022 Support transparency and accountability\n\u2022 Enhance city's identity\n\u2022 Support and promote the human talent\nAction Owner: City of Athens ( ORS, Deputy Mayor for\nMunicipal Decentralization, Migrants and Refugees)\nPartners: TAPL, C40 Network, platform partners,\nAcademic Community, National Center for Public\nAdministration and local government, CSOs, Office for\ninnovation, research centers, private sector\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: Municipal funds, TAPL Time frame: Medium-term\nSDGs goals:\nEngage with our neighborhoods\nAn \"open city\" is a city that listens to its people. Athens has been trying to create structures of participatory governance, built on bottom-up informed policy making. This is what will make city governance more relevant, fair and trustworthy. Apart from the Districts that have to be supported and reinforced as administrative units, the sub-category of the Athenian neighborhood is still meaningful as a loose type of community and mode of belonging. The proposed action will emGpOoAwLeCr our neighborhood, fostering dialogue and participatory governance.\nLearning from Athens\nThe Schools open to the Neighborhood initiative is, in a small number of schools, coupled with Designed for Better Learning project. Through DBL project, a collaboration between the city, the University of Crete and the Niarchos Foundation, 11 school units in Athens were redesigned, in order a) to improve educational outcomes and b) to reclaim and prove the value of schools for community engagement by using participatory design technics and processes. DBL focuses on classrooms and common areas, including recreation spaces and teachers' lounges. The city will examine further funding possibilities to expand this imitative in a greater number of schools.\nC.1\nSchools open to the neighborhood\nDescription:\nThe city has recognized that there is an opportunity to use school buildings to host community events. This is a way of maximizing the use of buildings across the city and to help enhance community networks. The aim of the \u201cSchools Open to the Neighborhood\u201c initiative is to host crowdsourced by the neighborhood people activities, accessible to all Athenians, within school premises during after-school hours and weekends.\nSchool buildings become vibrant centers of activity for the community and students, teachers, parents, and residents are all invited to participate in education, cultural, athletic, and entertainment activities. The program also provides cleaning services and guards to monitor the area during the hours of operation. It includes maintenance works on participating schools such as graffiti removal, mending fences and installing safer, new court surfaces in schoolyards.\nTo date, over 2,554 Athens residents have signed up and currently 64 different activities are offered across the city.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022\tInvest in local capacity building\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian Neighborhood\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n\u2022\tSupport and enhance natural environment\n\u2022\tPromote citizens' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Children)\nPartners: Athens Partnership, Niarchos Foundation, University of Crete, NGOs, CSOs, synAthina\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: Athens Partnership, private donors,\nNSRF 2014-2020\nTime frame: Short-term\nSDGs goals:\nC.2\nMigration integration action plan\nDescription:\nIn the summer of 2015, Athens was faced with the shortterm challenge of finding temporary solutions in order to provide food, shelter and health care to large number of refugees arriving at or passing through the city. This was a tremendous challenge for the city, as it did not have any existing infrastructure to respond to the needs of the newcomers.\nTo help address the needs of the refugees the city immediately dedicated a space for the construction of the Elaionas camp. Elaionas, the first temporary accommodation center in the country, currently provides shelter to nearly 2.400 refugees. The city also appointed a Deputy Mayor responsible for the migrant and refugee agenda. Moreover, with the support of international partners and local NGO, the city was able to provide first reception services, but also to start planning for a housing program currently underway, subsidizing the rent of vacant apartments for the refugees.\nThe city's next goal is not only to provide first reception services to the population but also to draft and implement a holistic policy and action plan regarding the integration of migrants and refugees to the urban fabric. This plan should have a developmental approach and it should be based on the potential contribution and positive impact of the newcomers to Athens aiming at delivering solutions and achieving multiple benefits for all the residents. It will also take into consideration the output from the Athens Migration Exchange Network handbook.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthens municipal leadership\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022\tChampion developmental instead of humanitarian approaches\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote sustainable management and development\n-\tSupport data-driven policy making\n\u2022\tPromote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n-\tSupport transparency and accountability\n\u2022\tEnhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022\tMaximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Decentralization, Refugees and Migrants)\nPartners: Athens Migration Exchange Network, Deputy Mayor for Children, International Rescue Committee (IRC), Mercy Corps, local and international NGOs, BBC education programs, CSOs\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: Municipal funds, National Funds, private donors, International Rescue Committee (IRC)\nTime frame: Medium-term\nSDGs goals:\nC.2\nMigration integration action plan\nC.2.1 Continuation of relocation housing scheme\nThe Municipality of Athens, through the Athens Development and Destination Management Agency (ADDMA), is responsible for implementing an accommodation scheme to rent 200 apartments to refugees to refugees with relocation status, i.e. who can eventually leave Greece and relocate to other European counties. It makes provision for the accommodation of up to 6 beneficiaries (tenants) per apartment and alternation between beneficiaries. The scheme will eventually host up to 3.000 beneficiaries.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Decentralization, Refugees and Migrants)\nPartners: Athens Development and Destination Management Agency, UNHCR, Ministry of Migration\nand Refugees\nFunding sources: UNHCR, IRC, DG ECHO Time frame: Short-term\nC.2.2 Migration and refugee coordination center and observatory\nAthens has experienced a large influx of immigrants and refugees. This has meant that Athens has had to consider how best to integrate and provide basic services for refugees in the city. As part of this, the Municipality of Athens will set up a Migration and Refugee Coordination Center (MRCC) to prepare a refugee integration strategy. The MRCC will coordinate numerous city actors and will be responsible for managing the Municipality's daily activities which relate to helping refugees. This will consist of liaising with major programs such as the UN Refugee Agency's housing program, local stakeholders as well as other international organizations (e.g. Mercy Corps, International Rescue Committee) to provide emergency response services in case of a crisis.\nAdditionally, an Observatory for Refugees and Immigrants will be created, which will collect data on refugees to support and inform the activities and services offered by the MRCC. The data will be open to local and international stakeholders and will help inform policies and planning decisions related to migrants and refugees.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Decentralization, Refugees and Migrants)\nPartners: International Rescue Committee,\nMercycorps, local and international NGOs, universities\nFunding sources: Athens Partnership, private\ndonors, International donors, IRC\nTime frame: Short-term\nMigration integration action plan\nC.2.3 Community centers\nThe municipality plans to create with EU structural funds the following:\n\u2022\tTwo Community Centers, one stationary in the city center and one mobile that will be visiting the seven different municipal districts\n\u2022\tTwo Migration Integration Centers, one stationed in the city center and another one that will be mobile.\n\u2022\tA Center in the 4th district dedicated to the needs of the Roma populations.\nThese centers will be reception places providing support and information regarding all types of welfare services provided by the City of Athens.\nAll actions are related to social integration and supporting the subsistence level of the most marginalized populations. The Migration Integration Centres will be able to provide in addition supportive actions such as Greek language, history and culture lessons, intercultural activities for young people and children of local as well as refugee and immigrant populations, as well as activities that facilitate access to the job market.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Decentralization, Migration and Refugees)\nPartners: Deputy Mayor for Social Solidarity Welfare and Equality\nFunding sources: EU structural funds\nC.2.4 Activities aiming at immigrant population integration\nThe municipal initiative Schools Open to the Neighborhood was established in 2016 aiming to host activities, accessible to all Athenians, within school premises during after-school hours and weekends (separate description available below). While this initiative has already turned school building into vibrant centers of activity for the community and students, teachers, parents, and residents who participate in a host of educational, cultural, athletic, and entertainment activities, several of them already have managed to engage migrant populations. One of the most successful examples are the cooking lessons that engage women's networks that get together and cook recipes from all over the world. The afternoon activities of neighborhood people in open schools in every district are the perfect environment for integration initiatives.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Children and for Decentralization Migration and Refugees)\nPartners: universities, AMEN, CSOs, Deputy Mayor for Child, Schools Open to the Neighborhood, Local and international NGOs\nFunding sources: Municipal funds, structural funds, private donors\nTime frame: Short-term\nTime frame: Short-term\nAthens will nurture and develop its\nassets in order to promote wellbeing, creativity, entrepreneurship and a new, inclusive, and exciting identity.\ntAh.e1 ns IDA\nrAe.a2tive eCconomy strategic plan\noAl.i3stic ciHty brand\nrAe.e4n andG cultural urban corridors\nuAs.t5ainabSle municipal real-estate management\niAty.6centecr development project\naBc.1a. nt buVildings: crucial urban resource Bm.p2loymEent action framework oBc.3ial hoSusing program lBd.4train sOtations refurbishment xBp.5ropriaEtion and greening of abandoned lots in\nAthens\nGoal A\nEnhance the city's identity and promote new types of belonging\nThe City of Athens needs a positive identity.

Thanks to cutting-edge technology and highly specialized staff - from\nmultimedia editors to branding experts - Athens' cultural entrepreneurs are forging new growth areas in Greece's 21st century economy.\nThe creative economy is especially vibrant in Athens, however the lack of strategic planning and a complex bureaucracy prevents the rise of the industry. The city will draft a plan focusing on supporting creative industry and on upgrading the role of the city through the creation of a friendly entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nThe improvement of a regulatory framework in\ncombination with a holistic developmental approach that attracts capital investment will boost the quality of goods and services as well as improve the global position of Athens as a creative capital. The actions to be implemented are: formation of an Advisory Board as the overseeing body; commission an economic and fiscal impact analysis; draft a strategic action plan and start with most implementable interventions.\nThe mandate of the Advisory Board will be to investigate the connections between the informal and formal sectors as crucial for informed creative economy policy development support the creative industry at the local level and provide incentives to creative businesses located in the seven city districts. The aim is to boost the Athenian creative class by fostering creative clusters, encouraging use of empty buildings as creative hubs, supporting the creation of business incubators, accelerators and networks, and organizing special events across the city.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022\tSupport data-driven policy making\n\u2022\tEnhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022\tSupport transparency and accountability\n\u2022\tPromote digital adaptation\n\u2022\tDevelop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022\tSupport integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022\tRaise awareness and appreciation for the city and its services\n\u2022\tInvest in local capacity building\n\u2022\tPromote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022\tEnhance city's identity\n\u2022\tPromote local culture\n\u2022\tProvide incentives for economic development\n\u2022\tPromote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022\tMaximize urban assets\nAction Owner: City of Athens\nPartners: universities, Research Centres, Athens Development and Destination Management Agency, Athens Culture Net, Major cultural institutions, Ministry of Development and Ministry of Labour and Social Wealthy, Ministry of Culture, British Council\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: Municipal funds, structural funds, NSRF 2014-2020\nTime frame: Medium-term\nSDGs goals:\nA.2\nCreative economy\nstrategic plan\nA.2.1 Creative economy advisory board\nAthens will establish a Creative Economy Advisory Board to identify and propose an integrated city approach towards policy-making that will ensure a thriving creative industry for the coming years.

The concept of temporary usage presents a set of solutions, inspired by other cities around the world while integrating a whole set of local urban dynamics that are creating today the right environment for co-creation, collective commitment and community engagement.\nAthens will create a framework of actions of creative uses of unused spaces cultivating the methodologies and the best practices shared in\ninternational networks and partnerships with cities\nwithin and outside Greece.\na.\tAssess and implement the forthcoming URBACT action plan \"Refill\" focusing on creating an action\nplan with proposed solutions on the temporary use of empty spaces.\nb.\tInvestigate the multiple studies that populated the Franziska Orzo Project (2016) regarding incomplete construction of buildings and facilities\nleft gaping in Metaxourgio and the Kerameikos area.\nc.\tExamine the implementation possibilities of\nthe Vienna project or Project Urbanaughts and Gratzelhotel (Neighborhood Hotel) for Athens\ntogether with investment possibilities.\nAction Owner: City of Athens\nPartners: city of Vienna, Athens Development and Destination Management Agency, Refill URBACT\nprogram\nFunding sources: private Investors, Crowdsourcing Time frame: Medium-term \/ aspirational\nEmployment action framework\nDescription:\nAfter six whole years of economic crisis the levels of\nunemployment in Greece are the highest in the Eurozone: 23,3% in the general population and 44,2% among young people (January 2017: Eurostat)\nThe City of Athens, except from the Municipal\nEmployment Agency allowed by the local authority\nlegislative framework (Kalikratis), doesn't have other\nauthorities regarding employment and job creation.\nHowever, through its two developments agency's the\nAthens Destination and Development Management\nAgency and the Technopolis City of Athens, the City\nof Athens in the years of economic crises, through\ncollaborations with all the city's Professionals Associations and major partners from the IT sector, managed to establish several Business Start-up Incubators and Accelerators. The most famous of which INNOVATHENS located in Technopolis City of Athens.\nEven though it does not fall under its precise jurisdiction, authority and scope, the City of Athens, through partnerships, innovative thinking and legislative amendments is ready to develop and launch a series of equal opportunity initiatives that will help employment and the development of SMEs.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022 Support data-driven policy making\n\u2022 Enhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022 Develop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022 Support integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022 Raise awareness and appreciation for the city and its services\n\u2022 Maximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022 Mitigate black economy in the city\n\u2022 Combine essential services with dynamic urban development\n\u2022 Invest in local capacity building\n\u2022 Promote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022 Enhance city's identity\n\u2022 Promote local culture\n\u2022 Support and promote the human talent\n\u2022 Provide incentives for economic development\n\u2022 Promote sustainable management and development\n\u2022 Promote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022 Maximize urban assets\nAction Owner: City of Athens\nPartners: Athens Development and Destination\nManagement Agency, TAPL, Technopolis City of Athens, Academic Community\/Athenian universities, Civil Society Organizations, Professionals Associations, Ministry of\nLabour, Ministry of Development\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: the Bertelsmann Foundation, Central\nGovernment, Municipal, structural funds and private funds Time frame: Short-term to Long-term\nSDGs goals:\nEmployment action framework\nB.2.1 Platform for extra work\nThis is a policy proposal that was developed in the context of the Transatlantic Policy Lab (TAPL), an initiative instituted in Boston and Athens by 100RC Platform Partner, the Bertelsmann Foundation. The proposal aims at making the local labor market more efficient by enabling people to connect and identify informal employment opportunities.\nThe Platform for Extra Work centers on how the municipality can make the local labor market more efficient by setting up a digital platform in which Athenians can seek informal employment. This initiative combats the black market, increasing individual income and contributing to GDP growth. Through this initiative the city will assess and qualify available demand, engage funders, and keep the market for extra work (which is largely a black market) under local control and supplied with bookings.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (ADDMA, ORS)\nFunding sources: the Bertelsmann Foundation and Municipal funds\nTime frame: Short-term to Medium - term\nB.2.2 Work integration social enterprises\nAfter 6 years of economic crisis with high levels of unemployment among locals and refugees unable to leave the country the City of Athens needs to find ways to help integrate people into the workforce. This is important for the city's systems and structures, as Athens is actually emptying out, losing its population as many businesses have close and many houses are empty. In addition city staff is shrinking and the city doesn't have the ability to hire more employees.\nThe municipal social services department launched in 2016 a pilot program linking social welfare beneficiaries to social entrepreneurship. The pilot program included 20 beneficiaries. Based on that experience the city should scale it up and institute a whole series of Work Integration Social Enterprises based on the example of similar programs in Europe.\nThe following steps of the pilot program should be scaled up and enhanced by the experience of other cities\/countries that have proposed and implemented policies that repositioned thousands of disadvantaged persons from conventional welfare structures in which they were simple objects of assistance, to full re-integration in society. That is transforming them into producers and generators of value for themselves and for others.\na.\tProvide training for Social Services' Employees implementing the methodology developed by the ADDMA's program for social entrepreneurship\nb.\tLink beneficiaries from vulnerable populations with to social entrepreneurs\nc.\tMonitor the beneficiaries' progress\nd.\tDevelop a robust methodology for the integration of socially vulnerable groups to social enterprises\ne.\tDevelop a micro-loan scheme\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Municipal Social Service Department, ADDMA)\nPartners: universities\nFunding sources: Municipal and Athens Partnership funding\nTime frame: Short-term to Medium - term\nEmployment action framework\nB.2.3 Refugee and immigrant business permits\nEncourage the entrepreneurial efforts of refugees and immigrants who have work permits by facilitating the municipal process of issuing SMEs' permits.

My Athens is centered on providing a learning environment within a \u201cminiature town,\u201d where students spend a day as employees, citizens and consumers, with the support of teachers, facilitators and public and private organizations. With the award-winning educational initiative Me and Mycity,12 pioneered in Finland, as a blueprint, Athens should launch an initiative in the 6th district aimed at enhancing basic education to drive entrepreneurship, economic development and social cohesion. Pilot the My Athens Project will allow the municipality to tackle demotivation and a lack of civic knowledge among students aged 11-13. MyAthens will build on existing initiatives in the municipality and the 6th district, such as the Schools Open to the Neighborhood.\nAction Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for Children, ORS)\nPartners: School Teachers\/Administrators,\nStudents, District Council, Schools Open to the Neighbourhood, Business Community, NGOs, universities and the Office of Innovation\nFunding sources: TAPL\nTime frame: Short-term to Medium - term\nFunding sources: Ministry of Education\nTime frame: Short-term to Medium - term\nSocial housing program\nDescription:\nThe continuous economic recession has left a significant percentage of the population facing the risk of homelessness as they cannot afford rent, taxes and loan payments. Therefore, the provision of an equitable, fair and sustainable module for social housing constitutes a crucial need for Athens. Even though it doesn't fall within the limits of its jurisdiction the municipal social services have already established several such building to accommodate a small part of the marginalized population needs.\nIt is a resilient knowledge that achievements can only be gained through balanced and thoughtful development plans measuring the geographical urban and human\nresources.\nThe city in collaboration with the central government\nshould create a program to provide social housing\nin empty buildings of Athens in a diverse group of\nvulnerable populations and beneficiaries. The system\nshould be based in a strict and fair model of evaluation of the beneficiaries based on meritocracy in order to justify the selection of the people and the implementation of the project.\nResilience Value:\n\u2022 Enhance and promote communication channels with the citizens\n\u2022 Support transparency and accountability\n\u2022 Develop synergies with city stakeholders and enhance participation\n\u2022 Support integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership\n\u2022 Raise awareness and appreciation for the city and its services\n\u2022 Maximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood\n\u2022 Mitigate black economy in the city\n\u2022 Combine essential services with dynamic urban development\n\u2022 Invest in local capacity building\n\u2022 Promote equitable, cohesive and supportive communities\n\u2022 Enhance city's identity\n\u2022 Promote local culture\n\u2022 Support and promote the human talent\n\u2022 Champion developmental instead of humanitarian approaches\n\u2022 Provide incentives for economic development\n\u2022 Promote sustainable management and development\n\u2022 Promote residents' well-being and ameliorate their quality of life\n\u2022 Maximize urban assets\nAction Owner: City of Athens, central government\nPartners: Academic Community, Deputy Minister of\nLabor, Social Solidarity and Social Welfare, Ministry\nof Development, Ministry of Energy and Environment,\nRegion of Attica\nLegislative authority:\nFunding sources: UNHR, National and structural funds, Municipal funds\nTime frame: Long-term \/ aspirational\nSDGs goals:\nSocial housing program\nB.3.1 Relocation program expansion for vulnerable populations\nA program will be created to provide social housing taking advantage of the empty buildings of Athens and linking them with the diverse group of vulnerable populations.

As a part of this action, the Resilient Athens team will reach out to the fellow cities in order to identify open data ecosystems that facilitate stake-holder's interaction with city data.\n#3 - Bristol city 2066 Net-Zero Homes | Bristol\nMost global governments are successfully delivering against their carbon emissions reduction targets. It is widely thought that climate change has been successfully contained to within 1.5 degrees. A Well-Being Index is used in political decision making in Bristol and many other devolved areas of the UK. The Circular city initiative, adopted by several UK cities, has led to a step-change increase in resource efficiency. Bath has been recognized for its excellence in resource hyper-efficiency and has become a leading example globally. Urban hubs such as Southmead, Hengrove and Thornbury have become increasingly restructured around localized services that support and promote zero waste.\nProducers are required by international law to design goods for disassembly and reuse globally. There has been an accelerated effort to construct net-zero homes in Bristol's rural areas and on brown-field sites, and a marked increase in regional food production in recent years. North Somerset has pioneered quality green housing in the UK. Smart metering is used across all domestic and commercial asset types, helping manage demand for energy and water. Over 500,000 new jobs have been generated as a result of the Vision for Sustainable Growth.\n#4 - Municipal Capacity Building | Oakland\nThe 100RC city of Oakland (California) is developing alongside with Platform Partner, Rebuild by Design a collaborative process alongside with the city staff and community leaders to conduct more effective engagement in person and online, identify opportunities and practices to include the community in the decisionmaking process and establish applicable frameworks for discrete issues that can be iterated and replicated. The Resilient Athens Team will collaborate with the city and its Chief Resilience Officer to share information about successful projects and lessons learn.\n#5 Employment Action Framework | Oakland\nThe city of Oakland (California) has partnered with the non-profit micro-finance company Kiva and other key actors to offer zero percent interest loans for small business entrepreneurs. The crowd-funded program\nmatches trustees with a diverse range of borrowers supporting entrepreneurs in low-income neighborhoods. As we are investigating equitable investment processes, we will collaborate with the city and its Chief Resilient Officer to examine this initiative and share approaches and lessons learn.\n#6 - Creative Economy Strategic Plan | Several Cities\nSeveral 100RC cities are focusing on developing holistic plan that will enhance diversified economy and foster creative industries. Despite our different histories and geographies, we can all work together to find contemporary solutions to address the global financial challenge and create a productive future for our citizens. Cities currently involved are Semarang, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.\n#7 - Social housing | Several Cities\nSeveral 100RC cities, including London (United Kingdom), Oakland (California, USA), Bristol (United Kingdom) and\nVancouver (Canada), are facing the critical challenge of providing affordable and suitable housing -a United Nations-recognized basic human right. As part of this action, the Resilient Athens Team will collaborate with cities and their Chief Resilience Officer to share approaches and information.\n#8 Sustainable Mobility Action Plan | Several Cities\nSeveral cities working to offer sustainable alternatives to car drivers. From Lyft to Uber, tech companies are providing a broad range of answers to urban commuting. The Resilient Athens Team will collaborate with San Francisco and other 100RC cities in order to identify the most resilient solutions to the challenge of urban mobility. #9 - Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan\nIn November 2016, 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) and C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) announced their partnership to leverage resources and facilitate cooperation between the two groups, along with member cities to ensure for robust climate change and resilience plans. The Athens Climate Adaptation Plan is a result of the collaboration between two of the world's leading urban networks and policy organizations. 39 cities are currently participating in both networks.\n#10 - Goal B - Proactive Pillar | Thessalomki\nThessalorn'ki the other Greek city in the 100RC network is currently developing actions to upscale the role of boroughs to the development and progress of their districts. The city is proposing a set of pilot projects that will introduce new methods of civic engagement, decentralize power and improve trust and engagement between local authorities and citizens. As we are growing in a common legal and regulatory environment, Resilient Athens team will collaborate with the city and its Chief Resilience Officer to share information about successful projects and lessons learn.\n#11 Auckland's Waste to Resources project has put the city on track to achieve zero waste by 2040 | Auckland\nIn efforts to achieve zero waste by 2040, Auckland initiated the Waste to Resources project in 2012, diverting materials from the waste stream and improving resource efficiency throughout the city. As one of the biggest changes in waste management in the Southern Hemisphere, seven regional services were folded into one improved city-wide waste management system. The city aims to have new services rolled out progressively by 2020, such as a network of community-led resource recovery centers, a third bin collection for food waste, and a new inorganic waste service that diverts useful material to community organizations.\n#12 Renewable Energy Cooperatives | New York\nBright Power's Resilient Power Hub is a small-scale power plant that provides buildings with instantaneous backup power to critical systems when the grid goes down, as well as energy savings the rest of the time. It can operate as part of or independent from the utility grid. The 100RC city of New York is currently implementing the micro grids and micro grid networks solutions to local businesses.\nThe Resilient Athens Team will reach to the city in order to identify the best possible approaches for Athens.\n#13 Communication Campaigns | Barcelona\nAs part of its long-term strategy to improve relations between new immigrants and native residents, the Barcelona city Council launched an innovative public campaign to dispel rumors, misconceptions, and prejudices that local people have about minorities and newcomers. Modeled on successful campaigns that made drinking and driving, and smoking, urgent public issues, the initiative includes a series of videos that satirize various stereotypes, such as losing cultural identity because of immigrants.\n#14 Waste Management | Amman\nThe sharp rise in the population in and around Amman (mostly due to recent influxes of Syrian refugees) has led to a 25% increase in the levels of waste generation.\nTo meet this challenge, the city is developing a comprehensive program to reform the solid waste sector that will lead to the generation of renewable energy, reduction of CO2 emissions, and creation of new jobs. Besides developing and implementing a waste management framework, the city will establish waste to energy facilities and other pilot projects.\n#15 Sustainable Mobility Roadmap | Bangkok\nThe sharp rise in the population in and around Amman (mostly due to recent influxes of Syrian refugees) has led to a 25% increase in the levels of waste generation.\nTo meet this challenge, the city is developing a comprehensive program to reform the solid waste sector that will lead to the generation of renewable energy, reduction of CO2 emissions, and creation of new jobs. Besides developing and implementing a waste management framework, the city will establish waste to energy facilities and other pilot projects.\nWorking with our partners\nTransAtlantic Policy Lab | Proposals for an equitable and resilient Athens\nThe Bertelsmann Foundation, with generous support from the Open Society Foundations, partnered with the 100 Resilient Cities (pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation) and the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) to launch the Transatlantic Policy Lab (TAPL).\nOne American city (Boston) and one European city (Athens) have been selected to serve as pilot partners for assessment, analysis and policy implementation. TAPL convened a diverse group of American and European policymakers, practitioners and thought leaders to pursue innovative approaches to address the issue of social inequity. The group charged with identifying and designing customized policy solutions for implementation in each pilot city.\nThe Athens Lab was designed to build on the key findings of the Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA), which used community engagement to rank and order the municipality's resilience priorities. The recommendations contained finally fed into the Athens' Resilience Strategy.\nA week-long explorations by a team of trans-Atlantic experts from local government, nongovernmental organizations and the private sector, took place at Athens on June 2016. It composed of eight American and eight European policy experts drawn from a range of backgrounds. The 16 participants divided into two teams, each accompanied by one local expert from the city. Each team of experts focused on one of two neighborhoods within the city those of Victoria Square and Avdi Square. In order to identify the specific drivers of social inequity at work in Athens, lab experts from the perspective social equity and inclusive growth focused on two topics, which were job creation, employment and entrepreneurship and place making aiming at reviving public space for residents and businesses in each neighborhood.\nThe Athens Lab was an intensive, on-the-ground exercise designed to produce targeted and implementable recommendations based on community input. The Athens Lab's findings constitute a recommendation memo for the City of Athens that outlines and includes specific proposals for improving social equity and economic opportunity in the two focus municipality districts, and a review of best practices (policies and programs). The lab produced the following recommendations as a result of its collaboration and engagement with City of Athens and local stakeholders in the three thematic areas: trust and accountability, economy and place making.\nThe trust and accountability group has proposed recommendations to support a more functional, livable and inclusive municipality that enhances well-being and opportunity so that all Athenians have the chance to thrive. This group proposes a municipal initiative to change the culture of how government serves citizens, be more transparent and accountable and galvanize residents to work toward making Athens a more functional, livable, inclusive and resilient city.\nThe economy group has developed its recommendations to boost resilience through initiatives to support trust,\neducation, health and employment. At the city level, the lab recommends enhancing economic opportunity by supporting individual access to legitimate periodical opportunities and leveraging Athens' comparative advantage in the medical tourism sector. At the neighborhood level, the lab recommends strategies to engage youth and develop anchor institution-community relations.\nThe place making group focused on developing context-specific place making tactics to enhance social equity in Athens. Public space can play a crucial role in this process, serving as a crossroads for people, place and policies. Public space is where citizens exchange their views and the municipality's collective culture, politics, economy and ecology come together. The City of Athens should undertake a sustained effort to activate participation, citizens' views, knowledge and practices through public space. The recommendations put forth by the place making group are divided into three tiers. These tiers align with opportunities for short-term action, longterm action and pilot projects aimed at spurring further projects and activities in both the short and long term.\nThe TAPL recommendations were presented to the Mayor and to the Deputy Mayors as well the Athens Resilience Steering Committee and a series of other stakeholders. Several of them are integrated into the Athens Resilient Strategy and they have influenced the strategy and the overall resilience process in a profound and holistic way.\nAthens Network Exchange: Global Migration Resilient Cities at the Forefront\nThis Opportunity Report offers relevant approaches and examples of how to use data for better decision-making, as well as to better inform and engage residents.\nMass migration has grown into one of the major urban challenges of the 21st Century. As cities contend with the effects of climate change and aging infrastructure, they must also learn to adapt to waves of newcomers. Today, more than 60 million people have had to leave their homes because of conflict, in the largest wave of human displacement since World War II. Yet even this number is dwarfed by the world's total population of international migrants, which peaked at 244 million in 2015. Regardless of their reasons for arrival, the overwhelming majority of migrants now remain in cities, and are helping shape their future. Like other urban pressures, migration also presents a powerful opportunity for building resilience.\nIn September of 2016, eight 100RC member cities, with a broad range of experience absorbing migrants, convened in Athens to collaborate on migration as a key component of urban planning. Chief Resilience Officers (CROs) from Athens, Thessaloni'ki, Amman, Paris, Montreal, Los Angeles, Ramallah, and Medellin, shared what they have encountered, their successes and failures, and worked together to put forward practical solutions. The cities also had the additional expertise of partners such as the International Rescue Committee, MasterCard, Esri, the International Organization of Migration, Welcoming America, the Brookings Institution, Mercy Corps, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nAgainst the backdrop of the refugee crisis, Exchange participants seized the opportunity to make migration central to the urban agenda. Athens' experience presented a poignant illustration of the need to prioritize solutions that provide multiple benefits through single interventions in both times of crisis and times of calm Global Migration: Resilient Cities at the Forefront reflects the exchange's clear-eyed appraisal of the urban challenges of migration and the participants' collective work to address and find opportunity in them. Organized\ninto four approaches, the document highlights best practices and pressing challenges, and concludes by emphasizing the need for cities to develop better local, national, and international partnerships to successfully integrate newcomers and build resilience that makes cities better for all residents.\nAs mass migration challenges our cities in unprecedented ways, we must continue to build a foundation for incorporation into our visions for a resilient future. Through this hand-book, and the collaboration it reflects, we can build on the important work of moving beyond the sudden shocks of migration towards the possibilities it brings. We stand at a critical crossroads, where the actions we take now will impact the future of all our residents and generations to come. We have the responsibility to work together to recognize and adapt to an unpredictable future, and to remain committed to the equitable adaptation and transformation of our cities.\n\u201cThe numbers and statistics found in the Global Migration: Resilient Cities at the Forefront handbook attest for the crucial role that migration and refugee flows are and will probably be one of the main challenges that our city is and will face. As a result of the Athens Network Exchange and the discussion between the participating cities and experts what became evident was the need to move away from the perspective that sees this challenge as a humanitarian crisis that different countries and international organizations have to deal with.\nA resilient approach sees the influx of populations as an opportunity for urban center development. For those who will choose to stay in our country, it becomes a challenge for us to integrate them into our society in the best possible manner, helping the revival of our economy in the city's neighborhoods. The newcomers can become a source of enrichment in the modern multi-ethnic and multicultural urban environment of our city.\u201d\nEleni Myrivili, Athens CRO.\nWaste Management and Cleaning Services\nA) Municipal waste collection and public realm cleansing strategy\nThe objective of the strategy is to perform a gap analysis between the existing municipal waste collection and public realm cleansing arrangements and the objectives that Athens Municipality aims to achieve in order to improve the resilience and the overall standards of their waste management system. 100 Resilient Cities, ARUP and the City of Athens collaborated for this strategy.\nThe strategy concluded in a long list of recommendations categorized as:\n1.\tAdministrative Recommendations\n2.\tOperational recommendations\n3.\tMarkets\n4.\tThe Commercial Triangle\n5.\tStreet cleansing\nB) Problem Framing Workshop for \u201cWaste Management and Cleaning Services\u201d\nAthens Resilience and Sustainability Office in\ncollaboration with 100RC and citymart, organized the Problem Framing Workshop on Waste Management\nand cleaning services. The result of this workshop is concluded in 3 reports.\nReport #1: Building a culture of responsibility and awareness towards waste management\nThis Opportunity Report offers relevant approaches and examples of policies and methods for effective waste separation, educational programs, awareness and communication campaigns, as well as programs and incentives to increase compost and recycle levels.\nReport #2: Enhancement of waste management infrastructure and equipment\nThis Opportunity Report offers relevant approaches and examples of new tools and equipment in the field that make it easier and more efficient for residents to sort and store their garbage\/recycle and for city waste workers to pick up and transfer waste through the city as well as for the city to do something with the waste it collects. This includes recycling facilities, municipal infrastructure for proper waste management, smart waste solutions and modern waste treatment infrastructures.\nReport #3: Using data for better decision-making in waste management and better engagement with residents\nStakeholder roles and implementation\nResilient Athens: an inclusive and participatory process Stakeholder roles and implementation\nCore value of the resilience model is participation.\nAthens, like the other 99 Resilient Cities, introduced the\nconcepts and methods of the 100 Resilient Cities program by convening an Agenda Setting Workshop (with 130 Athenians). February 2016, the city started its resiliencebuilding journey by drafting a robust Stakeholder\nEngagement Plan.\nA year and a half later, Athens is bestowed with this\ndocument created in collaboration with city officers\nand elected officials, central government authorities,\nacademics, nonprofits, , entrepreneurs, and a large\nvariety of citizens and community groups. More than\n140 organizations and 900 citizens participated in 40\nworkshops, conferences or public events. Athens initiated and co-hosted international meetings with fellow cities; international and local experts worked together trying to get a better grasp of the challenges the city is facing as they searched for resilient solutions.\nBeyond the main three international collaborations\naround the themes of Migration, Climate Change and\nSocial Equity, we also co-organized along with other\nmunicipalities, central government representatives, NGOs and the Heinrich Bell Foundation two large multiple day conferences on Municipal Energy Savings and Energy\nPoverty with about 200 participants. We also co-\norganized with Symbiosis - Center for Political Studies of the Council of Europe, a two-day workshop on Open Data and local government with 100 participants including\nadministrators from four other municipalities, relevant\nministries and public utility companies.\nWe also organized four cross-sectoral and cross-\njurisdictional working groups of more than 100 people and several smaller workshops aiming breaking municipal and cross level administrative silos. The topics covered heat\nwaves and the urban heat island effects, greening the city, Athens assets and risks, women entrepreneurs, migration and integration, best practices for social cohesion and\ncoexistence, city branding and public-private sector\ncollaborations, urban planning and sustainable mobility.\nIn February 2017, 30 city officers and 30 citizens\nparticipated in a Problem-Framing Workshop, organized by our platform partner citymart, aiming at identifying the challenges and providing realistic solutions to waste management and city cleaning.\nAlmost all of our municipal departments and agencies\nparticipated in meetings and discussions as well as\nworkshops and conferences and provided key input\nregarding the everyday management of the city and the\ncurrent legislative and regulatory framework of Greek\nlocal authorities.\nThe Resilience Steering Committee (RSC) played a crucial role as the overseeing body of the Athens Resilient Team. The RSC is an interdisciplinary cohort of high-level stakeholders from different governmental, academic and nonprofit institutions and areas of expertise. The committee comprises of 18 members and is led by the Mayor of Athens. The key objective is to provide interdisciplinary input and guidance on the content of the Athens resilience strategy on its development and integration into municipal operations, funding and implementation. The RSC met four times during the first year of the Athens Resilient Team' operation and provided valuable input and inspiration in the formation of the Athens Resilient Strategy.\nWhat comes next?\nThe Athens Resilience Strategy is the result of the invaluable investment of many busy people's time, insight and inspiration generously provided in the context of many discussions, brainstorming sessions, structured workshops and research. From university students to deputy mayors, from migrant women to the members of the seven city district councils and from international experts to Athens-based architects and planners, the resilience dialogue reach out to many relevant stakeholders, aiming at investigating as many as possible opportunities for a holistic, long-term and realistic resilience building plan for the city made out of robust, concrete and implementable actions.\nThe shared and collaborative process will continue during the next phase of the strategy. Following the release of the strategy, we will start developing an implementation plan with the different municipal departments and city partners, to identify the priority actions for implementation in the short term By championing the strategy, city stakeholders, will forge the links between the Strategy and the city. By continuing full-heatedly\nthe engagement with different stakeholders, with new working groups and the Resilience Steering Committee, we will proliferate and enhance the relations created during the first year of Resilient Athens.\nWe invite you to be part of the effort. We invite you to identify actions you would like to be involved in let us know of practices that you think are already contributing to our resilience goals. We are constantly looking for new partners, new ways of working and new ways to finance and find new resources for our city's resilience building actions.\nVisit: resilientathens.wordpress.com\nEmail: resilient.athens@gmail.com\nFollow: Resilient Athens\n#ResilientAthens\nMonitoring and evaluation plan\nOffice of Resilience and Sustainability\nSince December 2016, the new organizational chart and\nmanagement structure of the City of Athens is in effect\naccording to the governmental official gazette No 3812\/\nB'\/28-11-2016. This management structure establishes, for the first time in the city, the Resilience and Sustainability Office (ORS) under the Mayor's office.\nDuring the drafting of this document, ORS is funded by\n100RC while there are great efforts to participate in EU\nfunded projects through collaboration with organization across Europe in the framework of large consortium.\nImplementation\nORS team is currently working for over 1 year in the\ndevelopment of the Resilience Strategy. Through this\nexciting and resourceful work, the ORS has established\nits role in the city and the top management is in close\ncollaboration with the Resilient Athens team. In this\nframework, the ORS has already undertaken the\nimplementation of specific actions that are of high\nimportance for the Mayor. In this context, the Resilient\nAthens team will undertake the implementation of\nspecific action that will be appointed during phase III and in collaboration with the city stakeholders such as deputy mayors, municipal development companies, etc, will coimplement other actions or provide assistance of any kind to the project management teams of these actions.\nMore specifically, the ORS will:\n\u2022 establish an Internal Monitoring Team to oversee the implementation of the Resilience Strategy\n\u2022 prepare Phase III: Implementation with 100RC. Available tools and services for implementation of Strategic Actions\n\u2022 organize meetings with the relevant Deputy Mayors in order to select and prioritize implementable actions for the upcoming 2 years\n\u2022 launch a workshop with relevant municipal administrators to present the Resilience Strategy and set up specific targets and budgets\nMonitoring\nThe main objective of the office is to ensure that the\napproved Resilience Strategy and its actions will be\nproperly developed, implemented, monitored and\nreported. Additionally, ORS will closely collaborate\nwith the vice mayors, municipal districts councils and\nother stakeholders inside and outside the municipal\nauthority, in order to, promote and mature the resilience\nactions. The biggest challenge for the ORS, following its\nestablishment, is to ensure its continuity throughout the\ndifferent political leaderships and establish an office with high level experts and knowledge that will ensure the high level implementation of the Resilience Strategy.\nORS will monitor the implementation and the impact of\nthe actions using the monitor indicators for each action\n(see Appendix) specifically developed for this reason,\nwhile monitor the impact on the SDG goals as they have\nbeen allocated in each action. The monitoring indicators that will monitor the SDGs are being drafted by the General Secretariat of the Hellenic Republic. Moreover, monitoring indicators and KPIs from the Sustainable Urban Development Plan, Integrated Territorial\nInvestments Actions the Integrated Urban Development\nPlan will be assigned to each action as per the indicators specifically developed in the framework of these Plans.\nEvaluation\nEach action of the Resilience Strategy will be monitored\nthrough the establishment of performance indicators.\nThe evaluation of the actions will be the result of\nthe measurement and assessment of the monitoring\nindicators. Evaluating actions, changing them if necessary, and being open about what has and has not worked, will be a significant benefit of Resilient Athens, both locally and across the 100RC network. Each action will have each progress and evaluation report which will be updated\nfrequently. The evaluation will contain corrective action\nplans and suggestions on how to overcome specific\nbarriers.","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["European

Looking back 13 years, we\nwere celebrating the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece, only few years from\nthe economic and political crisis. Significant changes can happen in 13 years\nand our city has survived many of those over the centuries.\nThessaloniki used to be an important crossroad of cultures and populations,\na melting pot of various religions and ethnicities that managed to coexist\nsmoothly and positively. This embedded complexity is reflected in the present cultural richness of the city, the pride and unique identity of the people.\nOur administration was the first, after many years of introversion, to open up\nthe city again to the world. Since 2011, we doubled the number of international visitors in Thessaloniki, we created a safety net for the most vulnerable, we provided communities with spaces for expression and action, whilst implementing robust internal administration and financial reform.\nNow is time to maximize our efforts further, to ensure a legacy for future\ngenerations and together, create a new roadmap for the ongoing development of the city. Our participation in the \u201c100 Resilient Cities\u201d network is an opportunity to be part of a global community of cities and people, and to develop a holistic strategy for the future of Thessaloniki.\nHow do we want Thessaloniki to be in 2030? What are the challenges today\nand tomorrow? What should the focus of our work be over the next years?\n\u2022 Designing and providing mobility that serves our citizens\n\u2022 Developing an urban economy agenda that invests in the human talent of the city and supports local economic clusters such as tourism, creative economy, and historic central markets\n\u2022 Making the city welcoming to new residents, especially those coming from countries affected by war\n\u2022 Co-creating and activating public spaces and re-discovering the city's relationship with the sea\n\u2022 Developing partnerships and enhancing collaboration among the municipalities of metropolitan Thessaloniki\nThe strategy comprises around 30 ideas that will define our actions and\npolicies. Thessaloniki was, is and will remain great, it is open to change and\nprogress, it is a place for people to act and interact.\nWe strive to achieve our vision for a resilient Thessaloniki, and we are confident we will achieve it. For Thessaloniki, for the pride of its citizens, for future generations.\nLetter from President of 100 Resilient Cities Michael Berkowitz\nMichael Berkowitz\nPresident of 100 Resilient Cities\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate the\ncity of Thessaloniki, Mayor Boutaris, and Chief Resilience Officer and Deputy\nMayor in Urban Resilience and Development Planning, Lina Liakou on the\nrelease of \u201cThessaloniki 2030\u201d the city's Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for the city and 100RC's partnership with it. An ancient city with a rich history, Thessaloniki builds on its past as it lays the foundations for a resilient future.\nThessaloniki 2030 sets forth an extraordinary vision of urban resilience for all\nthe residents who call this city home.\nFrom its perch on Thermaikos Bay, Thessaloniki has, for thousands of years,\nserved as an important cultural crossroads, with an uncommonly long history\nof diversity, tolerance, and vibrant culture. As the city transforms, it uses\nthis past as a guide for many of the modern challenges it now faces, such as\nshifting demographics that include an aging population and wave of refugees from Syria. This Strategy is a testament to Thessaloniki's reorientation towards its future, and a commitment to implementing actions that ensure the city survives and thrives in the face of its various challenges. From the outset, Mayor Boutaris has shown his commitment to the realization of this vision by appointing the world's first Deputy Mayor for Urban Resilience and Development Planning, ensuring the city has the resources and support for this far-reaching strategy to succeed.\nThis document addresses not only potential shocks such as the sudden influx\nof thousands of refugees, earthquakes, heat waves, and floods, but also the\ncity's multiple stresses, such as air pollution caused by an overreliance on\ncars, high unemployment, and the continuing effects of the national austerity\nmeasures instituted in 2008. It is not a theoretical blueprint, but rather a\nconcrete strategy anchored in the city's operational procedures, and in its\nbudget. It is a complete commitment to the city's, and the region's future.\nThrough her energetic leadership in Thessaloniki, and the 100RC network, Lina Liakou has guided the city to this major moment. She and her team have been active participants and contributors in Europe and the Middle East, and learned important lessons from member cities as far away as San Francisco. Last year, the city's resilience team was a key partner in the development of the 100RC Global Migration Network Exchange in Athens, in which the city shared its own experience with recent migration, absorbed lessons from other cities facing\nsimilar situations, and collaborated to develop new approaches to addressing\nurban migration by elevating the city as a key social policy facilitator. The\nStrategy reflects this kind of coordination and innovative thinking that true\nresilience requires.\nThrough this hard work, and collaboration with key partners, some of the\nstrategy's major initiatives are, impressively, already underway. They include\nGovernment Continuity Plan and Risk Information System, Thessaloniki\nYouth Resilience Challenge, Action Plan on Refugees Integration, adopting\na public space co-creation policy, Open Schools to the neighborhoods, and\nthe Investment Framework for Thermaikos Bay. Work on cross-municipal\ncollaboration has also begun, aiming to build resilience at the metropolitan\nlevel as a vehicle for development. The support of the World Bank and the\nMinistry of the Economy, Development and Tourism also help illustrate that this is a living document that has already begun to strengthen the city.\nThis strategy represents the beginning of the exciting work to come in the\nmonths and years ahead. And 100 Resilient Cities' partnership with the city is\nalso just beginning. Now we can collectively begin implementing the actions\nand initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively impact\nthe lives of all who call Thessaloniki home. From its early work and active\nengagement with the network, Thessaloniki is well positioned to help us in\nleading the global urban resilience revolution. We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these efforts.\nLetter from Chief Resilience Officer\nLina Liakou\nLina Liakou\nDeputy Mayor of Urban Resilience and Development Planning Chief Resilience Officer\nResilience is built on hope, which gives us confidence and strength to act. This Resilience Strategy builds on what we have already achieved and who we are whilst addressing our present and future challenges. It does so by creating\nstructures and processes that will ensure our progress and development. The\nResilience Strategy of Thessaloniki is a roadmap which will help the city to cocreate a more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable city.\nThessaloniki's emerging reputation for international civic innovation positions it alongside other great cities like Rotterdam, New Orleans, and San Francisco. Membership of the 100 Resilient Cities network represents a major step\ntowards creating a strategic, multi-disciplinary approach that is rooted in the\ncity's values and strengths while connecting with national and international\ngoals and initiatives.\nThe basis of our approach is the robust participation and collaboration of more than 40 organizations and 2,000 citizens from across the city. There is also a special focus on the youth of the city. Over the last year, we have formed new partnerships, developed new solutions and ideas, and highlighted existing and ongoing innovation in the city. Rigorous academic research has been aligned with grass-roots initiatives. City policies have been combined and supported by best practices from other cities to develop new objectives, programs and actions.\nIn a city that is constantly changing, this strategy represents the start\nof a process of co-creation. A way to collectively work together, sharing\nresponsibility, resources, opportunities and results.\nAbout this Strategy\nThessaloniki is a city in transformation. We are a\nport city with a long history, and a population that deeply values our history and culture. The city has experienced significant shocks and stresses during the recent past, but despite population shifts, a\ndevastating fire and a major earthquake, we have responded with resilience. Today, Thessaloniki is a lively, multicultural city that attracts young people, tourists, and international business. We are also still focused on recovering from the\nglobal economic depression as well as ongoing\nenvironmental changes.\nThessaloniki was selected in 2014 as part of the\nsecond cohort of cities to join the 100 Resilient\nCities (100RC) network. We consider this a\nunique opportunity to implement a robust,\nparticipatory approach and create a long-term\nstrategy to address current and future challenges, and in doing so to connect with other cities and organizations across the world via the 100RC\nnetwork.\nThe 100RC methodology provided an innovative\nmodel for the local authority to develop a holistic city strategy in collaboration with adjacent municipalities, local academic institutions, the nonprofit sector, private stakeholders, citizens, and communities of the city.\nMore than 40 organizations and 2000 citizens\nparticipated in our resilience dialogue, ensuring\nthe strategy aligns with and complements other\nstrategic initiatives in the local, regional, national\nand international domain, including the city's\n5 year Operational Plan 2020 and European\nStrategy for 2020.\nThe Resilience Strategy reflects our ambitions as a city. We want to be inclusive; locally oriented but with international partnerships and exchanges;\nand forward looking to address interrelated\nchallenges, goals, targets and actions.\nWe envision a city that guarantees the well-being of its people, and nurtures its human talent, while strengthening its urban economy and respecting its natural resources.\nWe will work towards this vision by strengthening Thessaloniki's urban resilience in relation to population shifts, urban economy, open spaces and local governance.\nThe Resilience Strategy is based on eight city\nvalues (Social Cohesion, Local Identity & Heritage, Environmental Management, Health & Wellbeing, Youth Empowerment, Multi-stakeholder Engagement, Technology Adaptation, Economic Prosperity), which represent our city's identity and guide how we will plan for the future. The values cut across four main goals that together form the basis of the strategy:\n\u2022 Shape a thriving and sustainable city: Design and deliver urban and mobility systems that serve people with efficiency, environmental integrity, and strategic use of resources.\nThis includes an integrated mobility system, smart urban logistics plan, clean power, air quality management, and upgraded waste management system.\n\u2022 Co-create an inclusive city: Invest in human talent, including skills, leadership, and entrepreneurship; align education and training to career paths; expand the role of boroughs as social labs; empower citizens and community-led projects; make the city welcoming to new residents; and enable cocreation in open and public spaces.\n\u2022 Build a dynamic urban economy and responsive city: Develop an urban economy policy agenda which recognizes and supports existing and prospective local economic\ncluster activities and zones. Initiate new cross-\nsector partnerships and update governance approaches to allow the city to respond more effectively to the needs of its citizens and a\nchanging world through financial resilience, metropolitan collaboration, capital investment, and risk reduction management plans.\n\u2022 Re-discover the city's relationship with the sea: Integrate the economic and urban development of Thermaikos Bay by investing in the cultural and natural capital of the Bay for improved city life, restoring the ecosystem, monitoring environmental resilience, and\ndesigning a new governance system for managing these activities.\nThese goals are broken down into 30 objectives\nand more than 100 actions, each with multiple\nbenefits for the resilience of our city and\npopulation. Actions include policies, projects, and initiatives (existing and new) that connect goals and city values, from youth participation to clean power for mobility; from waste management to co-ownership of public space and risk reduction.\nThe City of Thessaloniki joined forces with the\nMetropolitan Development Agency of Thessaloniki to create a strategy that delivers both local and metropolitan scale solutions.\nTo guide and promote the implementation of\nthe Resilience Strategy, the city and its partners\nwill monitor progress through local and global\nindicators and data sets. The Resilience Strategy\nalso includes a set of Actions to improve the way\ndata are aggregated, managed and shared. This\nwill further facilitate the monitoring of the strategy by all relevant stakeholders.\nBecoming a truly resilient city requires significant investment in terms of both time and resources.\nIt requires hard work from everyone who lives\nand works in the city. This document reflects\nthe values of the city and provides a roadmap to\nguide the evolution of activities that will help us\nto work together to build resilience for decades to come.\nAbout 100\nResilient Cities\n100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks - earthquakes, fires, floods, etc. - but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis.\nBy addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.\n\u201c City Resilience describes the capacity of cities to function, so that people living and working in\ncities - particularly the poor and\nvulnerable - survive and thrive no matter what stresses or shocks they encounter\nCity Resilience Index, Arup\/Rockefeller Foundation\nAbout The\nCity Resilience Framework\nThe City Resilience Framework (CRF) provides a lens through which the complexity of cities and the numerous factors that contribute to a city's resilience can be understood.

It is Greece's second largest city, home to the country's second largest export and transit port, and the nearest European Union port to the Balkans and Black Sea zone.\nThessaloniki is also considered to have direct influence over the whole region of Central Macedonia, an area of 1.9 million inhabitants (2011 census).\nHistorically, Thessaloniki has strong cultural and economic ties with its neighboring countries in Southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean. Inhabited continuously since 315 BC, it has been part of the Hellenic, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires. It also has a strong Jewish history, which gives the modern city a multicultural character. The city center features a diverse mix of architectural styles including Byzantine, neoclassical, Art Nouveau and Art Deco.\nToday, Thessaloniki is a lively, multicultural city that attracts young people, tourists, and international companies. Culture and history are highly valued by our citizens, and creative, cultural, and tourist projects and initiatives proliferate.\nMunicipal population\n324.766\nMetropolitan population:\n1.12 million\n150,000 students each year - largest student population in the Balkan\n2 million+ visitors per\nyear, with 1.5 million from international locations\n2,300 year history\n31 museums & 15 UNESCO monuments\n50 km coastal front\nPeople\nThessaloniki has the largest youth population\nof any city in Greece, thanks to its wealth of\nlearning and academic institutions and vibrant\nnightlife. The city hosts approximately 150,000\nstudents each year through four public academic institutions, several private colleges, and numerous vocational training colleges. Youth empowerment is already a key topic on the city's agenda, evidenced by the awarding of the title European Youth Capital in 2014.\nDespite its large youth population, the city's\ngreatest demographic challenge is ageing. Over the last decade (2005-2014), the number of residents aged over 65 years has increased from 15.2% to 18.4%.\nThessaloniki experienced significant population\nshifts over the last century. In 1922, the city\ndoubled in size due to the arrival of 130,000\nrefugees fleeing conflict in Asia Minor. This had\nknock-on effects for residential development.\nDuring the Second World War, the city lost\nnearly its entire Jewish population, around 20%\nof the total population in 1940, as 50,000 Greek Jews were sent to concentration camps. The city now plays host to a new wave of refugees from\nSyria and the Middle East. An estimated 15% of\nGreece's total refugee and immigrant population resides in metropolitan Thessaloniki, and while many are in transit to other destinations in\nEurope, a significant number are expected to\nremain in the city.\nCompounding these challenges, Greece's\nrecent economic and social difficulties have\nled to an increase in the population at risk of\npoverty across all ages and social groups. On\nthe positive side, these circumstances have also inspired an increase in citizen-led initiatives, solidarity networks, new skills and resource sharing systems, and demand for more active participation in the everyday life and decisionmaking processes of the city.\nThessaloniki: A City in Transformation\n19\nUrban Environment and Natural Resources\nThe city has a dense urban structure with limited open or green spaces. There is currently 2.6m2 of green space per resident, compared to the\nEuropean average of 8-10m2. The absence or\nfragmentation of green and open space creates\na shortage of suitable leisure environments and\nintensifies the impact of natural phenomena such as high temperatures during the summer and intense rainfalls during the winter. This is further exacerbated by the high density of old, poorly maintained and energy inefficient buildings, particularly in poorer neighborhoods.\nMobility is a major stress affecting the everyday\nlives of Thessaloniki's residents, particularly as it contributes to air pollution, which is one of the city's key current priorities. There are limited\npublic transportation options available at present, causing people to rely heavily on cars. The city's mobility infrastructure is not prepared for major incidents or adequate for future needs. There is currently no integrated plan for mobility systems, and only disjointed plans for new transport\noptions. Inefficient mobility services, high\npopulation density, and lack of public information and awareness about hazards and emergency escape routes compound the potential threat this stress poses to the city and its people.\nThessaloniki is also exposed to some major\nnatural hazards and shocks such as earthquakes, urban floods and forest fires, as well as seasonal and weather-related events that interrupt city\nservices and business continuity, like snow, sub-\nzero temperatures, floods and heat waves.\nThessaloniki's most important natural resource\nis Thermaikos Bay. Thermaikos is a landmark\noffering unique opportunities for sustainable\nurban development. The recent redevelopment of the New Waterfront gave Thermaikos a renewed and important role in the everyday life of its\ncitizens. It is now the most popular public space\nin the city and the number one tourist attraction. Nevertheless, the full potential of the waterfront and the Bay remains underutilized in economic, environmental and leisure terms.\nNatural Hazards\nSurface flooding:\nExtensive flooding in 2009 and 2014\ndemonstrated that, despite Thessaloniki's\nfavorable topography, flood mitigation\ninfrastructure needs to improve. Seven streams in the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki have been classified as prone to flooding.\nDue to poor historic urban development\nregulation, the combined sewer system currently cannot handle peak flows during flood events. The dense urban environment also prevents\nsignificant retention and storage of stormwater.\nThis has contributed to infrastructure failures and localized flooding.\nFire at peri-urban forest:\nIn 1997 the peri-urban forest of Chortiatis was\npartially destroyed by a wildfire. Since then, the\ncity has sprawled towards the forest area.\nPart of the city bypass road is now on the limits\nof the forest, and some of the city's infrastructure is located within the forest area. Consequently, the threat from wildfire to the city has increased. Climate change is also creating additional\nchallenges for the protection of the peri-urban\nforest.\nEarthquakes:\nThis is a major threat to the city and surrounding areas. In 1978, an earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale struck the city leading to 49 deaths, severe damage to infrastructure and\nproperty, and an economic cost of USD 250\nmillion. Projections indicate that an earthquake\nof the same magnitude today would cause 4% of the city's building stock to be damaged beyond repair.\nGovernance and Urban Finance\nLocal authority governance in Greece consists of two main levels: municipalities and regions. The City of Thessaloniki and the municipalities that make up the metropolitan area are part of the Region of Central Macedonia. There is no Metropolitan Governance System operating between the municipality and the regional level.\nThis approach to governance results in the following challenges:\n1)\tLack of economic independence of\nmunicipalities\n2)\tComplicated, disjointed and conflicting jurisdictional boundaries across municipalities, regional authorities and central government on issues like mobility, flood prevention, and risk management\n3)\tThe management of European funds stops at the regional level.\nTo tackle these challenges, Thessaloniki and its neighboring municipalities need to implement an effective, coordinated plan that incorporates all institutions that are relevant at the metropolitan level.\nThe Municipality of Thessaloniki manages a budget of 380million euros for 2017. 50% of the city's budget comes from central government funding, and the remaining 50% comes from taxes, rental revenues and other local sources. The city's ability to attract and manage urban investments is limited because of the current legislative framework and the human capacity of the City administration.\nCurrently the city is heavily dependent on European funding for new urban projects. To enhance its resilience, the city must diversify its funding sources and leverage new partnerships to access private investments that produce a return on investment.\nResilience Journey\n23\nThessaloniki's\nresilience journey\nThessaloniki was selected in 2014 as part of the\nsecond cohort of cities to join the 100 Resilient\nCities (100RC) network. The City of Thessaloniki\nconsiders this a unique opportunity to implement a robust, participatory approach to create a longterm strategy tha addresses current and future\nchallenges.\nThe 100RC methodology provided an innovative\nmodel to help the local authority develop a\nholistic city strategy in collaboration with adjacent municipalities, local academic institutions, the nonprofit sector, private stakeholders, citizens, and communities of the city. The strategy also connects Thessaloniki with other cities and\norganizations across the world via the 100RC\nnetwork.\nMore than 40 organizations and 2,000 citizens\nhave participated in the resilience dialogue\nbetween March 2016 and March 2017, via\ncommittees, working groups, workshops, round tables, and public events.\nThessaloniki's Resilience Strategy also\ncomplements other strategic documents in\nthe local, regional, national and international\ndomain, including the city's 5 year Operational\nPlan 2020 and European Strategy for 2020.\nThis helps to bridge the gap between the\neveryday management of the city and long-term development goals and commitments.\nOrganizational structure\n100RC strategy development process\nThessaloniki has a dense urban structure\nconsisting of 10 municipalities. Despite the\nlack of an integrated metropolitan governance\nstructure, the City of Thessaloniki joined forces\nwith the Metropolitan Development Agency of\nThessaloniki to create a strategy that addresses both local and metropolitan issues and solutions.\nThe organizational structure of the strategy\ndevelopment is presented in the following\ndiagram\nTo prepare the strategy, the Department of\nUrban Resilience followed a two-phase process.\nIn Phase I, an initial resilience assessment was\nconducted and discovery areas were identified. In Phase II, these were explored further, alongside diagnostic and analytical activities that led to the final development of the resilience strategy.\nORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nMunicipalities of the Metropolitan Area\nHow citizens shaped the strategy\nCollaboration and citizen engagement in the\ndevelopment of the strategy were key priorities for the city's administration and the Mayor. The city aims to foster active citizen participation,\nempower self-organizing groups, and support\nnew forms of collective action to address issues of public concern. Continuous participation from diverse stakeholders is essential to the development of every phase of the city's\nResilience Strategy.\nThe strategy development process consisted of the following stakeholder activities:\n1. Building trust amongst stakeholders by assessing perceptions of resilience across\nthe city. This process was conducted via one-to-one interviews, group meetings and workshops, online and in-person\nquestionnaires, and open public events.\n2. Initiating dialogue, broad engagement and participation through various thematic working group meetings, workshops and\nmini-labs focusing on developing new ideas.\n3. Activating the network and beginning resilience-in-action through mini-labs focusing on the implementation of solutions.\nOver a period of 12 months, more than 2,000\npeople and 40 organizations contributed to\nThessaloniki's Resilience Strategy.\nPeople's perceptions of\nThessaloniki\nAnalysis carried out in Phase I revealed that the majority of people in Thessaloniki believe the city to be youthful, somewhat conservative, and lacking in environmental consciousness, but also outward facing and hospitable.\nPeople consider the city's greatest strengths to be its geographic location, its local history, and its culture. Overall, 38% of citizens believe that the municipality should focus on developing the local economy, 25% on improving mobility, and 15% on improving public spaces.\n26\n100 Resilient Cities | Thessaloniki Resilience Strategy\nResilience Thessaloniki Office\nThessaloniki was\nselected in 2014 as part of the second cohort of cities to join the 100RC network.\nAgenda Setting\nWorkshop (ASW)\nThe ASW is the first\nengagement between 100RC, the city and the stakeholders, with the aim to begin to identify and discuss the shocks,stresses and resilience strengths and weaknesses.\nResilience Thessaloniki Office\nThe Urban Resilience\ndiscussion gets\nelevated to a national\nlevel through a joint\nannouncement of the\nResilience Strategy\nLaunch by the Mayors of Thessaloniki and Athens.\nPreliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA)\nThe PRA identifies\nthe city's current\nresilience status, and\ndiscovery areas for\nfurther investigation\nduring Phase II.

This document reflects the values of\nthe city. It is an evolving approach that will help\nus to focus our activities and build resilience for\ndecades to come.\nBy strengthening Thessaloniki's resilience towards its population shifts, urban economy, open spaces and local governance:\nWe envision an inspiring city that ensures the\nwell-being of its people, and nurtures its human talent, while strengthening its urban economy and respecting its natural resources.\nWe will work towards this vision by strengthening Thessaloniki's urban resilience towards its population shifts, urban economy, open spaces and local governance.\nThe following sections outline our strategic\napproaches and in this context, we define:\nCity values represent our city's identity and guide how we plan for the future.\nGoals are longer term statements which address\nthe vision statement and illustrate overall impact.\nObjectives Objectives are mid- and long-term\noutcomes that the city agrees are the most\nimportant to fulfilling the vision and goals.\nObjectives have multiple resilience benefits and\nconnect different goals and city values.\nActions are the specific project level, including\ntactical activities to help accomplish the\nobjectives. Actions can be policies, projects,\nand initiatives. They can be very simple or\ncomplex tasks, at the local or metropolitan scale.

The completion of the main metro line by 2020 will\nbe a major step to improve public transportation, but the city needs to do more.\nDespite an abundance of transport plans and studies for new modes and hubs, Thessaloniki lacks an integrated plan for its mobility system. We will develop a plan that integrates buses and new modes of transport, helping to shift usage away from the private car. Issues of institutionalization (creating a new Public Transport Authority), project planning and prioritization for urban mobility investments, and setting specific targets and policies must be addressed to maximize the capacity and redundancy of the mobility system.\nThis will ensure everyone in the city has access to public transport. It will improve passenger safety by reducing the numbers of accidents and congestion events and it will help to reduce air and noise\npollution. The plan will improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of transporting people and goods around the city. It will contribute to enhancing the design, attractiveness and quality of the urban\nenvironment. And it will help us to plan for and develop non-\nmotorized vehicle and intermodal transport networks.\nAction 01:\tz\nInstitutional reform of the\tApProach\/FrameworK\nPublic Transport Authority\nStakeholder collaboration\nThe bus system is supervised by the Thessaloniki\nPublic Transport Authority (PTA), a decentralized\npublic agency under the Ministry of Infrastructure\nestablished in 2001.\nThePTA is responsible for the supervision of the bus\nsystem (OASTh) but has little authority over the\noverall mobility planning and monitoring of the city.\nThe urgent need to improve the Public Transport\nSystem led to the construction of new transportation\nmodes including the Metro (under construction), and\nUrban Sea Transportation system (under assessment).\nWe will establish a reformed Public Transport\nAuthority with key functions such as: (1) designing,\ntendering and awarding service contracts, (2) planning and monitoring service performance, (3) allocating resources between public transport operators, (4) appraising and prioritizing potential investments to promote a multimodal and integrated public transport system, and (5) managing contingency plans and\nemergency procedures between operators. Inter-\nmunicipal and multi-level governance of ThePTA\nparticipation with local authorities will be crucial to its success.\nTo facilitate institutional coordination on mobility\nprojects, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between MDATh, ThePTA, EGNATIA SA, and HIT\/CERTH under the title \u201cThessaloniki Resilient Mobility System: Integrated System for Urban Mobility and Traffic for the greater area of Thessaloniki\u201d.\nThe scope of the MoU is to build consensus between\nstakeholders by involving organizations from the public sector, technological institutes, and local authorities.\nThe MoU will help all parties to reach an agreement on prioritizing mobility projects and construction of new transportation modes, establishing a business plan for mobility, and sourcing technical assistance and funding from national or global sources.\nWe will implement a holistic plan for a Resilient Mobility System that serves our sustainable development goals and enhances the well-being of everyone in Thessaloniki.\nAction 02:\nRe-structure the Metropolitan In-depth\nSUMP and align local SUMPs\nThe risks of sudden snowfall\nThe development of a Sustainable Urban Mobility\nPlans (SUMP) is not mandatory for local authorities\nin Thessaloniki and currently there are no national\nor regional guidelines on developing a SUMP.\nHowever, since 2011, the European Union has strongly recommended that cities with a population over 100,000 develop a SUMP to facilitate the funding of mobility projects. Local authorities within the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki have started developing their local SUMPs which are applicable within their administrative borders.\nA metropolitan scale SUMP was created by ThePTA\nin 2014 under the EU project framework ATTAC.\nHowever it lacked clear objectives, methods, resources and criteria linked to policies, initiatives or projects to meet the overall vision for the City. We will facilitate the development of a comprehensive SUMP to align\nand embed the local SUMPs under one strategic\nvision. Improving ThePTA will lead to the restructuring of the metropolitan SUMP and will align the local SUMPs.\nAt 10am on 10 January 2017, snow began to fall after\n4 days of subzero temperatures. The snow became\nheavier and by noon had accumulated on city streets,\nimpeding traffic even in the urban center.\nPublic bus services started to fail due to the freezing\ntemperatures, and people tried to leave the city center for residential areas in their cars.\nAccording to the traffic police, there were an estimated 400,000 vehicles that afternoon operating in a road network built for 70,000.\nInevitably, huge traffic jams followed. Key road arteries were blocked for more than five hours and emergency services were unable to move freely, causing major risks across the city.\nThis snowfall should not have caused such a notable\ndisruption in the life of the city and citizens, but\nthe infrastructure and coordination among relevant\nauthorities and stakeholders was inadequate.\nThe event demonstrated the fragility of our mobility\nnetwork and its potential to impact the wider city in the event of a sudden shock. Strengthening this system is essential to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the whole city.\nBasic mobility perceptions, from the Resilience Questionnaire\n1 in 2 people believe more frequent bus services are needed to improve the city's mobility.\n7 out of 10 deem current mobility in the city\ncenter inadequate.\n6 in 10 spend 15-60 minutes commuting on a daily basis.\n1 in 4 believe that improving mobility should be the city's top priority, despite the fact that financial crisis is the major concern of citizens\nAction 03:\nPlan new mobility projects\nDespite the lack of an integrated transport authority\nand a robust metropolitan SUMP, a number of public\ntransport studies are either under assessment\nor construction across the city. We will facilitate\ncoordination between the stakeholders to reform\nthe complicated legal framework and operation\nof the Metro in 2020 to ensure that the proposals\nare complimentary and economically feasible. The\nfollowing activities will be undertaken: 1) consensus of different stakeholders through a MoU (MoU already signed) and 2) secure technical assistance with the aim to;\n\u2022 specify common objectives\n\u2022 update the Origin-Destination matrix\n\u2022 apply the resilience design thinking\n\u2022 perform a holistic Socio-Economic Analysis\n\u2022 perform Financial and Fiscal Analysis for the constructions of each project\n\u2022 rank projects based on their necessity and feasibility and prioritize actions\nPartners in action: Metropolitan Development Agency of Thessaloniki, ThePTA, Egnatia Odos S.A., HIT\/ CERTH, Attiko Metro S.A., Ergose S.A.,Municipalities of Thessaloniki, Regional Authority\nTimescale: Medium Term\nStatus: New\nObjective B:\nAdopt Transit Oriented\nLong delays in the completion of the Metro had devastating impacts on the social and economic fabric of the neighborhoods adjacent to the metro station construction sites, particularly in the city center.\nThis left multiple empty storefronts, precipitated business closures,\nand increased tension and mistrust between business owners,\nresidents and authorities. Metro excavations also revealed significant Byzantine artefacts that need to be protected and preserved.\nThe completion of the Metro stations in 2020 will contribute to\nTransit Oriented Development (TOD) plans that see station areas\nas multimodal hubs, accessible to the residents of the adjacent\nneighborhoods through quality public spaces. This will also deliver\nnew economic development opportunities for people in those\nareas. And it will help to link them to existing mainstream cultural,\neconomic and touristic corridors of Thessaloniki.\nTOD will promote economic development and easy access for\nresidents and neighborhoods. It will also provide new public open\nspaces and enhance tourism opportunities.\nAction 01:\nMap the areas within 400m\nradius from the planned Metro Stations (under construction)\nWe will map the land-uses, available building stock, historical and cultural landmarks, schools and other municipal properties, and mobility flows within a\n400m radius of the metro stations.\nThis will provide the City with the necessary data\nto develop policies and plans for the sustainable\nregeneration of the metro areas.\nAction 02:\nAssess the introduction of\nfurther non-car dominant\ntransit modes\nThe new metro will change how people get around\nin the city. Metro stations, especially in high density\nareas, will become multimodal hubs connecting\ndifferent transportation networks (e.g. Metro and bus networks.\nWe will undertake an assessment of non-car transit\nthrough the re-organization of the bus system,\nprovision of cycling infrastructure (cycle parking,\nlanes, and sharing systems), and car parking areas\n(especially at the stations on the outskirts of the city).\nThis will help to meet the objective of reducing private car use in the City center whilst promoting alternative means of mobility.\nAction 03:\nPrepare sustainable, area-\nwide plans according to TOD\nStandards\nWe will design the urban spaces around the\nmetro stations with new pedestrian zones, street\nfurniture, public art installations, services and\nstructures according to the principles of multimodal\ntransportation.\nThis will contribute to a new identity in these areas\nand create economic development opportunities for\nexisting residents and businesses.\nIn particular, we will focus on the redevelopment of an archaeological plaza in the area of Venizelou Station to connect the metro station and the new Byzantine findings with cultural assets on Egnatia Street.\nThe surrounding area will become a new city\ndestination for both visitors and residents.\nObjective C:\nDevelop smart urban logistics\nPrivate buses, lorries and trucks are the main modes of tourist and commercial transport in the surrounding neighborhoods of the city center.\nDespite the city's effort to regulate day-to-day freight transport using time restrictions and regulations on the size of the lorries, a more integrated approach is needed.\nThis will benefit businesses, the residents and the urban environment by minimizing costs for businesses, reducing the environmental impacts (air and noise pollution) through clean power freight movement (cycling and electromobility) and reducing traffic congestion.\nAction 01:\nData analysis of the existing urban freight distribution system\nThe local economy heavily relies on the small retail and grocery shops.\nWhile there is no data on urban freight distribution, we are sure there are multiple hidden costs and significant environmental impacts in the existing supply chain.\nWe will collect this data, mainly in the historical center, and establish specific metrics for evaluation of proposed reforms.\nBefore proposing new systems of freight distribution, we need to understand the existing urban distribution situation and formulate a clear picture about routes, loads, needs and services, through data collection.\nAction 02:\nFeasibility study about Urban Logistcs Centers\nWe will reorganize the urban freight distribution\nsystem to include a set of regulatory, organizational, operational and technological measures.\nThe core of this is Urban Consolidation Centers. The number of centers, locations, ownership (co-op, public, and private), size and management of these system will be addressed through a feasibility study. This will examine both the current conditions and examples of other systems in cities of a similar size to Thessaloniki.\nFor example the City might choose to take initial\ncontrol (during the start-up phase) and gradually pass ownership to private stakeholders.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, HIT\/\nCERTH\nTimescale: Medium Term\nStatus: New\nAction 03:\nMeasures for clean city distribution\nNew city logistics schemes have to be integrated in\nthe broader context of city mobility and transport\nmeasures to reduce the impact of freight traffic in the city center.\nMeasures under this action will include optimizing\nload and delivery routes, developing added-value\ninnovative services, and rolling out eco-friendly\ndelivery vehicles.\nStrong local consensus among stakeholders will be\nessential to its success.

First we will focus on the transport sector, through\nthe promotion of cycling and the electrification of our car fleet. We want to create a new culture for cycling for everyone in the city. At present, we only have one dedicated 2.5 km cycle lane (completed in 2014 on the waterfront).\nThe other 10km of cycle lanes are restricted to the administrative\nboundaries of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. We will design a new metropolitan cycle lane network connecting the various municipal bike lanes, and including common specifications. Together with\na series of soft actions, this will promote cycling as the preferred\nmode of commuting in the city.\nWe will also electrify the municipal car fleet, and implement\ninfrastructure to promote and facilitate the use of privately owned\nelectric cars (e.g. special lanes, parking spaces). The city will\ncollaborate with the bus operator to replace all public buses with\nelectric buses by 2020.\nThese measures will contribute to climate change mitigation, reduce the city's energy footprint, decrease the use of private cars and traffic congestion, reduce air and noise pollution, and provide a healthy, low-cost alternative mode of transport, accessible to all.\nAction 01:\nDesign of a Metropolitan bike lane network\nThe City of Thessaloniki is part of a broader urban\nagglomeration that consists of 10 municipalities, each with its own sustainable mobility policy and strategy.\nAs a result, many cycle lanes do not connect at a\nmetropolitan scale, hindering the use of bikes for\ncommuting. We will study citizens' commuting\npatterns and flows, including metro, walking and\ncycling to inform the design of a new metropolitan\ncycle lane network that will facilitate and promote\ncycling as an everyday activity.\nWe will also plan and design two additional cycle\nlanes; a bike trail for leisure and sports use along the Regional Channel, the City's most important flood prevention route located at the north-east part of the City; and a bike lane along the waterfront to connect the two ends of Thermaikos Bay, from Kalohori to Aggelohori. This will create a cultural, environmental and tourist-friendly promenade.\nPartners in action: Municipalities of Thessaloniki,\nRegional Authority, ThePTA, Central Government,\nURBACT\nTimescale: Medium Term\nStatus: Planned\nAction 03:\nSoft actions to promote cycling\nAction 04:\nCreate infrastucture for private electromobility\nAlongside the redesign of the cycle lanes and\nthe expansion of the bike sharing system, we will\nimplement the following complementary soft actions to increase cycling as a mode of transport:\n\u2022 Create city maps for bike users, featuring routes, distances, landmarks, bike stands, and bike friendly businesses, areas of interests, water facilities, and shaded routes.\n\u2022 Develop campaigns for the design of personalized routes to highlight the benefits of cycling, specifically targeting areas where university students live\n\u2022 Establish bike-related festivals and events (e.g. sustainable mobility week, car-free day, bike-day)\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki,\nThePTA, bike communities\nTimescale: Short Term\nThe city has limited authority to regulate the use of\nprivate electric cars.\nHowever, we will facilitate access to electric charging points by offering incentives in selected locations within the city limits, such as allocation of special parking spaces, reduction of parking fees, introduction of Low Emissions Zones, and electric car sharing stations.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, HIT\/\nCERTH\nTimescale: Long Term\nStatus: New\nStatus: Planned\nAction 05:\nConvert the city car fleet to electric\nAction 06:\nMake all public buses electric\nThessaloniki is part of the \u201cCovenant of Mayors for\nClimate & Energy\u201d.\nMember cities are committed to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and adopt an integrated approach to tackling climate change mitigation and adaptation.\nAccording to the city's existing Sustainable Energy\nPlan, 30% of our CO2 emissions reductions will come\nfrom the transport sector.\nTo achieve this, we will gradually replace the old\nmunicipal vehicles with new electric vehicles and make the City a leader in clean-powered transport.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki Timescale: Long Term\nStatus: Planned\nThe current public bus fleet is one of the worst air\npolluters in the City. It is paramount that the bus\noperators replace public buses with electric powered buses.\nAs the city has limited authority in this area (based on 1370\/2007 EU Regulation), central government will need to re-negotiate existing terms with bus operators and impose new regulations and specifications to promote clean transport.\nThe City has actively declared our need for more\nenvironmentally responsible bus operations.\nWe will work with the government with and participate in any new scheme to improve public transport and the environment.\nPartners in action: Central Government, ThePTA,\nMunicipalities of Thessaloniki\nTimescale: Medium Term\nStatus: Planned\nObjective E:\nReduce air pollution and urban noise\nAir pollution is one of Thessaloniki's most pressing environmental challenges. The city does not have accurate information on current air quality levels due to inconsistencies in data collection across municipal and regional authorities.\nThere is also currently no Air Quality Management System in operation in greater Thessaloniki. We will create a common platform to centralize and coordinate air quality stations in the metropolitan\narea.\nThis will create a robust and reflective tool for air quality assessment and monitoring. We will also establish a metropolitan air quality fund to support air quality projects recognized as best practice worldwide e.g. metropolitan bike lanes, free public transports on heavily polluted days etc. This tool and the governance structure that supports it may also be used to address urban noise pollution.\nMonitoring and evaluating the city's air quality will help to improve air quality, mitigate air pollution, protect the health of citizens, especially children, and safeguard historical assets which are prone to deteriorate in the presence of air pollutants.\nAction 01:\nOperate an Air Quality\nManagement System (AQMS)\nof Thessaloniki\nAir pollution is both a shock and a stress. A stress\nwhen associated with ongoing private car use, and a\nshock in relation to incidents such as peri-urban forest fires, odors in the western suburbs, and wild fires at landfill sites.\nThe EU Air Quality Directive (2008\/50) encourages\ncities to introduce air quality assessment and\nmanagement protocols to facilitate monitoring and\ninform decision making. The regional authority of\nThessaloniki has such a system - intended to provide\ndaily forecasting and an interactive interface for\nemissions scenario - however it is not currently\noperational.\nWe will advocate for the re-instatement of the system and facilitate closer collaboration with the Public Transport Authority on air pollution forecasting and scenario building.\nPartners in action: Municipalities of Thessaloniki,\nRegional Authority, AUTh\nTimescale: Medium Term\nStatus: New\nAction 02:\nUpgrade the air quality\nmonitoring system and\nintroduce new stations\nThe City maintains seven air quality and\nmeteorological stations within the City's limits.

Compounded by meteorological factors that week (weak wind), an increase in air pollution was directly linked to the absence of public transport services.\nThis event highlighted the link between good air quality\nand the existence of a robust, clean and redundant public transport system.\nIt also caused many people to avoid the city center during this time, with consequences for access to services and the local economy. In September 2016, another strike\nlasted nearly two weeks, highlighting that this is an\nongoing concern.\nAction 03:\nDesign Low Emission Zones and Neighborhoods\nTo improve air quality and reduce noise pollution,\ncities are implementing initiatives such as low traffic\ndays and the closing of certain streets at particular\ntimes.\nA number of measures aimed at reducing private\ncar usage have already been undertaken in the City\ncenter.

These are collected in separate locations.\nThis is quite limited and we know we need to move on\nfrom the current linear model - the 'take, make, use and throw away' approach - to a new more sustainable waste management system in which product loops and materials chains are closed, and new economic models are developed.\nAdopting a circular economy approach at the city level requires a workforce with specific skills in redesigning products and services and upcycling used materials extracted from these products. Adopting this approach will also allow us to create new business and employment opportunities.\nCircular city strategies need to go hand in hand with bottom-up initiatives by citizens and private companies. Empowering people to bring their own ideas into practice generates enthusiasm for the circular economy and mobilises the people's creativity.

Boroughs consist of an elected Borough Council and a Borough President.\nTheir responsibility is to serve the district's residents, from being the intermediary between the citizens and local authorities, to ensuring the neighborhood's emergency preparedness.\nA recent survey (Resilient Thessaloniki questionnaire) revealed that although the majority of city residents (82%) are aware of the existence of their local\nBorough, they are not clear on its role in response\nto certain issues. Consequently, they tend to submit\nrequests and complaints directly to the central\nMunicipal Departments which often results in delays\ndue to bureaucracy.\nThe city will initiate an awareness campaign to re-\nintroduce the role of the Boroughs to citizens. The\nfirst step will be the re-branding of the each Borough, in collaboration with local creative communities.\nThis aims to bring the Boroughs closer to the\nneighborhood and transform their responsibility into a more inspiring and meaningful service that meets citizens' needs.\nThe city will use communication channels including\nlocal TV, radio, internet (websites, social media)\nto increase the effectiveness of the campaign and\norganize a kickoff event entitled the \u201cBorough Open\nDay\u201d in each of the 6 Boroughs of the city.\nBy simplifying the communication of Boroughs'\nservice offering and establishing the Boroughs as\nthe \u201cfront - desk\u201d for local public services, the city\nwill create a more efficient and inclusive governance model.\nPartners in action: Boroughs, Municipality of\nThessaloniki\nTimescale: Short Term\nAction 02:\nEstablish a consultation\nprocess in the local Boroughs\nAccording to existing legislation, each Borough\ncouncil is required to hold deliberation meetings with the local community (neighborhood assembly) and contribute to shaping the City's Development Plan by submitting a proposal to the City Council in a specific timeframe.\nThe City Council is obliged to take into consideration the priorities suggested by the city's Boroughs. Currently, this policy is partially implemented in some of the Municipalities of the Metropolitan Area but the overall process is deemed ineffective.\nTo streamline this process and assist the creation and approval of the City's Development Plan, the city will create a meeting calendar and specific agenda, in\ncollaboration with the Boroughs' Directors and in line with local and national timeframes and requirements.\nBoroughs' deliberation meetings, are expected to\nempower citizens and encourage them to get involved in the co-creation of their urban environment.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki,\nBoroughs\nTimescale: Short Term\nStatus: New\nStatus: Planned\nAction 03:\nInitiate participatory\nbudgeting in Boroughs\nAction 04:\nCreate a portfolio of methods for Boroughs to enable community-led projects\nIn collaboration with the Borough's Council, the City will initiate a step-by-step process for establishing Participatory Budgeting in Boroughs.\nThe project aims to put budget decisions directly\nin the hands of those directly affected: the local\nresidents.\nA year-long process including neighborhood\nassemblies will include the following steps: inform\nthe community; develop, exchange and debate ideas; collaborate to turn ideas into proposals; evaluate and vote on the best projects which will receive funding.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki,\nBoroughs\nTimescale: Medium Term\nStatus: New\nUnder current legislation, a portion of the City budget is allocated to each Borough to finance activities such as campaigns, events and neighborhood projects.\nBoroughs must declare beforehand where and how\nthe budget will be spent.\nUnfortunately, due to lacking resources, the money is not always spent most effectively.\nTo tackle this, a portfolio of new methods and staff\ntraining sessions will be set up to help Borough staff\ndesign and deliver innovative services that will enable and facilitate community-led projects.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, Medium Term, Boroughs, civic empowerment organizations, local NGOs\nTimescale: Short Term\nStatus: New\nAction 05:\nDevelop Borough Emergency Plans\nAction 06:\nEstablish June 20th as \"City Resilience Day\"\nIn collaboration with the Boroughs, the city will build\non existing city emergency plans to develop tailored\nemergency plans for each of the six Boroughs, taking into account their particular demographics, assets and resources.\nThe plans will be developed according to the National Civil Protection Department Guidelines and involve participation from local schools, NGOs, and youth organizations.\nPartners in action: Boroughs, Municipality of\nThessaloniki, local schools, NGOs, youth organizations Timescale: Short Term Status: New\nThessaloniki's great earthquake of 20 June 1978\ncaused the death of 50 people, injury of another\n220, and left thousands more to the homeless.

These include: customer perceptions of the area, parking policy, street management, vacant units, and the lack of promotional opportunities.\nThe establishment of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) can help increase certainty for businesses around some of these issues. BIDs are legally and geographically defined partnerships for area improvement and service delivery, funded by levypaying businesses within an agreed boundary.\nThey are managed and operated by a BID Company\n- usually a non-profit company run by and for its members. Businesses set priorities for local investment to be used only in the place where they do\nbusiness. BIDs can bring regeneration benefits locally for the whole community and regionally for the wider\neconomy by attracting additional funding - such as public realm and infrastructure improvements - and increasing footfall and staff retention through place promotion and economic development.\nPartnership working can bring benefits like saving businesses money by joint procurement, reducing crime, building local networks and supporting local supply chains, and giving businesses a stronger voice within their local municipality.\nPartners in action: Business Associations and Chambers, Municipality of Thessaloniki Timescale: Medium Term\nStatus: New\nFeatured project\nGlobal learning\nRegenerating traditional urban markets in the city center: Kapani Agora\nIn recent years, there has been a resurgence in interest and renewed appreciation for public markets. Public markets contribute to urban revitalization. They also play a central role in community life and diversity, contribute to better public health outcomes, and strengthen links between rural and urban economies.\nThe historic part of Thessaloniki's city center contains four markets and more than 800 small businesses, including Kapani Agora, the oldest open market in the city. In recent years, the markets have seen a decline in visitors and trade due to the economic recession. However, there has also been an increase in the number of creative professionals, business owners and freelancers locating in the area.\nIn 2016, local business owners launched a new brand identity and visual logo for Kapani, created through inclusive design processes with local partners. We believe the market has the potential to lead the regeneration of the historic markets, and contribute to the wider regeneration of the city center. This design project signifies a modest start in that direction, contributing to place-making and community engagement that will benefit all of Thessaloniki.\nAs part of the medium and long-term strategy to regenerate the historic markets, we will establish a Business Improvement District (BID) and develop an Integrated Market Redevelopment Strategy for the area.\nPartners include the Professional Association of the Historic City Center, Business and Cultural Development Center (KEPA), Design for Europe, the Design Council, Resilient Thessaloniki, Youthnest, and Creativity Platform.\nThe power of public markets to impact communities: the case of Barcelona\nBarcelona has a network of more than 40 public markets. Every neighborhood has its own, each serving approximately 25,000 residents. The markets collectively provide over 7,500 jobs serving 1.6 million people through 65 million visits per year and a \u20ac1 billion in turnover. Barcelona made the conscious decision to use its markets to revitalize the city. From 2011-2015, the city invested \u20ac133 million in market renovations; 25 markets have now undergone major restorations. Barcelona saw this as an opportunity to reinforce social cohesion, improve environmental conditions, boost tourism, and contribute to the city's global reputation as a hub for food culture.\nAction 02:\nDevelop an Integrated Market\nRedevelopment Strategy for\nKapani Markets\nWe will develop an Integrated Market Redevelopment Strategy for the Kapani market in consultation with the associations of business owners and professionals.

They actively engage by expressing what their needs are and brainstorming ideas. In certain cases, they may even voluntarily provide data and information to help other partners in the quadruple-helix to understand citizens' behaviors and needs.\nSocial Impact bonds, also known as pay-for-success financing, are performance\ncontracts between the government and private funders (e.g. investment banks). In\nprojects financed by social impact bonds, the private sector is responsible for financing and implementing a social service (e.g. school, community development, correctional facility, etc.) and will only receive repayments by the government if prescribed,\nquantified performance metrics are met.

The campaigns will promote\nsustainable development, particularly in view of the envisioned new coastal infrastructure. By enhancing environmental consciousness this action supports the campaign for a cleaner Bay as a bottom-up approach.\nPartners in action: Centre for environmental education, Municipality of Thessaloniki , community groups Timescale: Short Term\nStatus: Ongoing\nAction 02:\nDevelop environmental\nmonitoring tools\nSafeguarding the environment of Thermaikos is a\ntop priority. The development of smart monitoring\nsystems is crucial to this goal. We will use continuously expanding environmental data to understand the main sources of contaminations and what their impacts are on receptor systems.\nWe will develop integrated monitoring tools, from\ndata gathering and management to GIS integration\nand modelling.\nThis will provide information to help make informed\ndecisions about restoring the ecosystem. These tools\nwill also help to predict and monitor the impacts of future infrastructure interventions.\nPartners in action: Water Secretariat, Municipality of Thessaloniki, AUTH, Region, Water Authority Timescale: Medium Term\nStatus: New\nIn-depth\nConsequences of contamination\nThe figure shows the consequences of contamination\n(water quality risks) prioritised based on their impact. The impact of each water quality risk on public health, the environment and the ecosystems, and the aesthetics (i.e. visual impacts, odour etc) was qualitatively assessed using a low-medium-high scale.\nThe risk with the higher score under each impact\nshould be determined after considering the possibility of occurrence of each event\/risk. This figure shows an\nindicative assessment based on expert-judgement.\nThe risk that will have the most detrimental impact, overall, will depend on the city's take on each of the impact parameters, e.g. parameters could be expanded in a similar sense to other sectors (i.e. social impact, financial impact, long term impact\/sustainability etc).\nAction 01:\nRestore the natural beaches\nMarine infrastructure developed along the waterfront during the 1960s eliminated most of the natural beaches of Thessaloniki.\nThis action supports the restoration of the remaining beaches as places of significant recreational and aesthetic value. Restoration studies will be carried out to evaluate cost-benefits and proceed to the implementation of restoration measures.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, AUTH Region of Central Macedonia Timescale: Aspirational\nStatus: New\nAction 02:\nUpgrade the Combined Sewer Overflows Infrastructure\nThessaloniki's Water Authority set up its wastewater treatment plant in the 1990s. This effectively reversed environmental degradation observed until then.\nHowever, the occasional overflow of the combined\nsewer system now occurs during strong rainfall event, posing a risk to the Bay.\nThe Water Authority has already put in place a real-\ntime monitoring system to manage the overflow\nand minimize spillage. It also has plans to upgrade\nthe Combined Sewer Overflows to further reduce\nthe frequency of events and the total volume of\nwastewater spilled in the Bay.\nPartners in action: Water Authority, Municipality of\nThessaloniki\nTimescale: Medium Term\nStatus: Ongoing\nAction 03:\nIntroduce the use of renewable energy in the waterfront\nThermaikos provides a test-case to prove the case for a shift to renewables, which can provide affordable, reliable and environmentally friendly energy. Fuel\nvehicles have already been prohibited from use on the waterfront and the waste collection fleet is based on electrical energy.\nA collaborative project between the water authority\nand the municipality will seek to explore the energy\ngeneration potential from wasterwater collected at\npumping stations along the waterfront using heat-\nexchange technology.\nOpportunities for further green energy generation and use will be explored through stakeholder partnerships.\nThis action aims at bringing sustainability practices to the forefront of the vision for Thermaikos.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, Water Authority\nTimescale: Long Term\nStatus: New\nAction 01:\nImproving the governance of\nthe Bay\nTo improve the governance of the Bay, a clear process needs to be set out alongside 4 related actions.\na.\tMap relevant players and roles: We will develop a\nstakeholder map covering all those involved in the\ngovernance of Thermaikos and the management of its assets. The EU funded project, MedSeaTies, will form the basis for the completion of the survey. The survey will include participatory features to understand\nperceptions of each actor on their own involvement\nand role. The survey will identify power overlaps\nand gaps in governance, and the barriers to efficient\ngovernance and adaptation pathways.\nb.\tDe-centralize authority from Athens to stakeholders in Thessaloniki. The EU biodiversity strategy 2020 calls for coordination at all levels to promote efficient governance and management. In Greece, this trend has taken place through partial transfer of powers\nto local authorities or new bodies managing specific\necosystems, such as the Axios Delta on Thermaikos\nwest end. The transfer of centralized powers from\nAthens to Thessaloniki-based bodies would facilitate\nefficient management by eliminating fragmentation\nand raising the issue as a priority.\nc.\tForm consensus on a vision around an MoU with\na long term goal. Formulating a common vision for\nThermaikos by the critical stakeholders and actors\nidentified in (a) and (b) will put development on a fast track. A Communication Platform will transform to an Action Alliance once consensus has been built around specific economic or environmental issues.\nd.\tCreate a new entity to manage the Bay activities.\nThe long term vision for the governance of Thermaikos is the creation of a new entity which will have the authority to manage or coordinate the Bay activities.\nPartners in action: Municipalities of Thessaloniki,\nCentral Government\nTimescale: Long Term\nStatus: New\nAction 01:\nDevelop a cultural strategy for Thermaikos Bay\nThe numerous cultural assets in close proximity of\nThermaikos waterfront are physically disconnected at the municipal and metropolitan scales.\nThis action aims to create a cultural narrative for\nThermaikos: the ecosystem itself forms a natural link between the disconnected landmarks.\nThe action promotes the development of physical\ninfrastructure to create this link, but also the\ndevelopment of digital tools to enhance it.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki,\nCultural Institutions and networks, Creatives (Artists, Storytellers), Cultural Managers, Media Timescale: Medium Term\nAction 02:\nCrowdsourcing ideas and\npromoting community\nparticipation on the waterfront\nThe new waterfront has triggered grassroots initiatives and the organization of numerous cultural events along the promenade.\nThe City aims to further foster the active participation of citizens for both cultural and urban development of the Bay through crowdsourcing of new ideas in\ncollaboration with NGOs and community groups.\nPartners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki,\nCommunity groups, Cultural institutions and networks, NGOs, residents associations, local entrepreneurs Timescale: Short Term\nStatus: New\nStatus: New\nStrategy\nImplementation\nMonitoring and\nEvaluation Process\nDeveloping the strategy is the first step on our journey towards a more resilient future.

The aim is to become a Resilience Champion city by applying innovative solutions to problems and responsibly including the thoughts and actions of citizens. The city invites all allies to act for, and cooperate in, the development of tomorrow's resilient Surat\u2014a cohesive, robust, and sustainable city.\nMRS. ASMITABEN P. SHIROYA Mayor, Surat\nOur community's resilience rests on our people and our ability to live well in good times and bounce back stronger than ever from the inevitable hard times. Developed with input and insights from the people of Surat, the Resilience Strategy is designed to articulate solutions that make our city more resilient not only to physical challenges, such as floods and aging infrastructure, but also to social challenges, such as cohesion and urban health. Surat's Resilience Strategy is the launch point for several programs that foster these connections and partnerships. These programs that I am excited about, will enable several community-based organizations to serve as hosts for training and conduits to services that are tailored to meet the needs of people. These programs are good example of what the practice of resilience looks like\u2014it addresses more than one challenge at once and creates multiple benefits for many people.\nI am proud of the many partnerships that have made the Resilience Strategy possible, and I look forward to forming many additional partnerships that will enable its implementation. 100 Resilient Cities (100RC)\u2014pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation\u2014has provided invaluable support, guidance, and access to technical assistance. Other Indian cities\u2014 Chennai, Pune, and Jaipur\u2014are also participating in 100RC, and continued collaboration in the region will help to amplify our work beyond the boundaries of our respective cities. Most of all, I am grateful to the Surat community for contributing to the Resilience Strategy and for what you do every day to make Surat the active, dynamic, and highly engaged community that it is. I invite all community members to review this report with an eye towards how you can join your friends, neighbors, and colleagues in making Surat a model of city resilience.\nBest wishes,\nMrs. Asmita Shiroya Mayor, Surat\nMR. MICHAEL BERKOWITZ President, 100 Resilient Cities\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate the city of Surat, Mayor Asmitaben Shiroya, and Chief Resilience Officer Kamlesh Yagnik, on the release of the Surat Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for the city and 100RC's partnerships with it. A dynamic city with a rich history, Surat builds on its past as its lays the foundations for a resilient future. This document sets forth an extraordinary vision of urban resilience for all the residents who call this city home.\nSurat's resilience work builds on years of close collaboration with the Rockefeller Foundation, which began with the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network. The Resilience Strategy reflects this through the amazing progress the city has made in understanding its resilience challenges and embracing the holistic thinking and planning that true resilience requires. Through initiatives and actions that strengthen the city as a whole, the Strategy enables Surat to addresses its past challenges while also recognizing the increasing unpredictability of the future.\nWhile the Strategy addresses the fissures formed by the city's rapid growth, it goes much further. Alongside the enforcement of traffic rules, driving license norms, quality of life assessment, and guidelines on open public space, the Strategy also includes innovative and progressive initiatives such as a health and action plan that emphasizes the connection between urbanization, climate change and public health, support for women entrepreneurs, and promotion of civic engagement. Through this multifaceted blueprint for the city's present and future, Surat has the opportunity to lead not only in India, but throughout the 100RC network, and the world.\nCentral to all of these efforts are the people of Surat. The Strategy provides for creative public outreach to spread awareness of the city's challenges and the role of all residents in working to strengthen the city. It also dedicates an entire pillar to social cohesion that celebrates the city's heritage while also embracing the city's immigrants and their contributions to their adopted home.\nThis Strategy is a new and exciting chapter of Surat's resilience work and its relationship with 100R. It is also a beginning. It marks the start of exciting work to come in the months and years ahead. Now we can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively impact the lives of all who call Surat home. We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these efforts.\nBest wishes,\nMr. Micheal Berkowitz\nPresident, 100 Resilient Cities\nMunicipal Commissioner,\nSurat Municipal Corporation\nThe 100 Resilient Cities (RC) Challenge seeks to work with 100 cities across the globe to build resilience to address social, economic, and physical challenges that are faced by cities in an increasingly urbanized world. 100RC facilitates the building of a global practice of resilience among governments, NGOs, private sector, and citizens.\nSurat Resilience Strategy provides a platform for people from across sectors, institutions and interest groups to come together and help address the critical question of what can we do to protect and improve the way of life of citizens of Surat in the present and in the future. At the behest of SMC various stakeholders worked together to identify issues that impact Surat's resilience.\nI am confident that Surat will become India's champion for resilience, extending and integrating our already ground-breaking work in fields such as climate change adaptation, sustainable service provision, and integrated planning, and provide an example for other cities in 100RC to learn from.\nBest wishes to all who are working on this endeavor. Surat Municipal Corporation provides wholehearted support to this strategy.\nRegards,\nMr. N. Thennarasan, IAS\nMunicipal Commissioner,\nSurat Municipal Corporation\nMR. MILIND TORAWANE, IAS\nSecretary, Urban Development\nDepartment, Government of Gujarat\nIn building resilience, we will reduce dependency. Surat Resilience Strategy creates a safer tomorrow for our community. Working together will give us the best defense to face the next shock or stress.\nRegards,\nMr. Milind Torawane, IAS\nSecretary\nUrban Development Department\nGovernment of Gujarat\nMR. M. NAGARAJAN, IAS\nChief Executive Officer,\nSmart City Development Ltd, Surat\nInvolvement of citizens in leading to transform Surat into Smart & Resilient City is amazing. Surat Strategy aims to integrate the smarter needs of resident of Surat City. Smart and resilient city is about transformation, rejuvenation, and future design. Smart and Resilient City is about the processes to be followed and evolved not a final destination. Our vision is of a smart and resilient city that places citizens at the center of its projects by continuous involvement of all actors.\nMr. M. Nagarajan, IAS\nChief Executive Officer,\nSurat Smart City Development Ltd, Surat\nMR. JATIN SHAH\nAdvisor, Surat Municipal Corporation\nThe Resilience is in the blood of the Suratis (popularly referred to people of Surat). The Surat Resilience strategy seeks to turn its existing challenges into opportunities. The aim is to become a champion city by applying innovative solutions to problems and responsibly including the thoughts and actions of citizens. The city invites all allies to act for, and cooperate in, the development of tomorrow's resilient Surat\u2014a cohesive, robust, and sustainable city. We are very positive towards this movement to thrive towards resilient and adaptation to climate change.\nMr Jatin Shah\nAdvisor, Surat Municipal Corporation\nManaging Trustee, Surat Climate Change Trust\nMR. KAMLESH YAGNIK\nChief Resilience Officer, Surat\nSurat faces a diverse range of issues. Tidal flooding and flash floods, sanitation and waste management, and congestion among others, are the issues the city currently deals with. Surat city's government, together with all of the city elements, has worked to overcome these challenges, both through improved physical and non-physical infrastructures. As for the future, I hope that with this City Resilience Strategy Document, Surat, along with all its challenges, will become a more resilient city and develop into a modern and sustainable city.\nMr. Kamlesh Yagnik\nChief Resilience Officer, Surat\nSTATEMENT OF RES\nThe daily problems of traffic jams and choked roads in Surat affect connectivity and mobility. This is especially an issue during peak hours when even ambulances and other emergency vehicles could get stuck in traffic. Surat also suffers from a lack of enforcement of the traffic management system. Factors such as a large number of private vehicles, an inefficient public transport system, inadequate parking facilities, unsatisfactory footpaths for pedestrians, encroachments on existing footpaths and road margins, as well as informal and small-time business activities on major corridors\u2014all contribute to the congestion of roads in the city. To curb encroachments, it is necessary for the traffic police to come up with an effective mechanism which would also ease traffic flow in the city. WRI through its UCRA engagement will be supporting Surat to understand & potentially resolve issues relating to informal settlements access to public transit\nA wide range of industrial and commercial activities take place in Surat. People from rural areas and other less-developed states flock to the city seeking employment opportunities in the industrial, allied, and service sectors; in trade and business activities; and in hawking, retailing, carting, and other such activities. This has resulted in slums and low income settlements along the riverside and in low-lying, risk-prone areas. There is a huge demand for affordable housing in the city to cater to the migrant population. According to a research report by the real estate consulting firm, Cushman & Wakefield, Surat tops a list of 11 Indian cities that are witnessing a surge in housing demand (TOI, 2016). PWC & WRI respectively will support Surat in understanding & finding solution related to affordable housing.\nThe Surat Municipal Corporation manages the water needs of the city. At present, the main source of water for the entire city is the river Tapi. The river\u2019s water quality is deteriorating\u2014 anthropogenic activities and development along the riverside contribute to large-scale pollution of the river\u2019s water. In such a situation, both water quality and quantity will be a big challenge for Surat. Options for finding alternate sources of water, such as getting water from Kakrapar weir by pipeline, need to be worked out.Also, the city needs to work on various water models, for example, the \u2018Four National Taps\u2019 model of Singapore (PUB, 2016).1 Potentially Surat will tie with partners like Veolia & Deltares to work its water related initiative.\nSurat, known for its polishing, textile manufacturing, and diamond cutting industries, is heavily dependent on the latter two dominant economic sectors. Recession in these two sectors has had a significant impact on the city\u2019s economy (UNDP, 2009). The economy is also characterized by a large number of small and medium scale unorganized industries. The industrial base is labor-intensive. The level of unemployment is low; wages are also low and the workers are generally deprived of social and other security benefits. The city should\nILIENCE CHALLENGE\ninvite different alternative industries, such as information technology, automobile, tourism, etc., as backup livelihood providers in case economic crises occur.\nThe environment and ecosystem of the city and its surrounding areas\u2014critical determinants of the health of its inhabitants\u2014 impact work-related productivity and urban quality of life. Situated on the banks of the river Tapi, and with its proximity to the Arabian Sea, Surat has a sensitive ecosystem. Industrial growth, as well as high population growth and density, put pressure on this ecosystem. Implementation of environmental policies, such as coastal regulation and enforcement of laws in industrial areas, is important. More green spaces need to be developed and maintained. The Tapi is depleting due to rapid siltation and development along both sides of the river. The environmental cell should be more active and efficient in monitoring air pollution and water pollution, as water supply to the city is dependent on the river. CDIA will support Surat in understanding & finding solution related to coastal preservation.\nSocial cohesion and social networks are weak in Surat. Communities are at peace in the city, but they are not connected. Stronger efforts from society and the government should be made to establish social connectivity and stability. Regulations and policing will be crucial for the city to manage a population that is quite large, with much diversity existing among the communities. To sustain stability, a sense of unity and cultural values must be embraced by the people and administration. PWC will support Surat in understanding City\u2019s Social Cohesion issues.\nSurat has a well-developed health infrastructure, including government health centers and private health services, but there is a need for skilled and specialized human resources. The upscaling of 3ublic health needs to be achieved by increasing awareness and capacity building against urban health challenges. Surat is infamous for vector- and waterborne diseases. The seasonality of vector-borne diseases is likely to keep changing, there may be an expansion in the disease transmission period due to increased temperatures and changes during the humid season. Being an urban ecosystem, Surat is also prone to increase other lifestyle diseases and pollution caused diseases. Potentially Save The Children will support Surat in understanding & finding solution related to Public health.\nBrief Profile of Surat City\nLocation\nSurat, located in the western part of India in the state of Gujarat, on the banks of the river Tapi, is an important historical trade center and serves as a trade link between India and the Gulf countries. Even during the Mughal period, Surat was a gateway to the Deccan plateau and an important port and trading center. Today, the city has one of the highest proposed investments and almost zero percent unemployment. It is one of the fastest growing cities in India.\nSurat is an important commercial city in south Gujarat, and is approximately 250 kilometers (km.) north of Bombay. The city is located\nat 21\u00b010' N - 72\u00b049' E, with an altitude of about 13 meters (m.) above mean sea level (AMSL).\nLocated at the mouth of the Gulf of Khambhat, Surat experiences a tidal range of about 5 to 6 m. The monthly high tide reaches the western parts of the city. Surat district is surrounded by Bharuch, Narmada (North), Navsari, and Dang (South) districts. The Gulf of Khambhat is to the west of the city. Surat is a port city; the nearest port now is Hazira, located at the mouth of the Tapi. In the distant\npast, the old city had flood protection systems, including flood walls and gates, which are not present any more.\nSurat has a tropical monsoon climate. Summer temperatures in Surat range from 37 to 44 degree Celsius and winter temperatures drop to 22 degree Celsius. Monsoon begins in June and lasts till the end of September, with the average temperature being around 28 degree Celsius during those months. Average annual rainfall is approximately 1,200 millimeters (mm.) (IMD, 2016).\nSurat, located between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, has a good connectivity in terms of roads and railways, and more recently by air. The Golden Quadrilateral\u2014a highway network connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai\u2014passes through Surat. The city is connected to NH8 through a 16-km. connector highway. NH6 and NH228 pass through Surat, connecting various major towns and cities of India. The airport at Surat is functional since 2008 and connects Surat with Delhi and Mumbai.\nLike the major business centers of early historical times, which developed along the banks of rivers, Surat too developed along\nthe banks of the Tapi which flows into the Arabian Sea, just 16 km. from the city. The river dictates the topology of the city as the\nlandscape slopes gradually from Northeast to Southwest.\nSurat has seen an unprecedented growth in the last four decades, recording one of the highest growth rates in the country and a 10fold population rise. It now ranks as the eighth largest city in the country (Census, 2011). Coupled with this, a spillover of population into the peripheral areas has also been observed. From time to time, the jurisdictional limits of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) have been extended to include the growth.\nSurat faces risks of both sea level rise and flooding. The Ukai multipurpose dam built upstream, 94 km. from Surat, was meant for flood control management, besides irrigation and power generation. During the last two decades, Surat and the surrounding metropolitan region has witnessed major floods.\nThe city is prone to high tides, flooding, extreme heat, and subsequent health risks.\nCity Growth\nBefore 1961, Surat comprised an area of 8.12 sq. km.; by 2009 it had expanded to 326.5 sq. km. The oldest part of the city developed between the train station and the parts known as\nAthwalines. Since the 1990s, most new development, including the most desirable locations for the city's burgeoning middle and upper class, has taken place in the areas lying between Athwalines and the Arabian Sea.\n1.1\tBackground\nResilient Cities\nPioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) helps cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC views resilience not just as shocks\u2014earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.\u2014but also as stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis. Examples of these stresses include high unemployment, an overtaxed or inefficient public transportation system, endemic violence, or chronic food and water shortages. By addressing both the shocks and the stresses together, a city is better equipped to respond to adverse events and is overall better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad to all populations.\nResilience Strategy\nA resilience strategy helps cities prepare for, adapt to, and quickly rebound from, shocks and stresses. The objective of the resilience strategy is to provide a roadmap for the Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) to build resilience in the city.\nThe resilience strategy serves as a tactical roadmap to build resilience in the city. It articulates the city\u2019s priorities for building resilience through specific initiatives for immediate implementation as well as the city\u2019s longer continued path. The resilience strategy triggers action, investment, and support within city government and from outside groups. Rather than a static roadmap, the resilience strategy is a living document to be continuously fine-tuned as priorities are addressed and initiatives get implemented.\nACUTE SHOCKS\nAcute shocks include hurricanes, flooding, heat waves, fire, hazardous materials accidents, tornados, terrorism, disease outbreaks, riots\/civil unrest, infrastructure\/building failures, etc.\nCHRONIC STRESSES\nChronic stresses include lack of affordable housing, pervasive\/high unemployment, poverty\/inequity, homelessness, aging infrastructure, water or air pollution, droughts and water shortages, rising sea levels and coastal erosion, crime and violence, societal instability, depressed macroeconomic conditions, etc.\nRESILIENCE\nResilience is the capacity of individuals,\tcommunities,\nbusinesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow, no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\n1.2\t100RC Network Collaborations\nThe Rotterdam 100RC Water Exchange held in October 2015 focused on the complex intersection of climate change, aging infrastructure, flood management, urban development, and social connectivity combined with the diverse perspectives brought by participating CROs from nine cities. This offered a rich learning experience for Surat.\nOver five days in Mexico City in November 2015, Surat had a chance to collaborate with other cities and, by shaping and sharing its own learning, came to a better understanding of resilience. Surat learnt about real-world resilience challenges and solutions by visiting \u2018Living Laboratories\u2019. It catalyzed enthusiasm and commitment among CROs.\nThe Second International Symposium for Resilient Communities in Koriyama, Japan, was co-organized in April 2016 by the Institute for Resilient Communities and the Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute. It brought together scientists, engineers, public health experts, educators, policy makers, and others to collaborate on building resilient communities. Surat educated itself about interdisciplinary research programs to address critical issues in resilience, and learned how to engage with various public activities to foster interactions between experts and communities.\nThe urban infrastructure of Asian cities faces social, political, environmental, and financial risks due to climate change induced shocks and stresses. This creates the impetus for city stakeholders to assess their cities\u2019 vulnerabilities and to look for investment opportunities in designing and building resilient urban infrastructure. Training on Urban Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience is aimed at improving climate change and urban resilience knowledge among the SMC\u2019s senior level managers and to help them design projects. This training in Singapore was organized by Cities Development Initiatives of Asia in May 2016, under its Cities and Climate Change Training Series.\nThe July 2016 Singapore Regional Summit was designed to achieve objectives built on the experience of earlier summits and best practices. It built and strengthened relationships among CROs, Resilience Team Members, and partners to better leverage the network of practitioners. It increased the City Resilience Team\u2019s capacity to work around problem definitions and city actions. It fostered a regional cohort by bringing to the fore regional priorities to help advance collective action.\nThe Smart Cities Innovative Summit Asia Conference in South Korea was organized in September 2016. It provided the Surat CRO an opportunity to discuss Smart City plans with many Smart City Leaders of other Asian countries. The \u2018leadership of management\u2019 and \u2018policy issues for 4th revolution and ICT business\u2019 were also deliberated along with the Smart City initiation agenda of budgeting, funding, challenges, management, and cooperation.\n2.1 Stakeholder Engagement\nThe strategy development process was started by identifying and engaging with relevant stakeholders and city champions under the aegis of the city administration. Seven discovery groups were formed, comprising decision makers, planners, municipal engineers, academicians, researchers, entrepreneurs\/businessmen, builders\u2019 associations, water resource managers, public health practitioners, and energy\/ gas suppliers.\nSurat is considered a model city for good governance as well as for providing effective service delivery in comparison with many other Indian cities. Surat also has the advantages of efficient city administration, strong political consensus, and sufficient municipal finances.\nIn the past, the city has demonstrated its capacity to build resilience by improving the quality of its lifeline services such as disaster management, water supply, sewerage, solid waste disposal, and health. The mission of the city is to strengthen its infrastructure, withstand future shocks and stresses, build redundancies, and improve resilience. The SMC has improved its capacity to deal with shocks and stresses, and has taken up proactive initiatives in urban development, community health, and disaster management, working closely with industry and citizens. Inputs from multistakeholder groups led by the SMC can not only address various issues at city level but also influence policy at state and central levels. Therefore, any progress in this city will be keenly observed and can act as an example for urban resilience in other Indian cities, including the 100RC cities.\nInnovative methods and tools were used in the strategy development process. Some of the key highlights of the process are:\n\u25a0\tConsultations with policy makers and decision makers at the city\/municipal administration.\n\u25a0\tShared learning dialogues (SLDs) with enforcement authorities, such as city\/district police administration and Surat range police administration.\n\u25a0\tKey informant interviews (KlIs) with state-level government departments and institutions.\n\u25a0\tMeetings with elected members of city-, state-, and national-level political systems.\n\u25a0\tFocus group discussions (FGDs) with city steering committee members and discovery group members.\n\u25a0\tConsultations with subject matter specialists.\n\u25a0\tConduct of time-bound research studies to understand different aspects of the current situation and obtain information from secondary literature and primary surveys.\n\u25a0\tEngagement with a new generation of planners\/engineers\/ researchers via the Urban Transport and Infrastructure Design (UTID) Studio (with transport planning students).\n\u25a0\tParticipation in community engagement events to capture the perceptions of citizens.\nThe supporting images show an array of activities, including academic activities, community level activities and academic engagements as part of 100RC Surat, experts\u2019 participatory exercises in chart-based activities for cross discovery analysis, and voting excercise with the Android application.\n2.2\tResilience Orientation\nInitiatives within this resilience strategy are oriented around one of four categories, as shown in Figure 2.2.\nTransdisciplinary research on resilience issues in complex urban systems will generate knowledge in relation to the seven pillars. Research is a continuous process and will require constant engagement with institutions and stakeholders. Awareness plays a significant role in achieving the aim of resilience strategy. Some amount of awareness has already been created by engaging stakeholders on the key shocks and stresses. Enforcement also plays a very important role in implementing rules and regulations especially in traffic and pollution management which is now taken care by various agencies. Agencies uses advanced technology for law enforcement such as surveillance cameras to monitor traffic at various locations across the city.Some of the long term initiatives are aligned towards physical infrastructure development which needs implementation support from urban local body.\nResilience Synergy\nSynergy was established between national- and state-level policies, and programs; projects and institutions were linked to incorporate the lessons.Efforts were made to ensure that the resilience goals and initiatives identified aligned with various national- and state-level policies, programs, and projects. The current resilience strategy includes plans to inform and influence national- and state-level stakeholders by sharing lessons learned from city resilience interventions. There is a\nneed to enhance networking and sharing of experiences to ensure resilience-informed policies at local and state levels.\nResilience Demonstration\nThe resilience strategy adopts a multiscalar approach to address various resilience issues. The interventions aim to improve multistakeholder participation, and empower citizens to take informed decisions post strategy development. It is necessary to test these concepts through small pilot projects and research studies to ensure their effectiveness while replicating them across the city. These concepts can be built on the existing mechanisms and help in providing timely information.\nResilience Timeline\nResilience goals and initiatives introduced through the Surat resilience strategy are categorized based on the time required for successful implementation. Short-term interventions are initiatives which may span from one to two years (2016-2018) and medium-term interventions are initiatives which may span from one to five years (2016-2020). Long-term initiatives may require longer time (2016-2025), more resources (financial and human), and may require considerable political and administrative will for execution.\nResilience Incubation\nDuring the strategy development process, various institutions and organizations were identified as resilience incubators. These institutions will be custodians of knowledge, technology, and experience. Data\/information collected during various phases of the resilience-building exercise can be stored in these institutions to ensure access over time, leading to continued sustainability of the efforts. These institutions and organizations were brought on-board from the begining.\nBouquet of Initiatives\nResilience is a multisectoral process. It requires cross-sector links to develop a robust strategy with implementable actions. Surat\u2019s resilience strategy is aimed at generating multi- and cross-sectoral information which can broaden the scope of planning and designing initiatives. The development of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) can be the next logical step for the city government to access financial resources apart from the state or national government. To facilitate that process, several studies and research for informing DPRs have been identified and highlighted.\no\n3.1 Resilience Pillars, Goals, and Initiatives\nThe Surat resilience strategy has been developed around seven strategic pillars, 20 goals, and 63 initiatives\/actions. This section\nincludes the initiatives that Surat will further develop and implement between 2016 and 2025. Each pillar is defined by a number of\ngoals and associated initiatives. Figure 3.1 shows the resilience pillars and their orientation; Figure 3.2 shows the resilience pillars, goals, and initiatives in Surat's strategy.\no\n3.2\tStrategy Linkages Pillar Initiative Linkages\nThe Surat resilience strategy identifies seven pillars (discovery areas), 20 goals, and 63 initiatives\u2014the lattermost will create a resilient impact on all the pillars, thus increasing their resilient value.\nEleven initiatives were identified around Connectivity and Mobility. These initiatives were more targeted towards shared mobility, public transport, nonmotorized transport (NMT) solutions for traffic hotspots, traffic awareness and education. During expert group discussions, these initiatives were prioritized by committee members and subject experts. Later, these initiatives were investigated with other pillarstocheckthe interdependencies between resilience issues, using various impact scenarios. The results indicate that connectivity and mobility centric initiatives have higher levels of interdependencies with other initiatives in the areas of Environment and Ecosystem, Public Health, and Social Cohesion. As public transport forms the backbone of any efficient urban mobility system, adequate public transportation will contribute to the other ongoing environment friendly and safety initiatives. Currently the city administration is increasing the number of public buses and also planning to develop new and alternate modes including BRTS and Metro Rail system.\nSeven initiatives were identified around Affordable Housing. These were focused on housing demand and supply assessment, availability of financial aids for affordable housing, identification of affordable localities in the city and neighborhoods, and green infrastructure. The results indicate that the initiatives of affordable housing have higher levels of interdependencies with other initiatives in the areas of Employment and Economic Dependency and Social Cohesion. In the case of affordable housing in Surat, key industrial nodes can serve as workplace hubs, where similar income groups can live together in a cohesive social environment.\nThirteen initiatives were identified to address Water Availability and Quality. These were focused towards innovative infrastructure for better management of water supply, aiming for zero water waste, and conservation of rainwater and groundwater resources. The identified initiatives of the water sector have higher levels of interdependency with initiatives in the area of Ecosystem and Environment and Employment and Economic Dependency pillars. The textile industry also contributes much to the city\u2019s economy and employment. Solutions\no\nto these key environmental issues, therefore, will ensure that the city and its economy grow in an environmentally sustainable manner.\nFive initiatives were identified under Employment and Economic Dependency. These are targeted towards developing alternative employment opportunities in new and emerging sectors such as information technology, shipping and technical skill development programs in addition to financial aid to encourage entrepreneurship. The majority of textile industries rely heavily on local roads and regional transport networks (rail and road) to procure raw materials and to export processed products.\nFourteen initiatives were identified around Environment and Ecosystem. These initiatives are more focused on environmental regulations and policies, new infrastructure interventions for natural resource conservation, energy efficiency, and community-level awareness for environmental conservation. These initiatives will have positive impacts on Water Availability and Quality, Economy, Public Health, and Affordable Housing. Discussions with expert committee members highlighted the fact that the initiatives this pillar have a higher level of interdependencies with initiatives of Water Availability and Quality, Public Health, and Employment and Economic Dependency. Therefore, the indicators of water and health require continuous monitoring in the city due to the geo-climatic location and due to historical flood and plague events.\nTen initiatives were identified around Social Cohesion. These are inclined towards encouraging public participation at the community level and cooperation with the government by developing community-level activities. Such programs and community spaces will help create a better, livable environment and encourage cultural conservation which will, in turn, enhance the local identity of the city. The results indicate that the initiatives of Environment and Ecosystem have higher levels of interdependency with the pillars of Connectivity and Mobility, Environment and Ecosystem, and Public Health.\nThree initiatives were identified under Public Health. These are focused towards skill development, which will increase the availability of general health care facilities and make it affordable. The initiatives under this pillar are also inclined towards urban climate-health challenges to create a healthy, livable urban ecosystem in Surat. The city needs more affordable and general health care, especially during disaster-like situations.\nU-Turn Event\nU-Turn is an initiative of Surat City Police supported by Surat Municipal Corporation to bring out joy & creativity in our lives at a community level. Here, at U-Turn people gather, do exercise, create street paintings, play games and much more. It gives a platform for the urban communities to participate, communicate, and spread awareness about various social, environmental and cultural issues.\nBACKGROUND\nSurat is one of the fastest growing cities in India. In the last few years, with changing lifestyles, the number of vehicles has grown tremendously in the city. As per recent reports, the number of registered vehicles in the city is more than 2.6 million, and this includes all categories of vehicles (TOI, 2016). A drastic shift is evident: people are moving from nonmotorized to motorized transport and from two-wheelers to four-wheelers. Comprising more than 70 percent of the total number, two-wheelers take the maximum share, while cars constitute more than 9 percent of the vehicles. In 2015, the city had 2.18 million vehicles plying on the roads, of which 1.7 million were two-wheelers and 0.26 million cars. This means that for every two residents in the city, there is one vehicle (TOI, 2016).\nCoupled with high growth of private vehicles, an inefficient public transport system, inadequate parking facilities, and lack of pedestrian facilities, encroachments on footpaths and road margins, informal activities, and small-time business activities along the major corridors have increased traffic congestion in the city.\nAbsence of public transport for over a decade has led to para-transits, especially auto-rickshaws, emerging as a major public transport provider, as well as an increase in individual modes of transport. Para-transits, apart from being illegal, add to problems such as unorganized operations, overloading, poor services, pollution, overcharging, and restricted service hours.\nEven though there is an increase in the number of private vehicles in the city, there is not much improvement in traffic behavior. A lack of traffic sense and awareness leads to issues of traffic management. The people of Surat have a bad reputation for being rash and careless drivers. An increase in the number of nonlicensed drivers has also been observed in the city.\nTo build resilience, the city needs to implement an efficient traffic management system and move towards ensuring an adequate public transport system. Several research studies are necessary to identify the scale of interventions required. These include increasing public parking and pedestrian facilities, improving junctions and rail crossings, and provisioning traffic signals and lane separators to segregate traffic. An effective enforcement mechanism by the traffic police is also necessary to enforce smooth traffic flow in the city.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGES\nPublic Transport: Public transport is one of the concerns highlighted by a majority of the stakeholders. There is less public transport than what is needed, the service frequency is low, and it covers limited areas only. Further, a majority of the population find it difficult to use it due to limited signage and poor comfort levels.\nIllegal Parking: Surat has commercial areas and markets situated in the center of the city. Access to these places is through narrow lanes, and there are no authorized parking facilities. Even major roads with high attraction points lack parking facilities. This leads to people parking their vehicles under bridges, footpaths, and on the sides of main roads, leading to reduced space for vehicular traffic and increased traffic congestions.\nFootpath Encroachment: Encroached pedestrian lanes on both sides ofthe roads decrease free movement of pedestrians and compromises on safety. Lanes and footpaths are usually occupied illegally by vendors or vehicles parked along the roadside. Currently, only limited residential and commercial areas have clearly demarcated pedestrian lanes or footpaths. Footpaths in some of the newly developed areas, like Gaurav Path (in Piplod) and University Road (in Vesu), are occupied by mobile food joints, which attract citizens for recreational activities.\nHigh Number of Rickshaws & Private Vehicles: Lack of public transport has led to increased numbers of private transport providers and private vehicles.\nAirport Connectivity: The city has one domestic airport. The current frequency of flights is limited and caters to only two destinations\u2014Delhi and Mumbai. Such limited connectivity has an adverse impact on trade and mobility.\nIndustrial Logistics: Industrial units located within the city operate in a congested environment. Lack of proper roads and reduced carriage width due to roadside parking contribute to existing traffic problems. There is a need to develop a detailed logistics plan for these industries.\no\nAccessibility to public transport is the key challenge within the city. The city needs to assess accessibility to its public transport facilities and highlight the areas which need improvement. To achieve this, a detailed Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL)\u2014which takes into consideration average walking speed and time, distances to public transport stops, and peak-hour route frequencies of different modes of public transport\u2014is needed. Geographic Information System (GIS) based mapping tools can be used to generate a visual representation for strategic future transport planning.\nOWNERS\n\u25a0\tTraffic Cell, Surat Municipal Corporation\n\u25a0\tBRTS Cell, Surat Municipal Corporation\nSUPPORTERS\n\u25a0\tCivil Engineering Department, Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology\n\u25a0\tFaculty of Technology, Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology University\n\u25a0\tTraffic Department, Surat City Police\n\u25a0\tSurat Climate Change Trust\n\u25a0\t100 Resilient Cities Program\nALIGNMENT\n\u25a0\tGujarat State Road Policy - 2015 (Special emphasis is given to Road Safety Research in Policy Statement X)\n\u25a0\tDevelopment Plan (DP), 2035\n\u25a0\tSurat Smart City Program\n\u25a0\tBus Rapid Transit System Project\n\u25a0\tSurat Metro Rail Project\nSpatial and statistical analysis of road accidents\nTo access and map major road accident hotspots in Surat\nBRIEF\nThe city will conduct a detailed road accident study, which will be aimed at identifying existing hotspots for accidents. It will also highlight areas where road safety issues are persistent issues. The research study will use images from more than 600 surveillance cameras installed by city police and will use GIS based spatial analysis tools to assess vehicle movements, traffic patterns, road safety issues, and resulting accidents. The study will be highly useful for Suraksha Setu (Safe City Project) of Surat. This research will help the Surat City Police department in identifying hotspots and also address the problem at its roots by linking it with their ongoing awareness initiatives.\nOWNERS\n\u25a0\tTraffic Cell, Surat Municipal Corporation\n\u25a0\tTraffic Department, Surat City Police\nSUPPORTERS\n\u25a0\tCivil Engineering Department, Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology\n\u25a0\tCollege of Architecture, Sarvajanik College of Engineering & Technology\n\u25a0\tSurat Climate Change Trust\n\u25a0\tSurat Traffic Education Trust\nALIGNMENT\n\u25a0\tGujarat State Road Policy - 2015 (Special emphasis is given to Road Safety Research in Policy Statement X)\n\u25a0\tSurat Smart City Program\n\u25a0\tSuraksha Setu (Safe City Project) of Surat Traffic Police\nRoad safety audit\nOBJECTIVE To carry out road audit to find engineering and I design issues for better traffic management ; and safety of citizens in Surat City\nBRIEF\nThe city will conduct detailed road safety audits at critical junctions for on-site assessment of the shortcomings in road and traffic control systems that lead to unsafe travel.

The city has also expanded over time (major expansion happened in 2006); it currently covers an area of around 326 sq. km. The population of the city in 2011 was 4,466,826 (Census of India). The actual population may exceed these figures, especially because of rapid development in the Surat metropolitan region.\nThe decadal growth of the city\u2019s population was at its maximum from 1931 to 1941. For two decades following this period, the city showed a decrease in the decadal growth. From 1961, a positive trend continued till 1991 before declining again from 1991 to 2001. Surat has seen an unprecedented growth in the last four decades, recording one of the highest growth rates in the country and a 10-fold population rise. The city now ranks as the eighth largest city in the country. Coupled with this, a spillover of population into the periphery has also been observed.\nSimilar to other urban cities in India, Surat has its own share of slums. The slums have mostly migrant populations who are unable to afford formal housing. As per the 2001 Census, about 307 slums, with a population of 0.49 million, existed in Surat. The number of slums has since gone up to 773 (Census of India, 2011) with the expansion in the city\u2019s limit in 2006. Many of these slums are located along the tidal creeks, between river embankments and other drainage lines. These slums face a higher risk of flooding (pluvial, fluvial, and tidal). Having recognized this, efforts to relocate the slums were initiated by the government under various schemes\u2014mainly during the last decade under various national projects including the Jawarharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), and Gujarat Rural Urban Housing (GRUH)\u2014more than 30,000 permanent houses were provided at safer locations to slum dwellers. In 2001, according to Census figures, 20 percent of Surat\u2019s population lived in slums. Census 2011 showed a reduction of 10 percent due to continuous improvement efforts by government schemes. Slum dwellers and citizens falling in the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society are eligible to avail ready-built houses on plots of land away from the existing slums, in a hygienic environment.\nWith an increase in the city limit and development of new zones, a boom has been observed in the real estate market. This has increased the land values in some areas, making it unaffordable for all classes. This has caused a gap between demand and supply, leaving about 90 percent of houses in the newly developed areas unoccupied.\nBuilt House Approach: The SMC has implemented several housing projects under the government\u2019s housing schemes for urban poor. Also, slum dwellers living at the intersection of roads and other inappropriate locations have been shifted to the houses built under the housing schemes. The built house approach for the rehabilitation of slum dwellers and urban poor is carried out under the following five categories:\n\u25a0\tEWS Housing\n\u25a0\tVAM BAY Hosuing\n\u25a0\tLIG Housing\n\u25a0\tMukhya Mantri Gruh Yojana\n\u25a0\tPradhan Mantri Avas Yojna\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGES\nLess Rental Housing: Rental housing can be a logical solution for meeting affordable housing needs of a city that has a large migrant population. Rental housing should be promoted as a temporary solution for housing, since vacant housing is not affordable.\nLack of Involvement of Private Sector for Affordable Housing: There are no formal policies to involve the private sector for affordable housing. As an ULB, the SMC has the freedom to adopt a model in which the city can benefit from its strong private sector, especially for affordable housing.\nAffordable Criteria for EWS, and for LIG, MIG, and HIG (Low-, Middle-, and High-Income Groups: Affordable housing can be delivered by taking into consideration criteria such as cost-effective materials, optimum use of carpet area, and affordable land availability for the housing schemes. Affordable housing can be achieved by providing certain subsidies or tax deduction on material or land.\nDisparity in Demand and Current SUDA plan: As a part of discovery area diagnosis, the SUDA\u2019s plan needs to be reviewed to see how it provides for the affordable housing sector. Surat has growth in population and the area of the city has also grown simultaneously. The study can show projections for demand keeping in view criteria such as population growth, city expansion, affordability, and economic growth as well.\nSpatial Distribution: Spatial distribution of LIG\/MIG\/HIG needs to be ensured, based on the affordability of the amenities\/utilities. For example, the Vesu area has a certain lifestyle and cost of living which is suitable for HIG housing. Planning LIG or MIG in this area will not serve the idea of affordability, resulting in vacant housing and unserved need of housing facilities. Housing for all requires the right distribution, based on affordability of a locality for consumers in terms of day-to-day utilities.\n....................

Tapi, a perennial river, is a major source of water supply. The network of piped water supply was started in 1898. The city has been investing in water supply systems for over a century, on account of which it has a well-managed water supply system now. In 2015, the average water supply was 980 million liters per day (MLD), which included demand from domestic, industrial, commercial, and institutional consumers.\nIn the recent past, it has been observed that the river water quality is deteriorating. Causes contributing to the pollution of the river water are sometimes beyond the control of the SMC, as they are outside the city boundary. Hence, options for finding alternate sources of water\u2014such as getting water from Kakrapar weir by pipeline\u2014are being worked out. In such an eventuality, both quality and quantity issues will be a big challenge for Surat. Currently, water supply is intermittent, with an average duration of three hours per day. About 95 percent of the complaints related to water supply are being solved by the SMC.\nTo meet the rising population demands of water over the next two decades, the SMC has envisaged various water supply infrastructure projects. Water supply schemes were supported by the national and state governments between 2010 and 2015. During this period, various water supply projects were sanctioned under the JNNURM scheme for the newly-merged Eastern area of the city. In January 2013, a 90-MLD capacity fully-automatic water treatment plant with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) was commissioned at Kosad Water Works. In 2014-15, a pilot project of 24x7 water supply scheme for the New North area and New Southeast area were commissioned with a total project cost of Rs. 34.54 crore.\nBy fast-tracking the implementation of projects, the SMC has achieved 30 percent increase in water supply, from 750 MLD in 2010 to 980 MLD in 2015. The SMC is now poised to achieve the goal of 100 percent coverage of extended area and population by 2016.\nCurrently, river Tapi is the main source of water supply in Surat. Droughts and late onset of monsoon are already creating stress on Surat\u2019s water supply system during peak summers. For meeting the demand of a population pegged at more than 8 million in 2020, at least 1,200 to 1,500 MLD water is required. Apart from domestic use, additional water will be needed for industries in Hazira.\nWith tremendous increase in the population within city limits, there is likely to be an obvious increase in the water demand. The city has the capacity to store for approximately three months only, in case of any drought or natural calamity, which highlights the need for reuse of water in the city. Lack of water conservation practices may lead to a crisis in the near future in the absence of the present water source, Tapi. Taking the effects of climate changes into account, good\nwater conservation methods need to be planned. The city is reusing a negligible amount of water, about only 8 percent. Salt water intrusion is another big problem for the city due to its proximity to the Arabian Sea. This situation may increase the competition over limited resources currently allocated for irrigation and power generation. Water scarcity will become an issue, unless major changes in allocating Ukai dam water takes place.\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGES\nWater Quality: Being close to the Arabian Sea, and more than 40 percent of the city lying in low elevation coastal zones, tidal action and subsequent salt water intrusion is one of the key challenges the city faces.\nWater Conservation: While the existing water quality is good in Surat due to water availability from Ukai dam, the citizens do not follow proper water conservation and management approaches. River and groundwater pollution needs to be monitored in the city. There is a need for regulations such as incorporation of rainwater harvesting as a part of building bylaws and also for raising awareness among citizens on conservation and limiting wastage of water.\nTertiary Treatment Plan - Surat: Treatment methods vary for different types of wastewater. For example, different sets of microbes will be required for treating different wastes. However, in Surat, this is not done currently. The city is reusing only 8 percent of waste water for industrial purposes.\nDemand Assessment: Conflicting demand from various sectors such as resideConflicting demand from various sectors such as residential, industrial, irrigation, natural\/ ecological cycles require assessment. Domestic water demand is something which will unquestionably increase in the future as the population increases. Town planning and engineering techniques are very important in this sector since they also play a crucial role in groundwater availability and recharge over long term. Keeping soil moisture and water table in mind, design aspects should be adapted in such a way that the water table gets recharged.\nIncreasing Pollution and River Tapi Depletion: Primarily untreated sewage from upstream settlements along with industrial effluents has led to high water pollution. Industrial pollution does not have major impact on Tapi river but it has impact on various creeks leading to Mindhola river. Surat, also called mini India, celebrates many different festivals which also cause river pollution and increase biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels in the river. Issues of water siltation and untreated effluents are likely to impact the quality of river water. In addition, groundwater pollution has been recorded in many areas of the city. Thus there is a need for environmental management of the river and the results should be shared with the public to initiate collective actions. The city encounters many water-borne diseases which need to be checked.\n.....................

As per the Mayor\u2019s foundation report, Surat is the fourth fastest growing city globally, with a decadal growth of 55 percent to 60 percent in the last four decades. The GDP rate is 11.5 percent. Among the highest income tax paying cities in Asia in 2010-11, Surat contributed Rs. 22,000 million to the national exchequer. It has the highest average annual household income and has practically zero percent unemployment.\nCrisil and ICRA have graded Surat at the top of the list as an urban civic body on operating and financial efficiency. The city has a very vibrant economy. It is the hub of the diamond and textile industries.\nThe current economy of Surat is dominated by diamond cutting, textiles, gold thread making, dyeing, and printing industries that cater to both domestic markets and exports. Diamond cutting and polishing, however, mainly cater to the export market. The medium- and large-scale industries are mostly located in the five industrial estates in and around the city. The city accounts for:\n\u25a0\t90 percent of the world\u2019s total rough diamond cutting and polishing;\n\u25a0\t99.99 percent of the nation\u2019s total rough diamond cutting and polishing;\n\u25a0\t90 percent of the nation\u2019s total diamond exports;\n\u25a0\t60 percent of the nation\u2019s total man-made fabric production;\n\u25a0\t28 percent of the nation\u2019s total manmade fiber production;\n\u25a0\t18 percent of the nation\u2019s total man-made fiber export;\n\u25a0\t12 percent of the nation\u2019s total fabric production; and\n\u25a0\t14 percent of the nation\u2019s total foreign exchange.\nAlong with textiles and diamonds, other sectors in the city include petroleum, oil and gas, shipping, cement, metallurgy, paper, chemical, fertilizer, etc. Hazira INA, Magadalla, Ichchhapore, and Olpad near Surat have giant industries, such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, Gas Authority of India Limited, ABG Shipyard, Narmada Cement, Ambuja Cement, Ultratech Cement, NTPC-KGPP Power Plant, ESSAR group of Industries (steel\/power\/chemical\/oil\/shipping), Larsen & Toubro, and Reliance Industries. Microsoft\u2019s CityNext initiative has tied up with information technology (IT) services majors, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, to leverage technology for the sustainable growth of cities in India. The first smart IT city in India is being constituted by the Microsoft CityNext Initiative in Surat, Gujarat.\nIn general, Surat\u2019s industrial system is a complex blend of home-based, small-scale, and medium-scale industries largely dependent on semi-skilled and unskilled labor. In-migration from other states is encouraged to meet the\ndemands of labor in these industries.\nIf looked through the resilience lens, the economy of Surat is heavily dependent on two dominant sectors, diamond and textile. These two income generators are dependent on global markets and economy. Recession in these two sectors has a significant impact on the economy of the city. Thus, the city should invite different alternative industrial sectors, such as technology, automobile, tourism, food industry, etc., as backup livelihood providers in case of economic crisis. In addition, there is no comprehensive and organized framework for skill upgradation in the city.\nRESILIENCE CHALLANGES\nAccess to Finance: The economy of the city is strong, but there are also issues like income disparity. Small-scale industries and businesses need easy access to finances such as soft loans at low interest rates, subsidies, insurances, etc.\nMonochrome Livelihood Opportunities: Since the diamond and textile industries are the two major employers in the city, there is limited diversity of opportunity. Lack of resilience prevails in the economy. The city needs to provide a platform to make the existing sectors stronger and sustainable, besides providing space for new sectors to grow.\nUnregulated Industries: The city has a large number of industries clustered in specific locations. Much of the activities in these areas go unregulated due to limited access and policing. Industrial safety norms and environmental policies should be enforced strictly through regular audits and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) activities.\nEducation Level and Lack of Skill Training: There are many educational institutions within the city. Unfortunately, they lack in quality of education and skill development programs.\n....................Initiative 4.1.1..................\nPromote and support innovative business\nopportunities using information,\ncommunication, and technology\nI To promote innovative and diversified\nOBJECTIVE\t.\t...\t. f .\neconomic enterprises which can create future business opportunities in the city with the help of information communication technology (ICT).\n........................BRIEF.........................\nThe ICT industry has witnessed excellent growth in the past two decades in Gujarat. Investor\/business-friendly IT policies, which would encourage both local entrepreneurs and foreign direct investments (FDI) will be developed. This will lead to Surat becoming one of the favorite destinations for ICT investment. E-commerce and e-business will also be developed. As a major output, it will provide alternate business environment in addition to textiles and diamond polishing.\nOWNERS\n\u25a0\tDistrict Industries Center\n\u25a0\tDeputy Director, Department of Labour and Employment\n\u25a0\tIndividual or Business Groups\nSUPPORTERS\n\u25a0\tUrban Community Development Center, Surat Municipal Corporation\n\u25a0\tThe Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry\n\u25a0\tEconomics Department, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University\nALIGNMENT\n\u25a0\tMake in India Initiative, Govt, of India\n\u25a0\tThe National Skill Development Mission, 2015 of Govt, of India\n\u25a0\tGujarat Skill Development Mission of Department of Labour and Employment, Government of Gujarat\n\u25a0\tVibrant Gujarat 2017: Focus Sector: Skill Development\n......................Initiative 4.1.2...................\nMicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises\nOBJECTIVE T\u00b0 Prom\u00b0te and support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in Surat.\n.........................BRIEF......................\nThe micro, small, and medium enterprises sector has emerged as a highly vibrant and dynamic sector.

Industrial growth, and high population growth and density place pressure on the ecosystem of Surat. The two important tasks to be attended in Surat are: implementation of environmental policies such as Coastal Regulation Zones; and enforcement of laws in industrial areas. There is a need for more green spaces to be developed and maintained. The Tapi is depleting due to rapid siltation and development activities taking place along both sides ofthe river. Pollution level checks should be carried out on a regular\/frequent basis. The environmental cell should be active and efficient in monitoring air, sound, land, and water pollution throughout the city.\nWater and Sewerage: River Tapi is one of the major sources of water available to Surat. This has led to the discharge of domestic used water and sewage from peri-urban areas into the river. Pollution, including disposal of sewage and industrial effluents, and reservoir impoundment vegetation, has led to growth of algae, underwater hydrilla, and water hyacinth. Reuse of water is negligible, with only 2 percent of water being reused in the city. Water conservation practices are lacking in the city. A reduction in the water table and groundwater pollution are noticed in many areas.\nSolid Waste: The SMC currently manages about 1750 MT of solid waste per day. Around 98 percent off total solid waste generated is disposed of effectively through well-established sanitary landfills, centralized bio-medical waste collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal facilities. These landfill and dumping sites are a problem and account for greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, efforts are required to segregate and reuse the waste. The initiative for solid waste management (SWM) initiatives, with regard to the new Management of Solid Waste (MSW) Rules, 2015, are to be mandated in the city.\nAir Quality: Vehicular pollution accounts for 60-70 percent of the total pollution load of the city. The main causes are two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, and multi-axle vehicles. According to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Surat is one of the cities which does not maintain the required air quality standards, since more than the permissible amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) has been recorded in the city (2004-05). Efforts, such as Compressed Natural Gas conversions in vehicles, and BRTS and Mobile Pollution Measuring Vans, have helped in reducing the SPM levels but not in reducing the greenhouse gas contribution.\nRESILIENCE CHALLANGES\nCreek Flood: There is no storage or control mechanism in or around the tidal creeks in the city. Development along the creeks and poor maintenance of creek banks have led to siltation and degradation of water quality. Further, pollutants discharged from untreated and unregulated industries worsen the situation. The growth of vegetation and subsequent reduction in the drain areas lead to frequent flooding in the creeks.\nExtreme Rainfall: Due to climate change, it is observed that the total rainfall may be reduced but the intensity of occurrence has and will continue to increase.\nIndustrial Accidents: Surat has a lot of industrial units, among which Olpad Cyanide Industrial Area and HNA are critical areas. They account for various accidents, and this needs to be addressed efficiently to avoid future risks. Also, Surat should not neglect the possible risk from Kakrapar Nuclear Power Plant situated on the banks of the river Tapi.\nSaltwater Intrusion: Illegal groundwater use has been noticed in the city. Unregulated groundwater use will eventually lead to salt water intrusion through the creeks and river into the ground.\nHeatwave: It has been observed that the duration of the summer season is elongated and irregular. Heat waves have been increasing with the changing climate. This leads to health issues and currently the citizens are not aware of the long-term effects of a heat wave.\nInsufficient Regulation: Lack of regulation and low law enforcement is a major cause of all environment- and ecosystem-related issues in Surat. This is a major issue in Surat, especially in industrial areas, leading to unregulated and untreated industrial discharge into the river and air pollution. One of the reasons for the depletion of rivers in the festive seasons is due to lack of regulation and enforcement.\nLack of Risk Awareness: Sensitivity of the citizens towards the environment is missing in the city. The citizens should be made aware of the consequences of their actions on the environment and thus take responsible steps.\n....................

Risk exists in Surat since reclaimed land in the sea can cause high tidal effects. Due to major industrial activities, fire incidents have also been noticed in the city. To monitor climate change trends and impacts and to integrate them with multihazard risk planning, the city will conduct regular GIS-based spatial analysis of vulnerability and risks to strengthen preparedness for future resilience. The city will also enhance its existing Early Warning System, which currently keeps Surat prepared to mitigate the flood risk. It can be linked with a high-end Emergency Operation Center (EOC) and mapping of new growth areas.\nOWNERS\n\u25a0\tSurat Climate Change Trust\nSUPPORTERS\n\u25a0\tEnvironment Cell, Surat Municipal Corporation\n\u25a0\tGujarat State Disaster Management Authority\n\u25a0\tSurat Urban Development Authority\n\u25a0\tHazira Notified Area, Surat\n\u25a0\tThe Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Surat\nALIGNMENT\n\u25a0\tState Disaster Act: Gujarat State\n\u25a0\tDistrict Disaster Management Plan\n\u25a0\tHazard Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, Gujarat\n\u25a0\tCity Disaster Management Plan\n\u25a0\tEarly Warning System Guidelines\n\u25a0\tAsian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network\n\u25a0\tUrban Flood Management Guidelines\n....................Initiative 5.1.2..................\nReview of environmental policies\n...................Initiative 5.1.3.................\nDevelopment of a pollution zoning atlas\nTo review existing environmental and industrial\nOBJECTIVE\npolices, and make an inventory or handbook for better enforcement and environmental regulations.\n..BRIEF....\nDue to its sensitive coastal environment, the rapid growth of Surat city demands the implementation of environmental policies, regulations, and guidelines.

The recent population growth of the city is mainly due to two main labor-intensive industries: textiles and diamond polishing. The spurt in the population is due to a combination of factors, mainly natural growth and in-migration. Surat claims to be a zero-unemployment city. This has attracted rural migrants from within the state (Saurashtra and arid northern parts) and other states (especially Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Orissa).\nSurat reflects the pace of Mumbai. In spite of a fast-paced life, social cohesion and mutual support are quite high among the Surtis (that is, people of Surat). Social networks are strong among most communities, especially those from the arid and semi-arid zones of Gujarat. Research has shown that higher social capacity indices are observed in middle and upper SECs compared to lower SECs and slum dwellers, which are dominated by a diverse immigrant population.\nFor a city that is under a constant risk of floods and other hydro-meteorological disasters, strong social capital is an asset. Therefore, strengthening social capacities, especially among migrants, will be necessary to enable people in lower SECs to build resilience through better coordination and mutual support.\nUnfortunately, the NGO and microfinance coverage in Surat is limited compared to many other Indian cities. Therefore, other avenues to build social cohesion have to be explored. .\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGES\nHigh Migration: Migration rate is growing every year and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the city administration to regulate this growth. This further increases the stress on the city\u2019s management, existing infrastructure, and crime rates. Increase in migration also leads to increase in the number of slums and engineered buildings to cater to the housing demand. This leads to inequality in society, thus affecting social cohesion.\nLacking Sense of Social Responsibility: With the increasing number of migrants, there is an underlying feeling among the local population that the sense of social responsibility (including contributing to city management, such as, keeping the city clean, following rules and regulations) has decreased over time. The city administration needs to bring back this feeling of belonging among the citizens.\nLoss of Local Culture: Surat is a major industrial hub, attracting people mainly for its economic opportunities. Increased demand for housing has also led to the demolition of heritage structures to give way to high-rise buildings. Surat is said to have lost its unique culture, since many different communities come together here for industrial activities.\nCrime and Law Enforcement: The city needs strong law enforcement to deal with problems such as encroachment of public spaces, traffic jams, accidents, and crime.\nHigh Property Rate: Surat has a very strong real estate sector providing housing and building structures for both residential and commercial purposes. The number of buildings in the city has grown several-fold in the past decade. Nevertheless, many of these buildings cater to the needs of middle income and high income communities, making it unaffordable for the low-income groups. A majority of home owners are people who have invested in more than one property, therefore leading to an artificial housing shortage. One of the concerns of the citizens is the increase in the number of vacant high income houses, but shortage in low and middle income houses.\n......................Initiative 6.1.1.....................\nResearch on social issue\nOBJECTIVE T\u00b0 develop a research profile\/portfolio on social issues and cohesion aspects by academic\/research institutions in city\n..........................BRIEF...............\nSocial institutions (research and academic) involved in social change will be facilitated.

Located in a nearly flat coastal terrain, Surat was once infamous for vector- and water-borne diseases. The seasonality of vector-borne diseases is likely to change, and the disease transmission period is likely to expand, due to increases in temperatures and changes in the humid seasons. Many health sector studies raise concerns on the changes in vector propagation and recommend conducting continued action research on climate and vector-borne diseases. This is especially important since this region is a malaria-endemic area and faces recurrent outbreaks of leptospirosis. Location, climate, and socio-demographic structure, coupled with the developmental activities of the city, are high risk factors for the breeding of vectors, as well as their ability to survive and spread infections.\nLocated on riverbanks and close to the sea, Surat has a number of water pools which are breeding sites for mosquitoes. Climate change, increasing population, high in-migration, change in land use, and inaccessible services such as water supply, sewerage, and solid waste create an environment that could lead to an increase in vector-borne diseases.\nThe SMC is aware of the situation and is already putting in place clean city initiatives, including monsoon preparedness to avoid problems. Surat is also known for its knowledge and experience in managing malaria cases. Various health sector studies have highlighted the near-extinction of filarial diseases due to the extension of underground sewerage across the city, which shows that the efforts of the ULB have worked. Similarly, malaria is under control due to a strong citywide monitoring system, which includes urban health centers. Mosquito vector control measures, such as door-to=door monitoring to prevent breeding, a system of fines\/ penalties, and fogging further reduce the chances of the disease occurring.\nRESILIENCE ISSUES\nHigh Cost Medical Services: There are many government and private health care centers, but the critical medical services are very expensive and therefore less accessible to low income populations. Increase in the quality of medical services for these segments is needed.\n....................Initiative 7.1.1.................\nCenter of excellence for urban health & climate resilience\nTo establish a Center of Excellence (COE) for Urban Health and Climate Change, which will conduct actionable research for urban health and climate change trends.\n..BRIEF.........................\nSurat has an Urban Health and Climate Resilience Center (UHCRC), which has been participating actively in urban health issues and research. This initiative should be sustained, and the UHCRC developed as a Center of Excellence with support from academic partners. The scope of actionable research for the COE will cover integrated emergency medical care network, skill training modules, climate change and urban health, noncommunicable diseases including malnutrition, food safety and security, equity-focused urban health care services, climate and health, coastal city vulnerability assessment and adaptation plans, and creating a child-friendly resilient city.\nOWNERS\n\u25a0\tHealth Department, Surat Municipal Corporation\n\u25a0\tUrban Health and Climate Resilience Center\nSUPPORTERS\n\u25a0\tSurat Climate Change Trust\n\u25a0\tSurat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research\nALIGNMENT\n\u25a0\tHealth Department of Surat Municipal Corporation\n\u25a0\tUrban Health and Climate Resilience Center\n....................Initiative 7.1.2.................\nUrban health climate observatory\nOBJECTIVE T\u00b0 develop urban health and climate change information systems to monitor health care scenarios and climate trends.\n.......................BRIEF.........................\nThe city will develop an urban health and climate information system, with real-time data, under the urban health climate observatory. This is an evidence-based health management system and services for sustained climate science research program that improves capacity, communication, and societal understanding, thus helping to reduce morbidity and mortality due to extreme climatic conditions. The system will provide Surat city-specific real-time climate data and impact indicators to support the health sector infrastructure operating in the city. The system will be technology-supported; it will have updated information and alerts. It can be developed and managed by an external technical expert unit.\nOWNERS\n\u25a0\tHealth Department, Surat Municipal Corporation\n\u25a0\tUrban Health and Climate Resilience Center\nSUPPORTERS\n\u25a0\tSurat Climate Change Trust\n\u25a0\tSurat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research\nALIGNMENT\n\u25a0\tExisting efforts of Health Department of Surat Municipal Corporation\n......................Initiative 7.1.3...................\nUrban health & climate resilience skill laboratory and promotion centre\nTo establish training and capacity building, set up under the Urban Health and Climate Change Promotional Center for skill development.\n.........................BRIEF...........\nThe Health and Climate Resilience Skill Laboratory will be a multistakeholder set-up for urban practitioners. The Centre will provide the formal and informal training programs. It will also serve as a health promotion center for community-level health awareness and education display (as a museum), for knowledge transfer, and awareness at institutional as well as community level. The Centre will also promote extensive education efforts and build outreach workers\u2019 capacity in the urban health sector. It will perform as community participation consortiums at different levels such as academicians, citizens, schools, urban agriculturists, to generate urban health awareness.\nOWNERS\n\u25a0\tHealth Department, Surat Municipal Corporation\n\u25a0\tUrban Health and Climate Resilience Center\nSUPPORTERS\n\u25a0\tSurat Climate Change Trust\n\u25a0\tSurat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research\nALIGNMENT\n\u25a0\tExisting efforts of Health Department of Surat Municipal Corporation\nWay Forward\nSurat, prima facie would work upon the prioritization of the initiatives. Based on time frame and priority, initiatives will be implemented in the city. Despite being financially more independent compared with many other cites, Surat still has to depend on State and Central finances for various developmental projects. To incorporate resilience in not only the existing but forthcoming city-level projects as well and to leverage funds, the resilience strategy suggests developing synergy with ongoing and planned programs. The prioritization of the initiatives would thus help in aligning with the State or Central on going policies. The resilience strategy includes plans to inform and influence State and National level stakeholders through sharing the lessons learned from the city resilience interventions.\nTherefore, developing a series of resilience informed, ready to use DPRs will be important for the city to access funds and other resources from various programs as and when the opportunities arise. These DPRs will empower the city to leverage resources for building resilience as well as develop capacities to appreciate resilience. Inputs from International and National platform and strategic partners and best practices will be useful for developing sector-specific DPRs. 100RC network has provided the cities, at large with refined, prestigious and excellent expertise platform partner and expert advisors to be associated with and helping the city connect with them. Identifying and approaching the platforms partners and expert advisors would be a next step further to help city implement its resilience initiatives with peer interested partners.\nCurrently, the city largely depends on National and State Government funding, apart from local sources. Surat has a wide spread economic sector, with which innovative ideas could be adopted to raise resources with public private holdings. Identifying the resources would align the city towards Spear Heading implementation of the resilience initiatives.\nThe best way forward is to align the city with the hierarchy of the initiatives with their importance and the level of implementation period while connecting it with the platform partners, advisors, identified funds and resources with local, state or central policies. As rightly said, now this is not the end; it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["Govt","Narmada","Dhaka","south Gujarat","Japan","Pune","Asia","Chennai","Mumbai","South Korea","Vadodara","River Tapi","Maharashtra","Orissa","Singapore","South Gujarat","Bombay","Delhi","Smart City","Mindhola","Hazira","Narmada River","Navsari","India","Gujarat","Surat City","Koriyama","Sabarmati","India Initiative","Surat Smart City","Surat City Location Surat","Athwalines","Arabian Sea","Bamroli","Tapi","San Francisco","Ahmedabad","Ambica","Gujarat Narmada","New North","Surat","Surat Surat","Mexico City","New Southeast","Magadalla","Bharuch","Accessible India","Ichchhapore","Saurashtra","Kolkata"],"PERSON":["MICHAEL BERKOWITZ","Pradhan Mantri Avas Yojana","Kamlesh Yagnik","Kakrapar","N.

Tidal flooding and flash floods, sanitation and waste management, congestion, and unemployment, among others, are the issues the city currently dealt with. About five percent of the city's population living in poverty is considered to be the most vulnerable to these problems. Therefore, a special attention is needed to this group of people.\nDuring this time, the Semarang city's government, together with all\nof the city elements, has tried to overcome these challenges, both\nthrough improved physical and non-physical infrastructures. The city\nhas achieved and accomplished a lot, however, there is still much left to be done. For this matter, Semarang does not rule out the possibility to learn from other cities, either in the national or international levels. Further, Semarang's participation in the 100 Resilient Cities network is expected to strengthen every effort the city makes in tackling these\nissues.\nThere are 6 pillar strategies, 18 strategies, and 53 initiatives listed in this City Resilience Strategy Document. The strategy was formulated through an inclusive process involving many elements of the city. It is hoped that the document becomes one of the guidelines in implementing the concrete actions towards the resilient Semarang. These actions will not only be done by the agencies within the city government, but also by the entire community of Semarang. In addition, through a network built in the 100 Resilient Cities, it is also expected that there are opportunities to cooperate with other parties related to resources in order to build the city resilience, nationally and internationally.\nA resilient city does not only mean as a city that can withstand the current challenges and adapt accordingly, but also as a city that can further develop better in the future. In this regard, all elements of the city have a significant role in creating the city resilience.\nTherefore, on this occasion I would like to invite all \u2018sedulur-sedulur\u2019 -brothers and sisters-- in Semarang to move together towards a resilient Semarang, with the ultimate goal of realizing the welfare of the whole society. As for the future, I hope that with this City Resilience Strategy Document, Semarang, along with all its challenges, can become a more resilient city and develop into a modern and sustainable city.\nLETTER FROM 100 RESILIENT CITIES\nPresident, 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation MICHAEL BERKOWITZ\nToday, 100 Resilient Cities is proud to partner with the city of\nSemarang to release their Resilience Strategy: Moving together\ntowards a Resilient Semarang. For over four centuries, Semarang has been the focal point of trade in Indonesia, and a destination for people from all different backgrounds in the region. It takes a bold and honest view of the wide variety of challenges and opportunities the city\nfaces, and brings together both existing and new resilience building\ninitiatives while honoring the diversity that is a key characteristic of\nSemarang. This strategy is the end result of a process that ensured\nparticipation from a broad range of stakeholders. This strategy truly\nreflects Semarang as a whole- thoughtful, inclusive, and diverse and if implemented that process, along with the initiatives herein, will make the city better able to survive the shocks and stresses the city faces.\nWe would like to thank Mayor Hendrar Prihadi for his continued\npartnership, and congratulate him on the release of this strategy.\nNone of this could have happened without his strong commitment\nto support the resilience building efforts in Semarang, from the city's\nengagement in the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network to the work we see before us today.\nWe must also commend the entire Semarang resilience team,\nincluding Chief Resilience Officer Purnomo Dwi, and Wiwiek\nHandayani, Deputy CRO. Their tireless efforts and analytical thinking\nto produce this exemplary plan is already inspiring people in cities all\nacross the world. We expect the city will continue to be a leader in a global resilience movement that will revolutionize the way cities act, think, plan, and support their citizens.\nThis document has 18 strategies and 53 initiatives, each of which were constructed to\nprovide multiple benefits, realistic timelines, and project owners and supporters. The\nfact that this document is so actionable is critical, because the need for resilience\nbuilding has never been greater not only here in Asia but around the world. The\nchallenges and pressures of climate change, urban density, social cohesion and\novertaxed infrastructure will continue to confront cities and their leadership for the\nforeseeable future.\nGoing forward, we could not be more excited to continue working with Semarang to\nsupport the implementation of key initiatives and solutions for the city and its citizens. With an engaged city leadership and the passionate resilience team, I am confident that Semarang will continue to leverage a wide range of local stakeholders and global partners to begin implementing the projects detailed within the strategy. Please accept my warmest congratulations on behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities and Rockefeller Foundation teams. We are looking forward to continuing our strong partnership with Semarang to achieve our shared vision of building more resilient cities.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSemarang continues to transform. In the\n6th century, the coastline of Semarang\nwas in the Bergota area, about 4 km from the current coastline. The continuous sedimentation from upper area of\nSemarang expanded the coastline further, thus extending the inland area, which grew into a coastal city. Unfortunately, the current trend of sea-level increase presents future flooding risk to this area.\nIf Semarang's physical transformation\nis highly dynamic, so are the challenges\nthat come with it. The city is experiencing urbanization. Its population and urban sprawl continue to grow, especially to the south and the east. Regional dynamics also increasingly play a critical role.\nTherefore, it is necessary for Semarang to continue to adapt.\nSemarang must prepare to face these\ncontinuous changes and challenges. With support from 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiated by the Rockefeller Foundation,\nSemarang started the preparation of a city resilience strategy. 100RC has developed a comprehensive understanding of city\nresilience that is based on four dimensions, including (1) Health and Wellbeing,\n(2)\tSocial and Economic Development,\n(3)\tEnvironment and Infrastructure and\n(4)\tLeadership and Strategy. All process is conducted in an inclusive manner to ensure ownership of the 100RC by various elements of city stakeholders.\nMOVING TOGETHER\nTOWARDS A RESILIENT SEMARANG\nThe development of a city resilience\nstrategy requires the participation of\nvarious city stakeholders, including\ngovernment officials, academics,\nbusinesses, the youth and community\nrepresentatives in managing the\nshocks and stresses in the city. The\ncollaborative work between city\nstakeholders identified 53 detailed\ninitiatives in achieving the shared vision of a \u201cResilient Semarang\u201d.\nWe believe in building our capacity to better\nstrengthen our city's resilience. Any efforts on improving our resilience in facing increasing shocks and stresses need to be supported\nby excellent capacity. Building capacity to\nincrease empowerment and productivity in the government, communities and institutions will become a key aspect in many of our initiatives. These initiatives fall under six pillars:\n1.SUSTAINABLE WATER AND ENERGY\nThe risk of water scarcity in\nSemarang is increasing due\nto the expected rise of future\nwater demand, topographical\nchallenges with hilly terrain and\ndrought. PDAM (the city-owned\nwater company) continues to\nimprove water access in the\ncity; however, their coverage is\nstill limited. Another challenge\nis electricity distribution as\nblackouts occur frequently in\nthe city.\nRelated to these challenges,\nSemarang identified that its water and energy consumption must be conducted sustainably. We believe this can be accomplished through a series of performance improvement actions of our\nwater management systems\nby promoting innovations in\nwater provision and fostering\nenvironmentally-friendly\nbehaviors in the community.\nTherefore, the provision of\nalternative water sources will\nbe explored. These alternative\nsources include, among others,\nrainwater harvesting, upstream\nand watershed area conservation, desalination plant and advocacy to reduce the excessive\ngroundwater use. Coordination\nwith neighboring local authorities for water provision is encouraged as it is a regional issue. Relating\nto energy, the city plans to\norganize energy-saving campaign and green building campaign.\n2.\tNEW ECONOMIC\nOPPORTUNITIES\nThe unemployment rate in the\ncity of Semarang exceeds the\naverage rate in Central Java\nand national level. One of the\ncauses is labor market gap where employment level does not meet the high number of job seekers.\nIn the past, Semarang's\nindustrial sector was dominant.\nHowever, trade and service\nsector gradually reduced\nthe dominance of industrial\nactivities. Semarang needs to\ncreatively explore additional\nalternative economic resources\nto minimize the potential increase of unemployment. The rapid development of SMEs (Small Medium Enterprises) seems to have a potential capacity in becoming a future generator of economy and employment in Semarang. Market research will be conducted in parallel with the provision of SMEs' trainings.\nAdditionally, environmentally-\nfriendly business innovations\nsuch as urban farming, waste\nrecycle and ecotourism are\npotential and will be encouraged. Traditional markets should also be revitalized, not limited only to physical improvements, but also extended to the\nmanagement and capacity of\nquality control. Furthermore,\nresearch cooperation between\nthe government, private\nsector, universities and NGOs\nin identifying new strategic\neconomic sector must be\nencouraged.\nBy creating economic climate\nthat allows the emergence of\nnew opportunities, we believe\nthat it will answer the economic and unemployment challenge in Semarang. Furthermore,\nSemarang will be able to secure the welfare of its citizens.\n3.\tREADINESS FOR\nDISASTERS AND DISEASES\nSemarang is at risk of flooding,\nlandslide, and dengue fever\noutbreak. The disasters also\nhave a vast element; they are\nconnected to regional issues and spatial planning issues and they involve various stakeholders.\nThe public must have better\nknowledge of these risks so\nthey can be better prepared.\nDissemination of information\nabout the risk of disasters\nand diseases to communities\nmust be improved. Also, the\npotential of applying the latest\ntechnology to reduce these risks will be explored.\nWhile natural causes, such\nas precipitation increase,\ncontribute to flooding, urban\nwaste materials might also\nbecome the cause of flooding.\nTherefore, urban sanitation\nsystem in Semarang must be\nimproved.\nCommunal collaborative work\nfor disaster preparation by\ndisaster preparedness groups\nare proven to be effective\nand will be encouraged to be\nreplicated. However, disaster\nprevention must also be\ncoordinated on a regional scale and consider the challenges in regional spatial planning.\nThe disasters and diseases\npose a challenge in Semarang.\nThe city must be ready to face\nthis challenge to minimize the\nimpacts. We plan to achieve\nthis by taking several actions\nthat are going to improve\ninformation sharing, innovation and collaboration in disaster and disease outbreak preparedness.\n4.\tINTEGRATED MOBILITY\nTraffic congestion in Semarang is inevitable due to the increase in private vehicles. Meanwhile, road expansion is very limited. The\nmunicipal government continued to improve the city transportation service with the provision of BRT (Bus Rapid Transit). However,\nthe institutional capacity and\nmanagement of BRT must be\nimproved. More integrated, better quality and more affordable service will interest people more into switching to public transportation.\nIt can include, among others,\nthe provision of school buses,\nimprovement of pedestrian and\nbicycle path, expansion of BRT\nroutes and improvement of bus\nstops. The network and traffic\nmanagement of BRT and the\ntraditional public transportation\nmust also be improved in order to achieve a more efficient mobility network.\nDespite transportation is a\nregional issue, there was only\nminimal regional coordination\nand this must be improved in\nthe future. Furthermore, better\nconnection to major economic\nnodes and tourism attractions can improve the overall connectivity\nand strengthen the productivity\nand activities of the citizens.\nBetter connectivity and\ninstitutional capacity of transport service has been identified as necessary. We plan to achieve this by taking several actions that are going to enhance the performance of mobility by\nimproving the quality, quantity\nand the management system of\npublic transportation, and also by promoting public transport to our community.\n5.\tTRANSPARENT PUBLIC\nINFORMATION AND\nGOVERNANCE\nThe performance of Semarang\ndevelopment budget is still\nlow, resulting to inefficient\npublic services. Musrenbang\n(development planning forum),\nwhich serves as a participatory\nplanning and budgeting platform, has been implemented, but it still has weaknesses, especially in its too rigid procedures and schedule. The performance\nof development planning and\nimplementation can still be\nimproved and realized by\nincreasing the active role of\nparticipatory monitoring from\ncommunities.\n15\nBetter access to the city's\npublic information is required to\nimprove the role of participatory monitoring by community members. Various city agencies also need to improve their data coordination and information integration. Not only that it will be beneficial for the community, integrated data will also support Semarang government in formulating effective policies with little or without overlap between government agencies.\nSemarang identified that\ndevelopment program\ninformation must be made public transparently in order to improve the quality and performance of\nthe program. We are optimist\nthat we can achieve this by taking several actions under the strategy pillar of transparent public\ninformation and governance.\nThese actions will enhance\ngovernance performance by\nimproving participatory process\nand coordination system, and\nimprove the public information\nsystem by providing integrated\ndata\n6.\tCOMPETITIVE HUMAN\nRESOURCES\nLow quality of human resources\nand skill gap among job seekers\ncontribute to the lack of\ncompetitiveness in the labor force in Semarang. The proportion of elementary and junior high school graduates is quite significant,\nwhile the proportion of graduate and diploma qualification is still low. However, labor market\nhas improved regionally and\neven internationally with the\nlaunch of the ASEAN Economic\nCommunity.\nTherefore, higher qualifications\nof labor are required in order to\nprepare Semarang workforce in\nfacing these dynamic changes.\nFuture Semarang workforces\nmust be equipped early with\ninformation regarding the\nfuture job market or provision\nof scholarships and career\nconsultancy support.\nBetter cooperation between\nemployers, academics and the\ngovernment in Semarang is\nexpected to reduce the gap in the labor market. Career information center that provides information about various career pathways\nand support job seekers to find\nthe right employers and vice\nversa could be established.\nWe identified the need to\nconnect citizen to new skills and\nknowledge. We believe we can\nfulfill the need by taking a series\nof actions which will increase the capacity of Semarang workforce by establishing information career centers and providing training,\nworkshops and information about education.\nNEXT STEPS\nSemarang must continue and\nextend the goal in becoming\nthe city with adequate security,\neffective mobility and high\ncapacity to the inhabitants and\nstakeholders. This is supported\nby the city's participation in\nthe 100RC network in which\nopportunities are open the city to collaborate with various cities and institutions on international scale, enhance our local knowledge\nand expertise in tackling urban\nchallenges.\nSemarang will become the first\ncity in Indonesia to launch a\nResilience Strategy. The launch\nis not the end but rather the\nbeginning of the city in becoming more resilient. Participatory process during the CRS\nformulation must be maintained\nin the implementation phase.\nCreating a resilient city is a\ncollective work. Future urban\nchallenges are real, and caused\nby and affected everyone. Ideas and initiatives included in this strategy are expected to inspire the municipal government,\ncitizens, business sectors and\nevery other element in Semarang to acknowledge these challenges and participate in achieving a\nresilient city.\nLet's move together to build of\nResilient Semarang!\nWHY RESILIENT CITIES?\nA resilient city is a city that continues to function in the face of various challenges and then able to recover, grow, and develop better. The people who live and work in a resilient city - particularly the poor and vulnerable - have the capacity to survive, adapt, and grow in spite of various shocks and stresses they must face.\nThroughout the years, Semarang citizens have been building resilience in order to tackle challenges. For example, in\nmanaging tidal flooding, every year\nsome coastal communities allocate their saving to increase the height of their\nhouses. Tanjung Emas Port, located near\nthese communities, built a higher new\nroad to enable access during flooding,\nso that the port can still function when faced by shocks. The city authority also implemented innovative programs such as rain water harvesting, flood and\ndengue early warning system, mangrove reforestation and many more. In the process, we also invited multi-background stakeholders to give input, for example, by forming the Urban Development City Board, with members of experts from various backgrounds. However, with the increasing challenges in the future, there should be more things to be conducted.\nAcute shock is a sudden and\ndangerous event that threatens\nthe city. Example: earthquake,\nflash flood and disease\noutbreaks.\nChronic stress is a situation that weakens the daily or periodically functions of a city. Example:\ntidal flood, water scarcity.\nchallenges, such as climate change. Therefore, Semarang participation in 100RC brings opportunities to combine our local context and expertise in facing various resilience challenges with shared lessons from international institutions and other cities in the 100RC network, supporting our efforts in improving Semarang resilience.\nSemarang is the first city in Indonesia participating in the 100RC network, along with 64 other selected cities around the world. The combination of challenges and issues faced by Semarang,opportunities to improve andi commitment to increase resilience have provided a solid ground for the city's participation in the 100RC work.\nThe 100RC organization was created by the Rockefeller Foundation and aims to help cities to be more resilient in the face of physical, social and economic shocks and stresses. Cities around the world are facing similar challenges especially with unprecedented global\nThe strategy development process also referred to the principles of resilience qualities, in order to design resilience in city systems, services, and institution:\n1. The inclusive process\nemphasizes the need for\nwider consultation and\nthe nature of \u2018mutual\ncooperation' to create\na sense of belonging, as\nwell as their shared vision\nin building city resilience.\nInclusiveness targets\nall elements of society,\nincluding vulnerable groups, persons with disabilities and it is more gender\nresponsive.\n2. Individuals or\ninstitutions that\nreflectively apply their past experience and extensive knowledge have the ability to\nidentify, prioritize\nand plan for future\nanticipations or\nconstantly changing\ntrends.\n3. The integrated\nprocess can unify\nsystems and institutions and enable cooperation to achieve greater goals.\n4. The existence of\nresponsive oversight,\ntransparency and control\nsystem enables fast actions and precise handling in the event of shocks or pressure\nThe CRF also covers 12\ndrivers that collectively\nassessing the city's\nstrengths and weaknesses, and uncovering opportunities to address vulnerabilities.\n5.

Robust designs,\nsystems and assets\nare elements that\nare properly created,\norganized, and\nmaintained that they are safe from damage in the face of shocks and can withstand pressure.\n7. Redundancy refers\nto having capacity\nalternatives, substitution or diverse resources, providing the city with alternative\nstrategies or other methods in the face of shocks and stresses.\n29\nABOUT THIS DOCUMENT\nThe resilience strategy document is expected to function as an initial step in achieving resilient Semarang. City resilience strategy will help in creating benefits with minimum investment or even to increase investments in the city. Other than that, city resilience strategy can minimize the costs resulting from shocks and stresses and invite the community to actively participate in city development.\nSemarang medium-term development planning cycle is every 5 years and is part of the 25 years long term development plan. The timing of Semarang resilience strategy development is in parrarel with the drafting of the 2016-2021 Semarang RPJMD (Medium-Term Development Plan). This makes the completion of city resilience strategy is in great momentum to better support the overall city development plan. The strategy and initiative in the Semarang City Resilience Strategy are expected to support and complement the programs in the RPJMD. The strategy also focuses on the directives of the 2005-2025 Semarang long-term development planning (RPJP), which include:\n- Achieve cultured and quality community life\n-\tAchieve a more reliable government to increase public service\n-\tAchieve a dynamic and environmentally insightful metropolitan city\n-\tStrengthen people\u2019s economy that is based on local excellence and build a conductive business climate.\nThis document can also be used as a proposal and investment tool of which can be proposed to obtain funding commitment unrelated to the government\u2019s budget. Participation in the 100RC enables Semarang to collaborate with international institutions and other cities in the 100RC network. The initiatives included in the city resilience strategy document can also be supported by the central or provincial government, or national or international donor and research institutions.\nCommunity, businesspeople and various stakeholders in Semarang are actors who will be affected by the shocks and stresses in the city. The initiatives included in the document are expected to inspire these actors in realizing actions to face the urban challenges and taking part in building city resilience.\nTherefore, the document is expected to be able to support collaboration between various stakeholders in Semarang, Indonesia and the international world.\nSTRATEGY DEVELOPMENT GOVERNANCE\nThe city resilience strategy development was\ncoordinated by the CRO (Chief Resilience Officer) team. The team was supported by six working groups related to the analysis process of each priority aspect. In the process, the team found a number of inputs from various city stakeholders during a series of meetings and workshops.\nDuring the development, the team had received\nguidance from the Resilience Steering Committee. The committee included the City Secretary, acting as the committee advisor; and the head of Semarang's BAPPEDA (Regional Development Planning Board), acting as the committee\nchairperson. The team was also supported by\nother urban decision makers, representatives of\nthe business sector, academics, and community\nrepresentatives. In terms of developing the\nsubstance, the team also consulted with the\nalready established Urban Development Advisory Council whose members were made up of experts representing various fields in Semarang.\nThe strategy formulation was also supported by\nMercy Corps Indonesia as the strategy partner.\nVISION: RESILIENT SEMARANG\nSemarang is paving its way to work together towards a great\ncity. Through collaborative and inclusive efforts, we will become a much more resilient city with enhanced security, efficient mobility and excellent capacity and will embrace practicing resilience as a part of our culture.\nSecurity: Establish an urban system\nin Semarang that meets basic needs,\nensures socio-economic security and\nprepares for disaster emergencies and\ndisease outbreaks\nMobility: Provide efficient accessibility\nand connectivity for improving the\ncommunity's wellbeing\nCapacity: Building the capacity of all\nstakeholders, increasing their productivity and capabilities in urban development\nSHORT PROFILE OF SEMARANG\nSemarang is the capital of Central Java Province and the fifth largest city in Indonesia. Semarang and 5 other neighboring regions form what is called the Kedungsepur Urban National Strategic Area, placing Semarang in a strategic position.\nSemarang has international hubs located at Tanjung Mas Port and Ahmad Yani Airport, which also function as the main economic gate in Central Java.\nSemarang is adjacent to 3 districts, i.e. Kendal, Semarang and Demak. Semarang has 16 subdistricts and 177 keturahan.\nTOPOGRAPHY OF SEMARANG\nSemarang has a varied topography. Although known more as a coastal city, hilly areas can also be found in Semarang. The lowland in the north region along the coast is known as Semarang bawah (lower). The old city\u2019s center and also the center of government and trade are located in this area.\nMeanwhile, the hilly south region is known as Semarang atas (upper). Waduk Jatibarang (reservoir) is located here. The city development is increasingly moving to the upper region. This trend threatens the upstream area that functions as a conservation area.\nCOASTLINE SHIFTING\nIn the 6th century, the coastline of Semarang was in Bergota area, not too far from Simpang Lima area (the current city center).\nThe sedimentation is coming from upper Semarang to the coastal area, shifting the coastline further to the Java Sea. Until 2007, the coastline has extended as far as 36,5km.\nThe current climate change affects coastal abrasion and reduces ground height on the new dry land as a result from sedimentation. Coastal abrasion causes the coastline to shift inland as far as 2.6 km (Wicaksono in Climate Week, 2015).\nSemarang Coastline Shift Map\nSource: Research and Development, SANITATION AND LANDSCAPING OFFICE, UNDIP, IPB, 2009\nRESILIENT SEMARANG\nJawa Sea\nSemarang is a multicultural city with various ethnicities inhabiting the city. The diverse culture has been evident for a long time, and the community lives harmoniously with each other. This is one of the strengths of Semarang community; social provocations do not really work and social conflicts are\nrare.\nURBAN DEVELOPMENT\nSemarang city began to develop in the coastal area. The Dutch also built here before Indonesia independence and now it is become the Old City area. However, lately the trend shifted physically and culturally. There have been urban sprawl in the city and the community now inhabits the suburban area, far from the coast.\nPeople live in various kampung\nneighbourhoods. Kampung is high density urban settlement neighbourhood where residents build their own houses. Each kampung has strong identity and traditions such as communal work (gotong royong). While large part of Semarang is still kampung, the new development in suburban area shifts toward formal landed housing by developers.\nSEMARANG RESILIENCE CHALLENGE\nSemarang has a long history\u2014 approaching its 469th anniversary in 2016\u2014 and it continues to transform.\nThe city of 1.5 million inhabitants is facing an economic transition from an industrially based economy to services and trade. Semarang's industrial area has moved to the outskirts of the city, thus creating changes. The labor force must respond to these changes with better preparation. Built up areas of Semarang and the surrounding areas grow rapidly in a sprawling pattern, which is not supported by the provision of adequate transport services and infrastructure.\nSemarang deals with various physical challenges due to its geography as\na coastal city, such as tidal flooding,\nerosion, land subsidence and rising sea levels, which threatens the lowlands of Semarang. Simultaneously, development in the hilly upper Semarang has led to a decrease of tree coverage in\nthe upstream area, which severely increases vulnerability to landslides,\nwater shortages and floods. Regarding\nhealth issues, as a tropical city Semarang is prone to outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).\nThese shocks and stresses present more continuous challenges for Semarang. These interrelated challenges, if left unaddressed, can lead to more problems and increase the severity of further shocks. Shocks and stresses can upset both the environment and the continuity of business service\u2014and when the business sector is disrupted, residents lose their livelihood. The marginal and poor communities are most people that are most greatly affected by these issues.\nRelated to the resilient status of Semarang and to complement the shock and stress assessment, 100RC also helped us to identify public perception of the city's performance of resilience. The assessment was conducted by holding workshops with participants from the government, the business sector, local universities, and communities. These participants were asked to mention and measure resilience-related factors in Semarang.\nThe results of the assessment showed that people were more concerned with certain dimensions of resilience, such as infrastructure and basic needs. This result was consistent with the assessment on shocks and stresses in Semarang. Factors related to infrastructure and basic needs were more frequently mentioned and considered most important. However, the performance of the city on both factors was considered weak, as seen in the following image. In the image, it can be seen that, for example, sanitation assets were reviewed as poor and must be upgraded.\n45\nPhysical shocks and stresses are perceived as the main challenge in the city because they are easy to identify and people can directly relate to them. Yet, while intervention was conducted to tackle said shocks and stresses, the result of this intervention was not optimal, indicating that there were other weaknesses that were not being addressed.\nThere seemed to be less public attention to leadership, strategy, and socioeconomic dimensions, which was confirmed by the resilience assessment. Furthermore, a more thorough analysis found problems\nrelated to siloed planning and management between the municipal agencies and provincial government, a lack of information dissemination to the public and low education levels, which are reflected in the limited capacity of the city.\nThis shows that the shocks and stresses, as well as the perception assessment, can easily recognize that there is much attention paid to the perceived problems of infrastructure, basic needs and congestion, while there is less attention paid to the issue of capacity. However, we believe that capacity serves an important function in improving our resilience. Any efforts on improving our resilience in facing increasing shocks and stresses needs to be supported with excellent capacity. Therefore, this city resilience strategy will put a lot of attention on building capacity, specifically on building capacity for the government, communities and institutions to increase empowerment and productivity. This holistic view of seeing the relationship of perceived problems and function is reflected in the following graph.\nTidal floods, DHF outbreaks, landslides, and\u2014more recently\u2014 flash floods affect the city of Semarang, due to its coastal position. The city also has a large task in providing for the basic needs, such as water and electricity, of its citizens. Physical shocks combined with stresses\u2014 such as a high level of unemployment\u2014 can increase the impact of the shocks and reduce the community's ability to survive, especially within poor and vulnerable\ncommunities.\nA resilient city is a place that can provide protection for the inhabitants. As the first\nstep, city inhabitants must be able to survive and adapt to various shocks and stresses. Security is the basis of strengthening resilience in Semarang against the shocks and stresses that have a direct impact on the community; security also covers the issues that were identified by city stakeholders. A successful urban system is a system that can provide protection and security to the community.\nCLEAN WATER\nThe main water sources in Semarang\nare (1) water springs, which contribute\nup to 11%, (2) underground water, which\nsupplies up to 19% and (3) surface water, which is estimated to provide a whopping 70% of the residents' water. However,\nthe quality of these sources is threatened by both domestic and non-domestic waste into the river. Another problem is\nsaltwater intrusion in the northern part of the city. The concentrate of chloride (Cl) has been increasing steadily for the past 20 years. Chloride content in clean water must not exceed 250 mg\/L; levels higher than that indicate poor water quality. The underground water in the coastal area of Semarang exceeds the maximum level of chloride found in clean water.\nMeanwhile, the need for clean water tends to increase along with rising population. It is estimated that the need for clean water will continue to increase up to 200% in the next 15 years. The city\u2019s water demand is supplied by water sources that are managed by the state-owned water company (PDAM) as well as non-PDAM parties. The Semarang PDAM manages their water source in a network of pipelines. Some sources of surface water are still in their development process and have not yet been utilized, including Waduk (reservoir) Jatibarang with the capacity of 1,000L\/s, Blorong River with the capacity of 200L\/s and Pramuka water processing installation (IPA) with the capacity of 200L\/s.\n49\nMeanwhile, non-PDAM parties distribute water via a pipeline system and a nonpipeline system. Non-pipeline distribution by non-PDAM parties contributes 31% of the total clean water in the city, which comes from dug wells and pumped wells. The proportion of this contribution is still very high.\nThe 100:0:100 program listed in the 2015-2019 RPJMN targeted 100% clean water service in the city. In order to reach the target, the quality level of clean water service via a pipeline system by both PDAM and non-PDAM in Semarang must\nIMAGE 3 CLEAN WATER SERVICE IN SEMARANG IN 2015 Source : Semarang PDAM, 2015\nbe increased. One of the challenges in providing clean water to citizens of Semarang is the diversity of topographic conditions in the city. For example, Keturahan Gunung Pati has a steep slope level of 20-40%, which means that the PDAM cannot provide any water service at this location. Besides that, population increase subsequently causes the demand of clean water to increase as well. Twenty percent of the total citizens that have not been covered by the PDAM will be encouraged to get water from non-underground water sources.\nENERGY\nMatching water demand, as the number of citizens in Semarang increases, so too does the energy consumption level, concentrated in electricity and transportation. The supply of electricity is still balanced against the demand from various sectors. Demand for energy is supplied by the steam power plant (PLTU) Tambak Lorok in the North Semarang sub-district; there is a plan for a water power plant in Jatibarang. Supply of electricity in Semarang is managed under the authority of the central government. The electrical system in Semarang is connected to the Java-Bali national electricity system, supplied by several main power sources such as Paiton and Jepara. The 9 main power relay stations in Semarang meet the 2,000 MW demand, but despite that, power outage happens often. In 2013,\nIMAGE 4 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION LEVEL FROM THE ENERGY SECTOR IN 2020 AND THE 2020 PREDICTION IN SEMARANG\nSource: 2010-2020 Greenhouse Gas Profile\nthere were 1,144 reports of power outage to the state-owned electricity company\/PLN (BPS 2014).\nIronically, non-renewable energy\nresources such as oil, gas and coal are still predominantly used to fulfill energy needs in Semarang, despite the fact that these sources will be exhausted sooner with their continuous consumption. Furthermore, both fuel and electricity consumption increase emission levels.\nEnergy consumption in Semarang contributes to the city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. It is predicted that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector can increase up to 74.7% in 2020 with the current energy consumption pattern. Energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources are needed to ensure the continuation of energy service for the citizens of Semarang.\nECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT\nThe challenge that must be faced by the city in terms of employment is the imbalance and mismatch between the labor demand and the available employment. The percentage of unemployment in Semarang is 7.76%, higher than the average percentage in the province of Central Java (5.86%). Since Semarang is the province\u2019s capital and one of the metropolitan centers in Java, workers and job seekers also come from outside of the city.\nThe industrial sector holds the highest levels of employment in Semarang, yet its contribution to the city\u2019s economy is the second highest after trade, and the hotel and restaurant sector. However, based on the RPJMD, Semarang is encouraged to transition to a trade and service city. Therefore, the economy is shifting towards the trade and hospitality sectors, and then to a processing and communication sector. Meanwhile, the industrial sector would continue to develop in the suburban outskirts of the city. This goal must be supported by preparing the adequate labor force.\nThe number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is growing, on average, 2.83% annually (Semarang municipal secretary) with a total of 11,585 SMEs in 2014. SME is a potential sector to reduce the income gap. Popular SMEs in Semarang are, among others, smoked milkfish business, hand-made batik and traditional food processing. SMEs are a part of the formal sector but they are offset by the informal sector spread in the city. SMEs and informal sector do not only provide goods and services to consumers with low purchasing power, but they also cater to the needs of consumers with higher purchasing power. Small enterprises also provide raw materials or services to medium and large enterprises, including the local government. The social purpose of these businesses is to achieve the minimum level of welfare, which guarantees the provision of basic needs to all members of the community.\nIn the context of fairness and equality, men currently dominate labor in Semarang, with a ratio of 60:40, although the gender proportion of job seekers is 50:50. Equality between male and female laborers and also disabled people must be taken into consideration; everyone is entitled to equal rights to gain income.\nOther than that, health and social security for the people must be extended, not only to the formal sector but also to the informal sector. The formal sector\u2019s participation in insurance schemes is good enough, however, workers in the informal sector\u2014 including traders, fishermen or freelance laborers\u2014do not adequately participate. This low participation in the\nDISASTERS\nSemarang is known for different types of disaster especially with its frequent flooding. There are two types of floods that occur in Semarang, i.e. tidal flooding caused by, among other things, the increase of seawater level and land subsidence (causing seawater to flood the coastal area), and flash flooding (a sudden flood due to high precipitation that increases the river\u2019s\ninformal sector is due to the community\u2019s lack of awareness surrounding insurance, though there is potential for development in the informal sector as well as in micro enterprises and small and medium enterprises.\nAnother sector that holds an important role is the market, both modern and traditional. Modern and traditional markets affect the regional income. The income tax from businesspeople and traders can increase the original regional income (PAD). It is then necessary to maintain the presence of the market. Other than functioning economically, traditional markets specifically have historical values that should be maintained, such as in Pasar Johar.\nwater discharge). There are 21 rivers located in Semarang, creating a high risk of flash flood. Other contributing factors to flash floods include poor drainage infrastructure, environmental degradation in the upstream area, sedimentation in the downstream area and high precipitation.\nCommunal waste management can also contribute to the likelihood of a flood disaster. Flash floods and tidal floods are related to the community\u2019s neglect towards the environment, such as in the case of littering. Furthermore, the municipal government\u2019s waste management service only managed to pick up 34% of the total waste in 2013, and left behind the remaining 66%. This illustrates the poor management of the city\u2019s waste, considering 50% of the total population was not covered by the service\u2014 especially in the slum kampung where the low income and vulnerable people live.\nFlood disaster is a regional issue, since it is not isolated to one particular area.\nIt needs thorough management and requires cooperation between different administrative regions. For example, the upstream area of the Kali Garang watershed is located in the Semarang district. The development trend towards areas in upper Semarang, which initially was established as a conservation area, creates a more complex situation.\nSource: Research and Technology, SANITATION AND LANDSCAPING OFFICE, UNDIP, IPB, 2009 IMAGE 7 THE ESTIMATION OF SEAWATER LEVEL INCREASE\nMeanwhile, tidal flooding, beginning in 1957, is increasingly worse due to land subsidence and climate change causing seawater rise. Vital assets such as the airport, the rail station and the port are located in areas that are prone to tidal flooding. The rate of land subsidence, which compounds the impact of tidal floods, has increased to >10-13 cm\/year. Underground water extraction, a key source of water in the city, also increases the likelihood of land subsidence. This creates more problems in water provision because the current pipeline network is still limited.\nSea levels are estimated to increase by around 15.5 cm by 2030 and 77.5 cm in 2110. However, land subsidence poses a greater, more urgent threat to the community. It reached a growth rate of 13 cm annually in 2015, meaning that tidal floods would affect around 300,000 people inhabiting the coastal area of Semarang, including North Semarang, East Semarang sub-district and Gayamsari sub-district.\nUnfortunately, the residents in said coastal communities mainly work as factory workers and fishermen, and do not have the resources to mitigate these issues. Some of them adapted their houses to be higher than the ground surface, while some simply see the flood as a part of normal life considering it happens so often. Furthermore, their kampung is largely comprised of slums and exist in poor conditions.\nBeyond this, landslide incidents also occur in Semarang, especially in the higher altitude areas of South and East Semarang. Landslides are influenced by the fluctuation of precipitation, type of soil, and decreased vegetation due to higher development in risk prone areas. This offers a challenge with the current development trend towards the hilly upper Semarang.\nThe government of Indonesia (GoI)\nencourages efforts to reduce the risk of\ndisasters by establishing disaster-resilient kelurahan (rural villages). On that note, Semarang established a Disaster-preparedness Group (KSB) to reduce the impacts of disasters on a kelurahan level. By the end of 2014, Semarang established 22 KSBs in locations that\nwere prone to floods, landslides and fires.\nEvery kelurahan that is prone to disasters must be continuously encouraged to establish KSBs. Furthermore, training and knowledge sharing on the risk of disasters must be spread and applied in the community.\nSource: Taken from different sources, 2016\nIMAGE 8 THE LOCATIONS OF SETTLEMENTS PRONE TO MASS MOVEMENT IN 2014\n\u201cA phenomenon to spontaneously help each other, such as establishing a\ndisaster command center, getting things to higher ground and collecting\ndonation for flood victims, naturally happens in villages as a way to response (to disasters)\u201d,\n(Rendy A. Diningrat,\nwinner of 100RC blog writing competition, 2015)\nDISEASE OUTBREAKS\nTropical climate and the steady increase of temperature due to climate change have aided the flourishing of different types of viruses in Semarang. High levels of humidity also encourage mosquitoes to breed, which is one reason why Semarang has a high number of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases, the 3rd highest number of DHF cases in Indonesia in 2015.\nDHF is caused by dengue virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti. Aedes aegypti can breed in abandoned houses, empty land, midden, poultry enclosure, horticultural garden, mosques, stagnate gutters, water parks,\nwater container behind water dispenser and refrigerator units that often are overlooked by people.\nHuman population density is another factor of DHF occurrence, where dense areas would tend to have more DHF case. People younger than 14 years old are more prone to contract DHF. Special care and interventions are needed to reduce the risk of DHF in this vulnerable age group, for example by conducting interventions at their locations and during their activities. DHF prevention efforts at school should become one of the main concerns, considering school-aged children spend much of their time at school, especially in the morning (Semarang HCVA, 2015).\nMOBILITY\nRELATED SHOCKS AND STRESSES\nIf Semarang fails to provide good access and connectivity, the fundamental element of security cannot be achieved. A city with good mobility can support its citizens to conduct various activities easily and affordably. Good mobility also prevents geographical isolation that weakens the social relationships between communities and other groups.\nChallenges related to mobility have been put under the spotlight considering the increasing risk of congestion in numerous parts of Semarang. Public transportation is still not optimal in both its quantity and quality. The condition is complicated further by the sprawling regional development, preventing infrastructures to be provided\nefficiently.\nPUBLIC TRANSPORTATION\nSemarang is the provincial capital, located strategically, supported by train line, seaport and airport; goods and human transport here is very active.\nThe annual increase of population in Semarang also increases the demand of mobility. However, the quality and quantity of public transportation in the city is inadequate, causing people to choose their private vehicles over public transport.\nThe growth of private vehicle ownership in the past five years has shown a significant increase, especially for\nmotorbikes. From 2013 to 2014, private vehicle ownership increased as much as 16%, while road only grew 0.09%.\nThe management of public transport in Semarang is not yet integrated and effective, despite establishing the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system.\nThe quantity of the BRT unit is insufficient, causing a longer waiting period at every bus stop, especially at bus channels with a high number of passengers. The separated public transport system also raises the cost of transportation, particularly when passengers have to change to different buses\u2014they have to pay for each bus separately. The buses themselves, as well\nas the bus stops, are in poor condition with a host of damages. Bus stops were designed to have a higher platform than the pavement; however, this separates BRT from other modes of public transportation.\nPrivate vehicles, especially motorbikes, can be purchased quite easily and cheaply, which attracts more people\nto get their own. This, in return, increases congestion significantly. One major concern is the low supervision of the use of private vehicles on the road. Underage students are often found driving, having obtained their driving license illegally. These students never took the driving exam that should have been obligatory to ensure the adequate mastery of driving. This increases the number of road accidents.\nURBAN SPRAWL AND COMMUTE\nAnother challenge regarding public transportation is its limited coverage; it is not able to cover every area in Semarang. Transportation in Semarang can be categorized into two types: formal and informal. Formal transportation modes include minibus (angkot), bus and BRT, while informal transportation modes include motor taxi (ojek') and rickshaw. There are more than 2,000 public minibuses and 90 formal routes in Semarang, but despite this some areas are still not covered. Many of these areas are settlement or trip generation areas, so the inhabitants choose to use informal transportation modes that actually do not adhere to government-implemented conditions of public transportation.\nThe spreading of the city in urban sprawl with people moving to work and study\nSanti,\n59 years old\ncitizen of\nKelurahan Rowosari\npresent a challenge in providing transport infrastructure. The cost of infrastructure and service for transportation will increase and coordination with the surrounding areas will be needed to manage this challenge.\nPrivate vehicles are a more attractive option than public transport. However, this creates several issues. On one hand, private vehicles enable the community to conveniently reach their destination, but on the other hand, they increase congestion. The highest mobility can be found on main roads, despite the capacity of these roads remaining low, which results in congestion. Transportation is also a high emission source\u2014with high frequency of congestion, the produced emission will increase.\n\u201c...where I live there isn't any public transport, so we rely on our motorbike. If we didn't have the motorbike it would be hard to go to places. The kids take the minibus operated by someone in the neighborhood...\u201d\nCAPACITY\nRELATED SHOCKS AND STRESSES\nCapacity is the keyword in understanding city resilience in the context of 100RC and the basis of strengthening said resilience. However, capacity is not yet considered crucial in Semarang. The system does not have enough capacity when a city has a great potential in the economy, location and funding, but is unable to improve quality of life.\nDespite its great potential, Semarang cannot progress to the next level because it is\nnot able to mobilize resources from various levels. Not only does the government lack\nthis ability, but so too do other stakeholders, including academics, communities, the\nbusiness sector and greater society. Furthermore, the current governance system and\nleadership cannot support the participation of stakeholders in contributing to the city's\ndevelopment.\nAchieving good governance and a responsible government requires implementation of\nthe principles of accountability, transparency and legal supremacy by involving members of community in the drafting process of every public policy. The community must be accommodated throughout this process. This effort, although still not optimal, had been implemented in the development planning of Semarang.\nCOORDINATION FOR\nDEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION\nIn carrying out the planned programs,\nthe availability of resources and the\nability to allocate those resources are\nthe foundation for achieving optimal\ndevelopment. The ability to allocate\navailable resources is based in the\nability to lead, shown in the way the city government utilizes the knowledge or\ndeep understanding of various potentials and problems in order to find various alternative solutions.\nThere are four issues in building the\ncapacity of resources: institution,\nknowledge, leadership and accountability. Based on the workshop and capacity\nassessment of Semarang held by the 100RC team, the city\u2019s ability was considered still inadequate and required more improvement, especially in the aspects of strategic environment, regional finance, human resources, knowledge development and inclusivity.\nStrategic environmental analysis must be considered in drafting policies and budgets. This has been applied in the city\u2019s planning and policy documents, however this is not supported by an analysis related to the capacity of Semarang in facing and creating a strategic environment in managing various changes. This indicated that a dialogue mechanism to discuss strategic environment had not yet been seen as a priority.\nSemarang\u2019s financial management is based on the regional budget (APBD). APBD management is targeted to create an illustration of the regional financial capacity and ability to fund regional development. In general, sources of funding in regional finance are derived from 2 sources: regional income (tax, levy and grant), and other funds from the cooperation between the government and other parties (joint venture and concession).\nThe issue in this context is the high amount of undisbursed funds (SILPA) in Semarang. In 2014, SILPA reached 33%, far above the allowed percentage (6%). Infrastructure programs have low budget\nabsorption, with some only reaching 50%. This could indicate that the city\u2019s preparedness in managing shocks and stresses might be reduced. As the value of SILPA increases annually, it shows that the funds from PAD and other regional income sources have not been absorbed optimally. Furthermore, another problem is the absence of a follow-up of the SKPD program post-evaluation.\nOne of the key components in achieving an inclusive Semarang is the availability of a mechanism to ensure community\u2019s participation. Musrenbang, a regional development-planning forum represents this type of participatory development planning. The municipal government holds Musrenbang annually. This forum is conducted in phases on a neighborhood, keturahan, sub-district and municipal level in order to collect people\u2019s opinions related to city development. Unfortunately, the implementation design of Musrenbang is heavily influenced by a top-down approach, signified by the unified planning approaches in the national and regional level. The forum is often too rigid and formal, especially concerning the schedule. It is too short to enable a more intensive participation and communication between the government and community.\nPUBLIC INFORMATION\nSemarang, a metropolis in the Central Java Province, has a faster information cycle compared to the surrounding cities or districts. Therefore, periodic informational updates and collection of the newest information are necessary to improve future policies and regulations in Semarang. It is necessary to highlight the importance of transparency in information. Accountability of the government can be increased through the mechanism and implementation of principles of transparency.\n\u201cSemarang government must improve their communication with the community because people would also like to be involved in the development of Semarang\u201d\n(@richamiskiyya, a participant of the 100RC Twitter competition, 2015).\nPublic information is valued in two ways, from the government and community. The information from the government is expected to be complete, transparent, and integrated between the SKPDs, while information from the community is expected to include reports and permits that people require so they can be followed up fast and properly.\nThe city facilitates information sharing via electronic media that can be accessed easily by the community. However, the problem is that not all communities can access electronic media, which means that information dispersion via print media or government socialization is still needed. The community expects a clearer system for permit processing as well as its easy application. The permit application process currently takes a long time. However, ease is not the only factor observed. Adequate and transparent information will enable people to apply for permits correctly and thus help create a better city development.\nPeople\u2019s complaints must be collected and followed up in a two-way process between the government and community.\nIt is expected that this will improve public service performance. Too many separate outlets for complaint have caused some complaints to go unnoticed. Another problem is that a facility for people to file a complaint has still not been properly introduced.\nHUMAN RESOURCES\nThe level of educational qualification is not balanced in Semarang. The gap between primary school and junior high school graduates is quite significant. It shows that the education level of some citizens of Semarang is still relatively low. With a low education level, they would face problems in gaining employment. Therefore, to improve their welfare, they must improve their education level. Most of the available employment requires workers with a minimum high school degree. This situation contributes to the low productivity of Semarang\u2019s citizens.\nMeanwhile, around 27% of the total workers of the Semarang government office only has a high-school degree, while 48% has a bachelor\u2019s degree, 5% has a master\u2019s degree and only 1 person has a doctorate. This is evidently a challenge that must be dealt by building educational capacity to improve the organizational ability and regulatory system in mobilizing resources to improve the city\u2019s development in the future.\nRESILIENT CITY STRATEGY\nSemarang city resilience strategy is built on capacity building of the city's institutions, people and communities while addressing the main challenges in providing security and mobility. Therefore, the city resilience strategy covers the perceived challenges and functionality and capacity of the city in facing shocks and stresses.\nEach initiative mainly tackles direct challenges, but it is strongly based on capacity building of the affected stakeholders in order to build and maintain their resilience better. People and communities respond, adapt and learn when they face shocks and stresses\nthat are beyond technical solutions and infrastructure. A holistic view on Semarang resilience challenges includes 18 strategies and 53 initiatives that fall under the six pillar strategy.\nThe six pillars are, as follows:\n1.\tSUSTAINABLE WATER\nAND ENERGY\nSemarang will meet and\nuse water and energy in\na sustainable manner to\naddress challenges such as\nthe risk of water scarcity,\ndecreasing quality of water and undistributed electricity.\n2.\tNEW ECONOMIC\nOPPORTUNITIES\nSemarang will create an\neconomic climate that\nallows the emergence of\nnew opportunities in order\nto decrease the number of\nunemployment and prepare\nfor a new economic status as a center of trade and services\n3.\tPREPAREDNESS FOR\nDISASTERS AND DISEASE\nOUTBREAKS\nSemarang will improve\ninformation sharing, innovation and collaboration for improving the preparedness for disasters and disease outbreaks\n4.\tINTEGRATED MOBILITY\nSemarang will improve the\nconnectivity and institutional\ncapacity of transportation\nservice to address mobility\nchallenges such as traffic\ncongestion, poor quality of\npublic transportation and poor accessibility\n5.\tTRANSPARENT PUBLIC\nINFORMATION AND\nGOVERNANCE\nSemarang will increase\ninformation transparency and governance to improve the quality of the program and its performance considering the performance of development budget is still low, resulting in inefficient public services\n6.\tCOMPETITIVE HUMAN\nRESOURCES\nSemarang will provide access to new skills and knowledge for the citizens, preparing the ASEAN Economic Community launch and also capacity\nbuilding of Semarang labor\nforce, considering their current low qualification.\nTHE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRATEGIES AND PILLARS\nOur pillars and strategies are interrelated to ensure that the strategies and initiatives provide integrated solutions. \u201cTransparent Public Information and Governance\u201d and \u201cCompetitive Human Resources\u201d are strongly correlated to other pillar strategies, showing our focus on building capacity towards better city resilience.\nOne pillar has elements that are related to other strategies under a different pillar. For example, our strategy on developing environmental and social-friendly businesses under \u201cNew Economic\nOpportunities\u201d is closely related to our innovation effort in water provision under \u201cSustainable Water and Energy\u201d and preparing workforce for the job market under \u201cCompetitive Human Resources\u201d.\nThis interrelationship also presents in other pillars.\nThis image below shows the\ninterrelationship between the strategies and pillars, describing the integrated and holistic view in building resilience. The straight, bold line shows a stronger relationship between pillars.\n1.\tEnhancing the performance of basic water management\n2.\tPromoting innovations in water provision\n3.\tPromoting environmentally friendly behaviors\nNew Economic Opportunities\n1.\tPromoting entrepreneurship to increase the competitiveness of trade and services\n2.\tDeveloping environmentally-friendly and socially oriented innovative businesses\n3.\tStrengthening multi-stakeholder (academic, business, community, government) partnership to create job opportunities\n1.\tDeveloping technology tor disaster and disease management\n2.\tEnhancing the capacity of stakeholders in disaster and disease management\n3.\tImproving coordination in disaster risk reduction\n11 Initiatives\n1.\tEncouraging a\nchange in behavior from using private vehicles to public transport\n2.\tImproving\ncoordination\nand institutional\nmanagement of\npublic transport\n3.\tIntegrating\ntransportation\nplanning\n1.\tOptimizing\nMusrenbang\n(development\nplanning forum) in\nthe planning process\n2.\tImproving the\nintegration of\nplanning and city\nbudgeting\n3.\tOptimizing the\ngovernment's\ncoordination of data\nintegration and public information\n1.

In 2015, the PDAM managed to cover 59% of the total area and non-PDAM covered 9.4%, whilst the rest of the population met their need through nonpipeline network. Considering this condition, this strategy is trying to build, develop and optimize the management of clean water so that the pipeline service coverage of clean water from both PDAM and non-PDAM will reach 100%, aligned with the national target.\nA3 | Advocacy and\nPartnership with Provincial\nGovernment and Surrounding Regions\nA1 | Improve Monitoring and Imposing Better Sanction for River Pollution\nKey\nInitiative\nAdvancing\nSixty nine percent of the\ntotal amount of clean water\nin Semarang comes from the\nrivers. However, the quality of\nthese rivers is decreasing due to pollution. Therefore, the initiative must be conducted immediately in order to maintain the quality of clean water for the community.\nAction: Improving a sanction mechanism for river polluters and developing communal waste treatment that is aligned with the Regional Regulation No. 6\/2012 on waste management and the Regional\nRegulation No. 13\/2006 on environment control. Monitoring system must also be improved. The\nwatershed area (DAS) from upstream to downstream potentially can become a major source of clean water. Coordination with neighbouring areas is also necessary.\nResilience value:\nRiver and environment\nthat are conserved\nproperly can improve\nthe quality of water\nsource as well as public health.

Prolonged drought pushes the public and government to create an innovative alternative clean water supply, such as Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) and the development of grey water recycling process. Therefore, the strategy's aim is ensuring the continuous provision of good quality clean water during the rainy and dry season.\nB4 | Explore the Possibility of Sea Water Desalination\nB1 | Extend the Utilization of Rain Water\nRain Water Harvesting\/\nRWH is collecting and storing\nrain water for later use. The\ninitiative has been introduced in\nSemarang by some institutions\nfor various purposes. Semarang\nEnvironmental Office initiated\nthe installation of RWH at\npublic and educational facilities,\nlocated at Kelurahan Tandang\nand Kelurahan Wonosari. The\nSemarang Water, Energy and\nMineral Resources Office used\nthis method to reduce the\namount of runoff and manage\nfloods. The Semarang Agricultural\nOffice applied the method to\nirrigate agricultural land. The\nRWH has the potential to become\nan alternative water source in\nthe city, especially water scarce\nareas.\nAction: Promoting the concept of RWH and providing support for the initial construction which may include\noffering incentive and guidance for households that will be installing\nthe RWH.

Considering that fossil fuel is not renewable, initiatives must be planned to prevent excessive consumption of fossil fuel. While the provision of fuel and electricity is under the national government's authority, energy issues must be addressed at municipal level. The city should encourage energy-saving behaviors and the development of alternative energy to preserve the environment.\nOther than identifying alternative water resources (explained in the previous section), it is also important to consume water wisely. Water conservation needs to be encouraged, minimizing water exploitation..\nThere are a lot of ways to conserve energy, such as turning lights off when not in use, using shower (instead of a bath) and minimizing the use of private vehicles. Such simple actions, when conducted collectively, can save water and energy.\nOngoing\nC1 | Campaign for Public Awareness to Save Energy and Water\nKey\nInitiative\nThe WWF named Semarang\nenergy-efficient city in 2014 for\nthe efforts to reduce the effects\nof greenhouse gas emission and\nenergy consumption. The high\nemission of greenhouse gases\ncontributes to climate change.\nThe citizens must adopt energy-\nsaving behavior, reducing GHG\nemission. Similarly, people must\nbe able to conserve water.\nSaving energy and water can\nbe performed by individual,\ncompanies and government.\nSome youth communities\ninitiated a power-saving\nmovement, such as the \u201cturn\npower off for 1 hour\u201d campaign.

The BLU-UPTD currently manages both BRT and Mangkang regional terminal with limited human resources. The current system requires an evaluation and must considers the business plan related to the BRT expansion plan.\nCoordination mechanism\nbetween the government and\nprivate sector (operator and\nregulator) should be clarified\nto ensure professionalism of\nBRT management. It includes\na bidding process to ensure\nthe management meets the\nnecessary quality.\nAction: Developing an\nimproved organizational mechanism between the government and private sector in managing and operating BRT\nResilience value:\nReorganizing BRT\nmanagement to create\na more effective system which will improve the service quality. The\ngovernment will be\nable to provide reliable mobility and improve citizens' access to their activities.\nTransportation, Communication and Informatics Office\nSemarang BLU-UPTD (Public\nService Agency-Technical\nImplementation Unit for Regional Agency), Semarang Development Planning Agency, private sector\nInventing\nB2 | Establish a Public Transport Consortium\nKey\nInitiative\nApart from BRT, which\nis managed by the local\ngovernment, other public\ntransport vehicles are managed\nby individuals. The individual\nowners of public vehicles provide a subsidy for public transport users without any assistance from the government. However, the individual ownership of\nmany public transport vehicles\ncomplicates monitoring of\nmany things including safety.\nThe establishment of a public\ntransport consortium will help\norganizing, overseeing the\noperation of traditional public\ntransport and coordinating the\nintegration of BRT with traditional public transport, functioning as the feeder service.\nMoreover, the consortium\nwill allow the government to\nsubsidize individual management of public transport which will help the feeder service to have a more punctual schedule and to be safe and comfortable. This initiative can be implemented properly when the BRT institution is independent and competent.\nAction: Establishing\na public transport\nconsortium that\ncoordinates individually\nmanaged public transport vehicles\nResilience value:\nThe consortium can\nachieve a safe and\naffordable public\ntransport. Better quality and punctuality of public transport will help the\nusers to reach their\ndestinations of their\nactivities and reduce\noperational costs. In\naddition, it will empower a broad range of stakeholders to manage public transport and improved knowledge sharing between stakeholders.\nTarget group:\nPublic vehicle owners\nTransportation, Communication and Informatics Office\nSemarang BLU-UPTD, Semarang Development Planning Agency, private sector, Organization of Land Transportation Owners\nInventing\nB3 | Establish Kedungsepur Coordination Forum\nTransportation in Semarang is\na regional issue that impacts\nthe Kedungsepur area (a group of neighboring regions that include of Kendal, Demak, Ungaran, Semarang and\nPurwodadi). It is necessary to\nestablish a forum for regional\ntransportation service to discuss and coordinate the provision of regional transportation service. The upcoming challenge is the planned provision of BRT service by the provincial government.

It is necessary to integrate the regional transportation master plan with the land use plan. This strategy aims to create an effective transportation planning.\nC2 | Promote the Regional Transportation Master Plan\nC3 | Improve Public Transport Access to Tourism Attractions\nC4 | Improve Accessibility to Newly Developed Areas\nAdvancing\nC1 | Intensifying Development in the Planned Growth Centers\nKey\nInitiative\nTo prevent future urban sprawls, new development should be directed to the planned growth center stated in the Semarang spatial plan by considering high risk areas. Provision of new transportation service can be focused in these areas. The new transportation service can be built effectively with less cost. Moratorium for development in non-allocated areas is encouraged to reduce conversion of land use.\nAction:\nDirecting new development to planned growth center in accordance to the city's spatial plan\nResilience value: The\ninitiative will have a big impact in reducing people's movement which will lead to less traffic jam. Furthermore, the city can reduce the rate of urban sprawling and eventually decrease the need to construct infrastructure and enable a more affordable transportation service for the citizens. It could improve welfare by significantly decline the operational transportation costs.\nIn a bigger economic context, having less transportation time can increase the income.\nTarget location:\nAllocated development areas\nSemarang Development Planning Agency and Semarang Planning\nand Housing Office.\nDigital Globe\nAdvancing\nC2 | Promote the Regional Transportation Master Plan\nSemarang is growing to its\nneighboring regions in the\nKedungsepur area. Most citizens live in the hinterland and work at Semarang city center. There is hence a demand for a regional transportation system, which consider newly developed areas, as well as existing spatial plan.\nThe regional transport master\nplan for regional and integrated development has not developed yet. There is also a need for a\nbetter coordination and sharing responsibilities across-cities within the region. A platform to strengthen regional coordination among Kedungsepur\ngovernments is required.\nAction:\nCoordinating between\nKedungsepur authorities and the provincial government in preparing the regional master plan\nResilience value:\nRegional coordination\nwill generate an effective transportation service plan and ensure the\nregional transport link. In addition, it will improve stakeholder capacity\nby preparing the plan.\nThe good transportation performance, especially the regional one,\nwill boost economic\nprosperity as distribution route from and to the city will be smooth.\nTransportation, Communication\nand Informatics Office, Ministry of Transportation\nToll Road Regulatory Agency,\nSemarang City Planning and\nHousing Office, Kedungsepur\nauthorities, private sector, IGES, Digital Globe\nInventing\nC3 | Improve Public Transport Access to Tourism Attractions\nThe transition of strategic sector from industry to trade and service also includes the development\nof tourism sector.

Citizens prefer to live in these areas. New settlements grow with a sprawling pattern and not supported by good accessibility. This initiative aims to increase mobility, especially in areas\nwithout a public transport service as citizens are entitled to public service. However, transportation service and its routes must be\ncarefully designed to enable\nthe development of effective\ninfrastructure and service\nplanning.\nAction:\nDeveloping the possibility of new routes and transportation nodes that are integrated to the newly developed areas; exploring a smart feeder system which allows\nminimum investment and integration with the BRT system; exploring new\npublic transport route possibilities to connect the city center to the\ndeveloped areas\nSemarang Development Planning Agency and Transportation, Communication and Informatics Office\nDigital Globe.\nStrategies and initiatives of this pillar give answer to challenge in strategy and leadership dimension which becomes foundation in building resilient city\nWhat You can do?\nFind the Musrenbang schedule and location\nMonitor government performance at www. semarangkota.go.id\nVisit www.lOOrcsemarang. org and follow FB Semarang Tangguh and Twitter @resilientsmg\nInitiatives :\nA1 | Improve Mechanism for Pre-Musrenbang\nA2 | Increase Accessibility to E-Musrenbang\nOPTIMIZING MUSRENBANG (DEVELOPMENT PLANNING FORUM) IN THE PLANNING PROCESS\nMusrenbang is a development planning forum that uses participatory approach. Musrenbang is required by law to be\nconducted on every government level,\ni.e. from neighborhood, to sub-district\nand district and ultimately on municipal level. However, the implementation of this forum is not effective as it is currently limited by time and communal participation.\nA1 | Improve Mechanism for Pre-Musrenbang\nMusrenbang as a participatory\nbudgeting forum has a strict and limited schedule. There are only two to three months to conduct stakeholder meetings on every administrative level, from the\nneighborhood to the municipal\nlevel. The time limitation is a\nchallenge to conduct a good\nparticipatory process and\npropose high quality programs.\nThe citizens also tend to have a\nwish list during Musrenbang. It is usually focused on neighborhood-scale infrastructure that affects\nthem directly such as the\nsidewalk pavement in their area.\nThe citizens must be made aware of the overall visions and strategy of the city so they can provide a relevant and better proposal that can affect city widely.\nTo better improve the\nMusrenbang, there should be\na series of pre-Musrenbang.\nThey can support the\ncompulsory Musrenbang by\nproviding additional forums for\nstakeholders. This can increase\nthe participation of all citizens,\nincluding elderly, disabled\nand poor people. Both the\nMusrenbang and pre-Musrenbang should also be supported by\nproperly trained and skilled\nfacilitators.\nTherefore, the Semarang\nDevelopment Planning Agency needs to prepare a guideline of improved Musrenbang process and provides intensive technical assistance to facilitators in\norder to conduct an effective\nMusrenbang.\nAction: Informing citizens of the city's vision and Musrenbang process; promoting and supporting wider implementation of pre-Musrenbang; training for trainers for Musrenbang facilitators\nResilience value: A well designed and executed Musrenbang can improve the quality of city development program. It also\npromotes cohesiveness and increases the sense of ownership of local citizens by actively participating in development programs. Furthermore, it will also\nimprove communication\nbetween the government and public, and eventually reduce social conflict.\nTarget group:\nSemarang citizens, Musrenbang facilitators\nSemarang Development Planning Agency\nNeighborhood, sub-districts, districts, city agencies and offices, private sector\nA2 | Increase Accessibility to E-Musrenbang\nMusrenbang needs to be\nsupported by an electronic\ninformation system for enhancing the effectiveness of recapitulation and prioritization of proposals. In addition, this initiative improves\nthe transparency of information\nthat allows the public to monitor development process in the city, including improving effectiveness of budget use.\nHowever, the current system\nof E-Musrenbang can only be\naccessed by the government.\nPeople should be able to access it as well so they will be informed about selected programs and\nparticipate actively in supporting and monitoring the programs.\nAction:\nExtending access of E-Musrenbang to the public\nSemarang Development Planning Agency\nElectronic Data Management Division\nIMPROVING THE INTEGRATION\nOF PLANNING AND CITY BUDGETING\nInitiatives :\nB1 | Improve the Capacity of City Planning and Budgeting Personnel\nB2 | Integrate Planning and City Budgeting\nB3 | Improve the Documentation and Publication of City Program\nThere is an increase in the city revenue\nalthough most of it comes from the national\nbudget. However, the budget is not matched\nby an effective implementation, with high value of unspent budget at the end of year. This reflects the weakness in the management of human resources. Underspent budget equals not optimized service for the citizens. The encouragement of the integration of planning and city budgeting can address this issue. It also requires some improvement in leadership.\nB4 | Improve Budget Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation\nB1 | Improve the Capacity of City Planning and Budgeting Personnel\nPlanning and city budgeting play an important role in determining the quality of city programs.\nThe effectiveness and quality of\nprogram implementation depend on the quality of the planning and city budgeting.\nIt is necessary to provide regular training and technical assistance for government officials to arm them with better knowledge in managing the city budgeting\nprocess from the start up to\nthe evaluation. The training and\ntechnical assistance includes\nmanaging, monitoring and\nevaluation. The management\ntraining is required in order to\nprepare the government\nAction:\nRegular training, technical assistance and evaluation, involving some national\ninstitutions. It will\nmotivate government to\nensure their job quality.\nResilience value:\nThe regular training\nwill improve the\ngovernment's capacity\nand prepare them to be\nmore responsive to new\nchallenges. Qualified\npersonnel will lead to a\nbetter strategy planning\nand foster a long-term\nintegrated planning.\nTarget group:\nLocal government\nRegional finance agency\nSemarang Development Planning Agency, universities, national training institutions\nB2 | Integrate Planning and City Budgeting\nInternal communication between\nall city agencies and offices\nmust be improved to harmonize city budget planning. It requires having representatives from\nall city agencies and offices.\nCoordination between different agencies and offices is part\nof efforts to achieve the city's vision and avoid any abuse of authority and encourage resource sharing. Citizens' input should be considered in planning and city budgeting.\nIntegrated information system should include a citizen report\nmechanism. This system will\nencourage a good coordination between stakeholders. Citizen report mechanism has been developed by platform partner Ushahidi working together with Hysteria, a local community that deals with city issues. It has a potential to be integrated into the current information system developed by the local government.\nAction:\nStrengthening the local government forum; developing an online information system on planning and city budgeting; developing a filter platform of citizen report\nResilience value:\nThe improvement in the coordination will encourage integration between stakeholders and enable resource sharing.

Transparency and\naccountability will improve\ngovernment performance. Annual government program should be socialized to the citizens regularly, for example every four months. The information is not limited to the type of program, but also budget and details such as physical design if it is related to construction. Thus, citizens can participate in the monitoring mechanism.\nThis initiative requires\ncoordination between all city agencies and offices, and it is possible to involve platform partners. This initiative can be expanded by collaborating\nwith provincial and national\ngovernment in order to\nhave integrated monitoring\nmechanism, minimizing social conflict.\nAction:\nCollecting, identifying and socializing programs in Semarang\nTarget group:\nSemarang citizens\nSemarang Development Planning Agency, City Public Relation Division\nB4 | Improve Budget Administration Monitoring and Evaluation\nImprovement of monitoring\nsystem is required to ensure\na more effective budget\nperformance and avoid a lower\ntarget. Sanction mechanism for\nprograms fail to be implemented properly or reward mechanism for well-performed city agencies can be arranged. For example, improving the quality of human resources is important and the Education Office allocates a\nlarge portion of the city budget.\nHowever, the implementation and budget spending are not optimal. Encouraging the stick-and-carrot mechanism can help city agencies to be more selective in allocating program and to better motivate them.\nAction:\nDeveloping a sanction\nmechanism for programs failed to be implemented properly and provide\nrewards for city agencies with good performance\nTarget group:\nAll city agencies and offices\nSemarang Development Planning Agency\n\" OPTIMIZING THE GOVERNMENT'S COORDINATION OF DATA INTEGRATION AND PUBLIC INFORMATION\nInitiatives :\nC1 | Increase the Quality and Capacity of City Information System\nC2 | Enhance the Performance and Utilization of Internet-Based Participatory Reporting\nThis strategy focuses on the government's internal coordination of data integration and information delivery mechanism. This aims to improve government services. Access to public information is the right of citizens. This allows citizens' participation and will help them to face shocks and stresses. The information includes subjects such as permit process. Comprehensive public information will ensure transparency, as well as ensure the permit given will result in negative consequences.\nC3 | Improve Public Information on City Permit Process\nC1 | Increase the Quality and Capacity of City Information System\nSemarang has PPID structure that is coordinated by the Regional Secretary Office and involves representatives of all agencies and offices. A regular meeting and coordination forum should be held to prepare mechanism details on integrated data\ncollection, as well as citizen\nreports. The forum needs to\nhave a more detailed explanation on how to integrate public information, considering the current one is still minimal. This forum enhances the already established PPID and improves the effectiveness of information delivery mechanism.\nAction:\nConduct a regular\ncoordination forum for\ndata and information\nmanagement; improving\nreporting procedures in\ncity administration\nResilience value:\nTransparent information\nand documentation will\nimprove the sense of\nownership of the citizens to the city. It will improve communication between the government and\npublic. Furthermore,\nit can promote\ncohesiveness and\ncitizens can participate\nin the development\nprogram planned by\nthe local government.\nTransparency will also\nencourage government to have a better leadership and more effective\nmanagement.\nC2 | Enhance the Performance and Utilization of Internet-Based Participatory Reporting\nThe local government developed a digital information system by building a website for every agency and office that will enable the citizens to easily access all information about city development. Semarang is also keen to progress into becoming a smart and cyber city. The mayor has also initiated an online reporting platform.\nHowever, some of these\nwebsites are often hacked and\nhave problems due to their\nlimited capacity. The transition\ntowards digital system requires\ncapacity improvement of\nboth the system and server.\nThis will accommodate all\nrelevant information. It is also\nrecommended to improve the\nwebsite's security.\nAction:\nIncreasing the capacity\nof city websites and\nserver; enhancing the\ncity website's security;\nintegrating the website\nwith citizen reporting\nfeatures\nResilience value: This\ninitiative strengthens\ninformation plan and\nprepares Semarang\nfacing the digital world.\nTransparent information that is accessible by everyone will lead to better urban condition. For, example, citizens can report a crime, which means the law can be enforced and the crime can be reduced; citizens can report environmental damages and this can reduce accidents and disaster impacts. This initiative can raise\nawareness since citizens can participate actively in creating a better place to live.\nTarget group:\nSemarang citizens\nCity Public Relation Division, Electronic Data Management Division\nUniversities, Semarang\nDevelopment Planning Agency, all agencies and offices\nC3 | Improve Public Information on City Permit Process\nSemarang Permit and Capital Investment Agency has commissioned a service center that provides information on city permit process. This information must be disseminated more widely through websites, social media and traditional media. Clear information will help the community to understand permit requirements so they can proceed with the application more effectively.\nCurrently, it is not possible to make all permits online and only limited numbers of permit are online. The development of online system will allow people to apply a permit from anywhere and at any time and this will reduce process time. Simple permit process will allow more investors to come to Semarang and enhance city development. In addition, the system ensures information transparency.\nAction:\nDeveloping an online permit system\nResilience value:\nExpanding development opportunities by attracting more investors while enforcing the requirements to prevent negative consequences. Permit tax can increase the city income. However, it should be supported by improved capacity and coordination of stakeholders in approving permits and following the land use plan.

One cause is the\nskill gap between job seekers and job requirements. Semarang is also changing their economic direction to trade and service sector, while industrial area\nmigrated to the outskirt. Semarang workforce must be ready and become more responsive in facing this situation. They need to be aware of market needs and required skills set by the employers.\nThe other issue is the workforce capacity. Most job seekers are high-school graduates or lower. Low qualifications create less competitive workforce in Semarang. Therefore, workforce capacity must be improved.\nA1 | Establish Career Centers\nAn online or offline career center which can be accessed easily will help connecting job seekers to institutions in need of labors. Data update must be conducted regularly working closely with the business sector.\nLabor force is a regional issue.\nMost labor force in Semarang\nis based in the hinterland,\nalthough some people living in\nthe center work in the outskirt.\nHence, information on career\nopportunity has to be collected\nfrom the city and its surrounding areas and provide more working opportunities.\nAction:\nDeveloping an\nonline database of\nemployment including\njob opportunities and\ninformation on job\nseekers\nResilience value:\nIntegrated career centers can decrease the number of unemployment in\nSemarang. In addition,\nit can reduce crime and\nother indirect negative\nsocial impacts.\nSemarang Manpower and Transmigration Office\nPrivate sector, universities, private companies\nTarget group:\nJob seekers, business\nowners\nA2 | Align Education and Training with Labor Demand\nInventing\nSemarang Education Office\nshould prepare a roadmap of\nfuture employment opportunities. This will prepare graduates to the working world. By using\nemployment market study\nand the results of stakeholder\ncoordination meetings, the\nstrategic economic sector can\nbe identified. Then, training\ninstitutions can provide training,\nespecially specific skills that\nmeet qualifications of industry\nsector. This initiative could\nbe coordinated by Semarang\nManpower and Transmigration\nOffice.\nIn addition, career sessions or\nseminars for high school students can also be provided. This is important since the early years of high school can provide an overview of the students' future and it can increase students' motivation in planning their future. Representatives from both business sector and academics should be invited to give a clearer picture to the students.\nAction:\nProviding consultation\nsessions or seminars on future career and higher education; providing\ntraining according to\nwhat the market needs\nfor high school students.\nTarget group:\nLabor force, high school students.\nSemarang Education Office\nand Semarang Manpower and Transmigration Office\nSemarang Education\nOffice, Community, Women\nEmpowerment and Family\nPlanning Agency, Central Java\nEducation Office, private sector, universities, NGOs, Save The Children\nA3 | Provide Vocational Training for Elementary and Junior High School Graduates\nThe shifting trend towards trade\nand service sector requires the\nworkforce to have a higher\nqualification. Unemployment\npercentage of elementary and\njunior high school graduates\ntends to decline. However, the\nnumber is still quite high, above\n30% in 2013. Most of these people work in the informal sector due to their limited skills.\nThis initiative attempts to help\nelementary and junior high school graduates who are not able to continue their education. Based on age, they are in the active work force category. Skill training based on the economic trend can be provided, which then provide them with more employment options.\nAction:\nTraining and technical\nassistance based on the market needs, work ethic training\nTarget group:\nGraduates of elementary school and junior high school\nSemarang Manpower and Transmigration Office, Community, Women\nEmpowerment and Family Planning Agency\nNGOs, Save The Children, private companies\n160\nPROMOTING THE VALUE OF PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION QUALIFICATIONS\nMost of the labor force in Semarang is high school graduates. The elementary and junior high school graduate number is also significant. Meanwhile, the number of labor force with a bachelor's degree and diploma qualification is low. The condition requires an improvement in the education quality of Semarang citizens. This strategy aims to help students in anticipating future challenges.\nB1 | Increase Access to Scholarships\nThe Semarang Education\nOffice is trying to help people\nwith low income to be able\nto do the 9-years compulsory\neducation. The target group is\nlow-income people with good\nacademic grades. The selection\nprocess of scholarship recipients should be informed widely and transparently in order to ensure it goes to the right people.\nThis initiative must be followed\nby integrated monitoring and\nevaluation system.\nMeanwhile, the percentage\nof college graduates, both\nundergraduate and diploma,\nis relatively low and stagnant\ndespite the numerous scholarship programs from the government, private sector and foundations. Information on scholarships\nshould be widely spread to high\nschool students in their first year, giving time for the application preparation. Information on\nscholarship should be centrally\nmanaged by the Semarang\nEducation Office and can be\neasily accessed by students\nonline.\nAction:\nDeveloping a scholarship database; holding a scholarship fair; developing a direct scholarship system such as \u201cfoster parent\u201d program\nResilience value: widely\nspread scholarship\ninformation will give more options and opportunities for students from\nvarious backgrounds\nto improve their\ncapacity. Furthermore,\ncapacity improvement\ncan help them to gain\nemployment and lead\nto better livelihoods\nand wellbeing.

Good education system\ncould provide productive and qualified labor. Most of Semarang citizens are high-school graduates or lower, which means there should be alternative ways to continuously improve their skills.\nEducation does not only come formally, but it can also be obtained outside the formal system. This will enable people who do not have access to the formal system to build their capacity and\nmaintain their skills.\nC1 | Promote continuous education service for people of all ages\nProviding training and technical\nassistance for people in sub-\ndistricts and districts of\nSemarang, and \u201csmart house\u201d and library will encourage them to always build their capacity more. Smart house is a learning hub on the neighborhood level where people can gather and learn from the available shared materials, such as books.\nBy providing books at the \u201csmart house\u201d and library, people will have access to information and knowledge. It is expected that the reading interest can be increased and eventually achieve capacity improvement of Semarang\ncitizens. The \u201csmart house\u201d and\nlibrary development can be\nconducted by different levels\nof government, through private\nsector's CSR program and local\ncommunity, while the facility can be managed by the city to allow book rotation system.\nAction:\nDeveloping \u201csmart house\u201d and library and providing technical assistance by\nstudents and volunteers\nResilience value:\nGood education service\nfor people of all ages\nwill encourage them to\nalways improve their\ncapacity and be more\nready to face challenges.

The key to strengthen our resilience is by building our capacity. It will only be successful with the participation of everyone.\nThis document acts as the initial plan to strengthen our city resilience and also in line with the Semarang mid-term and long-term development plan. The CRS enriches the city's efforts in building resilience by creating multiple resilience benefits from each initiative.\nThis city resilience strategy is an ambitious plan. Urban challenges are increasing in number and business-as-usual efforts cannot manage these unprecedented challenges. The identification of these challenges is a result of a thorough and inclusive process which captured stakeholders' concern and aspiration.\nWe will work on meeting the water and energy demand in a sustainable manner, creating business climate for new opportunities, preparing for disaster and disease outbreaks better, integrating our mobility system, increasing transparency of public information and governance as well as increasing the competitiveness of our human resources. Therefore, Semarang can achieve its adequate security, efficient mobility and good capacity.","ENTITIES":{"PERSON":["Kali Garang","MICHAEL BERKOWITZ","Kelurahan Rowosari","Semarang","Kelurahan Wonosari","Purnomo Dwi","Pedurungan","Santi","Keturahan Gunung Pati","Kedungsepur","Tambak Lorok","PRIHADI Alhamdulillah","Wiwiek Handayani","Kendal District","Musrenbang","Garang","Sukorejo","Hendrar Prihadi","Rendy A.

With a population of approximately 420,000, the city is blessed with beautiful nature, extending from the 1,000 meter deep rich marine waters of Toyama Bay to the 3,000 meter crest of the Northern Japan Alps, a remarkable vertical span of some 4,000 meters. Famous for its pharmaceutical industry and advanced city planning, Toyama is a vibrant regional hub on the Sea of Japan with a wide variety of industries complementing its long cultural and artistic history.\nWhen I had the privilege of being elected Mayor of Toyama in 2005, we set out to revitalize the city and tackle multiple issues such as the crucial challenges in Japanese society of depopulation, a low child birth rate and an ultra-aging society, as well as the deterioration of public transportation caused by excess dependency on cars, suburban flight, and decreased residential density in the city center. Through city-wide discussions and more than 200 two hour meetings with citizens, we devised a compact city plan to meet these challenges. Announced in 2008, our compact city plan, which began with the key element of revitalizing public transportation and then moved step-by-step to related projects, has achieved clear success in reversing suburban flight, rebuilding our public transportation ridership and reinvigorating the city.\nToyama was selected as one of the 100 Resilient Cities in December 2014. Under the direction of CRO Dr. Joseph Runzo-lnada we have re-examined and realigned current city development policies within a future resilience framework and vision for sustainable development and natural and manmade crisis management, based on strong cooperation from a broad range of stakeholders and NGOs and IGOs.\nOur \u201cToyama Resilience Strategy\u201d, the first of its kind in Japan under the 100 Resilient Cities program, will be responsible for ensuring cross-cutting approaches to city policies and strategies. The city will continue to robustly cooperate with citizens and the business community to create our future resilience strategies through our collective strength and we especially hope this can be a model for other cities.\nI would like to deeply thank 100RC and especially Michael Berkowitz for their invaluable support in this process. Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude to all our citizens, business partners, advisors and city staff members who participated in this strategy development.\nMayor Masashi Mori\nLetter from the Chief Resilience Officer\nThe success of Toyama\u2019s Resilience Strategy would not have been possible without the unstinting efforts of the many dedicated people committed to helping Toyama realize its resilience vision.\nOur resilience journey began in December 2013 in Marseilles at the OECD Roundtable of Mayors, where Mayor Mori and I presented the Toyama plan for sustainability. Afterwards, the Rockefeller Foundation representative suggested that Toyama would be ideal for the 100 Resilient Cities initiative and encouraged the Mayor to apply. At the ensuing 2014 World Cities Summit in Singapore, I met with Michael Berkowitz who generously gave me his time to (I might add persuasively) explain the intent and value of the program. We immediately assembled an application committee representing key city departments and began generating enthusiasm for the program.\nNo comprehensive plan for a city\u2019s future can be successful without effective, visionary leadership and I cannot say enough how fortunate Toyama is to have one of the most respected mayors in Japan, Mayor Masashi Mori. Now beginning his fourth consecutive 4-year term, it is Mayor Mori\u2019s inspirational compact city vision which has laid the foundation for Toyama\u2019s success and garnered national and international acclaim. Among senior city officials, Vice Mayor Masayoshi Imamoto and Director General Shinji Honda have been stalwart supporters of Toyama\u2019s resilience journey. Among the many citizens who have participated in our resilience journey, we are especially thankful for the prominent CEOs and Presidents of Toyama companies, academic leaders and NGO presidents, who devoted their time and leadership to our Working Groups.\nlOORC\u2019s innovative conception of a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) has been instrumental to Toyama\u2019s success. Though I was the principal writer of Toyama\u2019s application to 100RC, it was entirely unexpected when Mayor Mori asked me to serve as Toyama\u2019s CRO and I am grateful to the Mayor and 100RC for this honor and the exciting opportunities it has afforded. Among the many supportive staff of 100RC, we are especially grateful to President Michael Berkowitz for his inspiration and constant\nsupport and to Horng Dar Lim, Associate Director in the Singapore Office, who has aided and encouraged us at every turn. Arup is our 100RC Strategy Partner and Laura Frost has been the key person helping us in the formulation and formatting of this Strategic Plan report.\nWe have learned from many cities in the 100RC network and I especially want to thank these fellow CROs for their inspiration and advice: Timothy Burroughs (Berkeley), Grant Ervin (Pittsburgh), Mike Gillooly (Christchurch), Jeff Hebert (New Orleans), Mike Mendonca (Wellington), Oscar Santiago Uribe Rocha (Medellin), Purnomo Dwi Sasongko, (Semarang), Sarah Toy (Bristol), and Kamlesh Yagnik, (Surat). We have also been fortunate to receive exceptional advice from representatives of 100RC Platform Partners, and I want to particularly thank Senior Director Tony Newling of Microsoft, VP Business Development Cities for Veolia, Christine Rodwell; Director Thomas Kessler of Swiss Re, and VP Dr. Ingeborg Rocker of Dassault Systems. As a World Bank Partner City, Toyama has greatly benefited in our resilience planning from the Bank and for this we are especially grateful to Philip Karp, Lead Knowledge Management Specialist for Social, Urban and Rural Resilience, and Senior Operations Officer Dan Levine, Tokyo Center, Social, Urban, and Rural Resilience.\nFinally there would be no Strategic Plan without the invaluable dedication and hard work of the thirteen members of our Office of Strategic Planning and Resilience, and there will be no future success without the enduring resilient spirit of Toyama\u2019s citizens.\nDr. Joseph Runzo-lnada\nCRO Toyama City\nHead of Strategic Planning and Resilience\nLetter from the President, 100 Resilient Cities\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate the city of Toyama and Mayor Mori, on the release of the city\u2019s Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for the city and 100 RC\u2019s partnership with it. This document builds on Toyama pioneering past efforts as it lays out an extraordinary vision of urban resilience for its future. Importantly, this Strategy is also a first for Japan and we hope it will serve to inspire other cities in this great nation to learn from Toyama\u2019s example and work to build a more resilient future.\nSet between sea and sky, along the Sea of Japan and the Northern Japanese Alps, Toyama boasts a rich environmental heritage along with its storied cultural and artistic traditions. It also has a history of having to overcome immense challenges and recreating itself into the modern technological hub it is today.\nAs it contends with its current shocks, such as flooding, and the severe stresses relating to its aging population, low birth rate, and resulting reduced tax base, Toyama draws on this past of perseverance and regeneration.\nToyama\u2019s Strategy makes its people and history central to its resilience and to the four elements around which the city\u2019s resilience is structured: Resilient Infrastructure; Resilient Prosperity; Resilient People; and Resilient Environment. Together they form an inter-systemic blueprint for a vibrant future, which address the city\u2019s environmental and demographic shocks and stresses, such as improvement to public transportation to improve accessibility for all residents; preservation of rural and agricultural communities; upgrade and seismic retrofits of community centers; creating a human resources bank to facilitate employment of senior citizen retirees; and promoting an active cultural and artistic life for all citizens; among many others. The four elements complement one another, and truly reflect the need to plan holistically to create meaningful resilience.\nThrough the commitment and leadership of Mayor Mori and Chief Resilience Officer Dr. Runzo-lnada, the city has already begun the hard work of institutionalizing resilience. With a robust resilience program that incorporates resilience into strategic planning for the city, and the full political support of all city sectors.\nExtensive engagement with the business and NGO community have also laid the foundation for successful implementation, and for enriching the lives of all who live in Toyama. Long ago, the city recognized the opportunities it could unlock through collaboration with the private sector, especially as it builds towards a future of growth and shared prosperity.\nThrough his energetic leadership in Toyama, and the 100RC network, Dr. Runzo-lnada has guided the city to this major moment. His collaboration with other CROs and partners in the 100RC network have already proven that Toyama will be a major part of the urban resilience movement to realizing real change world-wide.\nThough this strategy represents the end of the strategic planning process in Toyama, it is only the beginning of the exciting work to come in the months and years ahead. And 100 Resilient Cities\u2019 partnership with the city is also just beginning. It is now that we can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively impact the lives of all of those who call Toyama home.\nMichael Berkowitz\nPresident, 100 Resilient Cities\nToyama\u2019s Resilience Vision\nToyama is recognized by the Japanese national government and by international organizations like 100 Resilient Cities, The World Bank, OECD and the United Nations as a leading model for city resilience. The stated goal of the Mayor is to make Toyama a truly resilient city for our citizens and to help others as they create their own resilience cities. The underlying lesson is that Toyama\u2019s success is fundamentally not about policies, priorities or programs; it is about nurturing the resilient spirit of its citizens. For Toyama, resilience is a social journey begun long ago and directed toward future generations. We owe an immeasurable debt to our ancestors, rejoice in the resilient spirit of our citizens, and dedicate ourselves to secure opportunities for self-realization for all citizens and future generations.\nWe have created a long range Resilience Strategy by building on the policies Toyama has developed since its inception as the new city of Toyama in 2007, and drawing on the past and present resilient spirit of our people. This strategy was created with the invaluable help of the 100 Resilient Cities program, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation.\nThis report details the background, challenges, development process, vision, aspirations and specific initiatives of our Resilience Strategy. In terms of policies, this report emphasizes certain policy areas such as the four areas specifically first recognized by The World Bank when Toyama became the first sub national government entity to sign an individual MOU Partnership with the Bank: Compact City Design, Waste Management, Flood Control, and the challenges of a rapidly Aging Population. But beyond specific policies, initiatives or mechanisms, this report will attempt to capture something of the communal spirit, social outlook, and management style which form the resilience backbone underlying the past, present, and any future success of those specific policies, initiatives or mechanisms in Toyama.\nLocated on the Japanese main island of Honshu and extending from the Sea of Japan to the crest of the Northern Japan Alps, Toyama is a thriving high tech city surrounded by and infused with nature. Present day Toyama was created from the remarkably successful merger of 7 former municipalities with urban, suburban and rural populations. Deeply embedded in the city and citizens\u2019 identity is both a deep, Japanese sense of nature\u2019s sacredness and the centrality of agricultural and rural lands. Regarding the latter, our understanding of the importance of a robust relationship between rural and urban especially benefited from discussions with Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, Senior Director of the World Bank\u2019s Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice.\nWith an ancient cultural and artistic heritage and deep interpersonal and community bonds, Toyama Vision 2050 emphasizes \u201cCommunity, Nature and Innovation for the Future\u201d and the critical balance of essential elements which must be maintained to nurture an enduring and resilient Toyama.\nThe Toyama vision is:\nto be a vibrant city of innovation and a tourism gateway, a model of resilience and environment-friendly living, where strong community bonds help citizens flourish, and the high quality of an active lifestyle for all its residents achieves a harmonious balance between traditional arts and modern technology and between economic prosperity and the inspiring natural surroundings of the pristine Northern Japan Alps.\nHow do we realize this vision? What are the constituent policies and actions we need? What challenges must be overcome? What are the resources and best practices which will enable us to achieve our goals?\nToyama's Resilience Vision\nI. Executive Summary\nToyama\u2019s Resilient DNA\nEssential Elements of Resilient Toyama\nViewed as a living organism, Resilient Toyama has four integral, organically connected elements in its city DNA, each with a subordinate vision, which create a logical structure for our comprehensive Resilience Strategy.\nResilient People\nThe Toyama Vision for People is to continue to develop and promote a flourishing, mutually supportive community for all generations. Japanese culture has three interrelated ideas which are important for understanding this. In descending order of importance, one should first engage in jijyo, self help, then seek kyojyo, mutual help, and finally turn to kojyo, public help. For example, with our rapidly aging society we try to enable our seniors to live active, independent lives. They in turn can support younger people with families, who in turn support our seniors. This strengthens social bonds, enhances civic pride, and increases opportunities for self-realization regardless of age, gender or disability. This is Toyama\u2019s social vision of self support and mutual support which will be passed on to the next generation.\nResilient Infrastructure\nThe Toyama Vision for Infrastructure is a sustainable infrastructure network connecting and enhancing urban, suburban and rural areas to support citizen self realization. The heart of Toyama\u2019s infrastructure vision is the sustainable compact city which includes social as well as transportation infrastructures.\nThis integrates disaster risk management into a labor and cost saving IT and ICT technology-driven infrastructure through public-private collaborations, radiating reciprocally from the central city throughout the regional hubs and agricultural and rural areas.\nResilient Prosperity\nThe Toyama Vision for Prosperity is an\nentrepreneurial and flexible response to demographic change and the needs of every generation of citizens. While continuing to enhance its current strengths in the IT, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, Toyama\u2019s innovative promotion of advanced technology industries such as aviation nanotechnology, robotics, and bio technology, creation of start-up incubators, and the infrastructure modifications and city promotion drive to grow the tourism industry, will attract industries, create jobs, engage young people, and provide opportunities for seniors who wish to continue working.\nResilient Environment\nThe Toyama Vision for the Environment is a harmonious balance between human health, animal health and the health of Toyama\u2019s bountiful nature. This comprises two aspects, each reflecting a different though complementary value and ethical stance: environmental management (human health) and environmental conservation (the health of nature and animals for their own sake). Working with international organizations like UNEP, NOWPAP, SEforALL, IUCN and IGES, Toyama will continue to vigorously support eco-friendly socio-economic practices, efficient waste management systems, green industries and long range conservation plans.\n15\nToyama\u2019s Resilience Challenge\nToyama\u2019s major resilience challenges are generated primarily by demographic and geographic forces, as well as the inevitable forces of deterioration and aging.\nEven though it is blessed with rich supplies of food and water, social stability, an extraordinarily low crime rate, a negligible threat of terrorism, full employment, a diverse economy, the highest home ownership in Japan, temperate weather, and clean air and pure water, Toyama faces acute resilience challenges. Following the 100RC categorizations, these challenges can be divided into \u201cshocks\u201d and \u201cstresses\u201d:\nA shock is a sudden, acute event that occurs infrequently, such as a major flood, earthquake or disease pandemic. A stress is a chronic condition that gradually weakens the city\u2019s fabric on a daily or cyclical basis, such as high rates of unemployment, severe traffic congestion or social inequalities.\nHere is a snapshot of Toyama\u2019s major stresses and shocks which are detailed in the body of this report.\nThe single greatest resilience challenge Toyama faces is the stress of Japan\u2019s rapidly aging and declining population. The steep reduction in the percentage of wage earners as medical costs for the aged rapidly increase puts enormous pressure on the city\u2019s budget and ability to maintain a high level of city social\nservices. Consequently economic resilience becomes another challenging stress. And the greatest shock the city faces is flooding. While more than 100 years of constructing sophisticated flood control systems has reduced the historic threat of catastrophic snowmelt river flooding, the new threat of global warming has caused an increased frequency of torrential rain occurrences, overwhelming what were once adequate drainage systems.\nAt the same time Toyama also faces the challenge of preserving the exceptional quality of its natural and human made assets. Environmental standards are high and the environment unusually clean, but diligence and evolving methods are required to maintain and improve the quality of the environment and the conservation of nature. Likewise, social cohesion and community bonds are strong but these wither without nourishment. And the multifaceted public transportation system is exemplary, but aging bridges, older rail lines, and new provisions for electric vehicles and bicycle sharing need constant attention.\nResilience Outlook\nThroughout this process we developed a new perspective for the municipal government of seeing policies and planning through the lens of resilience.\nThis is reflected in the Resilience Strategy and rooted in the shared resilience vision flowing from the Mayor through the CRO and Office of Strategic Planning and Resilience and throughout the City Departments. While the Strategy has a large number of initiatives\nand sub initiatives, it is fundamentally flexible to account for new contingencies and new challenges. Most of all, though, the flexibility and resilience success of our Resilience Strategy does not depend on the refinements and complexities of systems, policies and initiatives, but on its organic foundation: the resilient spirit and community bonds of Toyama\u2019s citizens which have overcome the great challenges of the past and will make possible a resilient future.\nII. Resilient Toyama\nCity Facts\nLocated 260 km (160 miles) from Tokyo on the Sea of Japan, Toyama sits on an alluvial plain at the base of the Northern Japan Alps, facing Korea, China and Russia. \u201cToyama ( gill)\u201d means \u201crich with mountains\u201d (\u201ctomi ( g )\u201d rich, \u201cyama ( LU )\u201d mountains). Toyama stretches south from the historic shipping port of Iwase on the Japan Sea - home of Toyama\u2019s prized premium seafood - to the historic mountain town of Yatsuo and the stunning 3000 meter (9840 feet) crest of the Northern Japan Alps, only 34 kilometers from the city center.\nA thriving high tech city, Toyama is one of Japan\u2019s leading ecological cities and serves as a gateway to the mountains where Japanese alpine climbing originated and the famed Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine trekking route begins. The mountains above Toyama frequently have the highest recorded snowfall in the world and Toyama\u2019s famed snow-melt city water has won the Monde de Selection Grand Gold and Gold awards for taste and purity 6 consecutive times since 2012.\nFrom the 1200 meter deep, rich waters of Toyama Bay, 156 species of fish and shell fish are caught, making it one of the greatest fisheries in Japan. Toyama seafood is an integral part of \u201cwashoku\u201d, the traditional Japanese cuisine, which UNESCO has designated one of the world\u2019s cultural assets. In the washoku tradition of Japanese hospitality, the service is intimately personal, infinite care is taken in the preparation of the various dishes, and the final result is an artistic feast for all five senses. This is the essence of Japanese culture.\nModern Roots in Traditional Society\nTo comprehend the citizen vitality underlying the four elements of Toyama\u2019s resilience DNA, we must look to the nexus of Toyama\u2019s geology, location, history, and cultural traditions. Historically secluded by formidable mountain passes and difficult seas, and relatively protected from central government interference, Toyama was ideally placed to harbor new ideas, develop entrepreneurial attitudes, and evolve strong social bonds - all vital attributes grounding its citizen\u2019s resilience.\nOne of the three sacred mountains of Japan, Mt. Tateyama, rises directly behind the city and attracted religious pilgrims for 800 years from all over Japan.\nIn the feudal period the castle town of Toyama was strategically important, located on the trade routes along the Japan Sea, and dominated the rich rice fields of the Toyama Plain. Even Basho, the founder\nof haiku poetry, visited the region on his trip to the \u201cdeep north\u201d.\nIn 1690 the feudal lord of Toyama, Masatoshi Maeda, used a medicinal preparation from Toyama to cure the chronic stomach pain of a powerful central government lord in Edo Castle (present day Tokyo). The story of the cure spread and requests came in from all over Japan for medicine. Toyama became known as \u201cThe City of Medicine\u201d and Toyama\u2019s medicine peddlers delivered medicine all over Japan, becoming the basis of Toyama\u2019s modern pharmaceutical industry and eventually its glass art community after glass was first used to hold medicines. The entrepreneurial spirit, resilience in the face of extreme conditions, and the strong cultural bonds, developed during these earlier periods have served the people of Toyama well.\nWith its wooden structures preserved today, the beautiful hill town of Yatsuo was once a thriving center of silk production and Japanese papermaking, and the 300 year old Harvest Wind Festival in Yatsuo is one of the most famous festivals in Japan.\nToyama Castle, built in 1543, was surrounded by inner and outer moats on three sides with the Jinzu River on the fourth, enclosing a large area of 2.5 square km (1 square mile). Renowned as the Castle which \u201cfloated on water\u201d, after 1581 it was the keep of the powerful samurai Narimasa Sassa. In 1585 Hideyoshi Toyotomi, the great samurai lord of western Japan, attacked the castle with 100,000 troops and destroyed it. In the 1600\u2019s, Lord Masatoshi Maeda rebuilt the castle and his family ruled here until 1870.\nThe old port town of Iwase has carefully preserved 19th century wooden buildings, recalling its past on the sea routes from Hokkaido to southern Japan and\nChina when Kitamaebune, the traditional stout cargo ship of the 17th - 19th centuries, carried Japan\u2019s commerce on the northern seas.\nModern and Traditional come together at the new civic pride slogan \u201cAmazing Toyama\u201d, with the castle in the background and international Resilient\nCities Summit guests flanked by city staff in samurai costume.\nR\nE\nS\nI\nL\nI\nE\nN\nT\nT\nO\nY\nA\nM\nA\n24\nToyama in World War II\nMunicipal Consolidation\nWith abundant water from the Northern Japan Alps, the area\u2019s massive production of hydroelectric power supported the development of heavy industry. Producing specialized steel and ball bearings,\nToyama became the most totally bombed Japanese city in World War II. After being used as a practice target for four huge \u201cpumpkin bombs\u201d as a rehearsal for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 99% of city center was destroyed on the night of August 1,1945 in a massive incendiary raid by 173 B-29 bombers, many marked with a \u201cT\u201d for Toyama. More than 110,000 people were directly affected, 8,000 were injured and 2,700 lost their lives.\nRecovering from the war, the resilient spirit of the people of Toyama is evinced in the fortitude, gratefulness, and uncomplaining attitude expressed in the city\u2019s World War II Peace Reconstruction Memorial erected on August 1,1974. At the center is a statue of a Tennyo, or Buddhist celestial maiden, commemorating the hard work, great sacrifices, and enduring resilience of those citizens who created today\u2019s vibrant city from the ashes of war. Wreathed in traditional ribbon-like scarves, the Tennyo stands on the celestial clouds holding an open red lotus flower in the left hand to symbolize compassion and purity of heart and, with a young child, lifts up a prayer for world peace.\nThis is an enduring emblem of a people\u2019s individual and communal resilience which made it possible to achieve the sense of common purpose and dedication to create the advanced transportation system, economic prosperity, and clean environment of this formerly devastated city.\nAnother indication of how resilient communal bonds have served to produce results for the greater good is the remarkable municipal consolidation in 2005. To reduce costs, increase efficiency and transfer more administrative control to the local level, the national government of Japan instituted a program to encourage municipalities to merge, especially in rural areas. On April 1, 2005, seven municipalities (Toyama City, Osawano Town, Oyama Town, Yatsuo Town, Fuchu Town, Yamada Village and Hosoiri Village) were able to successfully merge into a greater Toyama City. The mayor of the former Toyama City, Masashi Mori, was elected the first mayor of the new Toyama City on April 24, 2005.\nThis consolidation of the original seven municipalities vastly increased the scope of responsibility for the administration of the new city. For example, the largest of the former municipalities, Toyama City, comprised 209 square kilometers and a population of 320,374, while the new consolidated Toyama City had a 30% higher population of 418,000 but covered 1242 km2, an area 5 times larger than the largest of the pre-consolidation municipalities. This presents both a management challenge and an opportunity for government efficiency, financial savings and greater resilience. But most importantly, this successful process of consolidation produced even more resilient social bonds to meet Toyama\u2019s future challenges.\n25\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAging and Declining Population\nThe most significant stress or shock Toyama currently faces is an aging and declining population which reflects the population decline of Japan, predicted to be approximately 19% over the next 30 years. The proportion of Toyama\u2019s population over 65 already exceeds 26% and is expected to increase to 38% within 30 years. These demographics cause critical stresses for social, financial and infrastructure systems, and directly affect multiple policy areas, including disaster response. An example of this cross-sector stress is the sharp decline in daily bus ridership, from 40,000 to 16,600 between 1995 and 2012. This was mostly due to elderly citizens going out less frequently and finding traditional bus lines more difficult to negotiate. The aging population also means increased healthcare costs. In our rapidly aging society, nursing care costs increased by 23% from 2008-2012. Also, the number of elderly people living alone has increased, which can leave them more isolated and, if they do not maintain active lifestyles, decrease their overall health and increase the city\u2019s healthcare costs.\nSome of Toyama\u2019s innovative solutions for an aging population deal directly with health and welfare issues, though they are fundamentally connected with solutions to other shocks and stresses. Two examples are the Kadakowa Preventative Care Center and the Comprehensive Care Center.\nProjected Demographic Changes in Toyama\nDeclining Young and Increasing Elderly Changes in Population Percentage\nThe Kadokawa Preventative Care Center is the first of its kind in Japan using natural hot spring water for Aquakinetics, and Physical and Hyperthermia Therapy. It is a public-private partnership, built on\nthe re purposed site of an elementary school using private donations and city funds, and managed by a private company. An on-site medical staff assesses appropriate therapy for each individual.\nThe Comprehensive Care Center, completed in March 2017, is dedicated to care for seniors and for young and handicapped children, and also provides daycare for working mothers with newborns. A public-private partnership in the heart of downtown Toyama, it consists of a medical center, culinary school and cafe devoted to healthy medicinal foods, a convenience store and pharmacy, a public gymnasium and\nprivately owned sports club, and a nursing school administered jointly by the city and a private company. It provides comprehensive support for a healthy and active lifestyle, helps reinvigorate the downtown area and provides in-home doctor visits and coordination of seniors\u2019 medical and nursing care. The Care Center was built on the re purposed site of a former elementary school.\nCompact City Strategy\nUrban Development Serving the Elderly\nToyama\u2019s compact city strategy, announced in 2007, addresses multiple challenges including the needs of our aging society, and its successful policies have now been incorporated into Toyama\u2019s 30 year Resilience Strategy. The Compact City Strategy has three pillars:\n1.\tRevitalizing public transportation\n2.\tEncouraging both residents and business to relocate to zones along public transport lines and building city facilities along these lines.\n3.\tRevitalizing the city center\nFirst Compact City Pillar\nThe key to the Compact City Plan is revitalizing public transportation. This not only produces efficiency, increases convenience for everyone, and reduces CO2, as the map above indicates, the senior population is clustered along the rail transportation corridors so these policies are highly beneficial for seniors.\nRevitalizing public transport has four stages:\n1.\tA new LRT line (Portram) from the city center to the ocean front\n2.\tA new loop line (Centram) in the city center\n3.\tIntegrating the LRT lines with the new bullet train (Shinkansen) from Tokyo\n4.\tConnecting the LRT lines to the local tram lines.\nBecause the central downtown Japan Railways Station lies at the center of a radiating rail network, by integrating the new 25 km LRT network into the rail network we have the opportunity to create a pedestrian-friendly city where citizens do not have to rely on cars.\nRevitalizing Public Transport -\nJapan\u2019s First LRT Network\nBeginning with Japan\u2019s first complete LRT network, our goal is to create a city where every amenity is within public transport and\/or walking distance.\nThe Portram and Centram lines are PPPs where the city provided public funds for renovating\/ constructing the lines and private companies run the service. Our Light Rail System uses barrier free stations, ultra low access cars and on-board attendants to aid the elderly. We instituted a 100 yen (90 US cents) public transportation \u201cgoing out ticket\u201d for the elderly, 24% of whom now have this ticket while 2,600 use it daily. The Portram line ridership has increased over two times on weekdays and over three times on weekends and the Centram line, completed in 2009, has seen a dramatic increase of 61% in elderly passengers.\nThe east-west aligned central train station was elevated so that the Shinkansen comes in on the third floor, local trains are below on the second floor, and the trams can pass under the station on a north-south axis. In our Resilience Strategy we are addressing the last element of connecting the north and south tram lines, integrating the LRT into the city\u2019s complete rail\/bus\/tram\/bicycle sharing network.\nSecond Compact City Pillar\nThird Compact City Pillar\nThe second pillar of the compact city plan is encouraging both residents and business to relocate to zones along public transport lines and building city facilities along these lines. This policy is illustrated in the graphic below.\nAnother key to our compact city strategy is revitalizing the city center. Because the city government has been consistent in carrying out our compact city strategy, this has encouraged private investment and many new commercial and residential buildings have been built in the core area. Especially notable is the new Toyama Glass Art Museum designed by the renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Built with the financial support of Toyama\u2019s business community and national redevelopment funds, and a culmination of Toyama\u2019s history as the \u201cCity of Glass\u201d with the largest glass art community in Japan, it anchors the downtown area, enriches citizen lives, engenders self realization through the arts, and attracts national and international visitors.\nCity Center Zone\n\u2022\t436 hectares in the urban core of the city\nPublic Transportation Line Zones\n\u2022\t3,387 hectares\n\u2022\tRail and tram line zones are within a 500 meter radius of rail and tram lines\n\u2022\tBus stop zones are within a 300 meter radius of bus stops\nIn 2016, 57% of the population is living in the residence encouragement zones, a 9% increase over 2005.\nThe Toyama Glass Art Museum opened in August 2015. A Public \/ Private Partnership, the building incorporates the art museum, the city library and a bank. The largest glass art museum in Japan, it houses a monumental installation by the renowned American glass artist Dale Chihuly.\nCompact City Results\nAs the graphs 1 and 2 show, the number of people moving into the city center, and the number of people moving into the residence encouragement zones along the public transport lines, has steadily increased and there are strong long range projections. Even though the total population of the city will have decreased by about 7.5% in the 20 year period between 2005 and 2025, as chart 3 shows the percentage of the city population living in the city center will have increased from 28% in 2005, when the plan was first established, to about 42% in 2025.\nIn the Toyama vision, compact does not mean that everything is concentrated in the city center. Instead the emphasis is on encouraging residents and business to locate along the transportation lines. This encompasses hub areas which were once centers of smaller cities that consolidated into the new Toyama. Hence, transportation and many city services are efficiently combined and compact, but all areas of the city - urban, suburban and rural - are served. And the rural to urban citizen\u2019s resultant sense of equal entitlement has become the underlying model for Toyama\u2019s resilience approach: careful planning and wide stakeholder engagement.\nShifting Population through Compact City Policies\nThe success of Toyama\u2019s compact city policies have set the standard for the city\u2019s comprehensive and integrated resilience planning approach of addressing multiple issues with one policy.\nFlooding\nNumber of rainfall events exceeding 80mm per hour nationwide\nWith the exception of the devastating bombing of the city during World War II, the greatest shock the city has faced is the threat of flooding. Two Class A rivers, the Jinzu and Joganji, flow precipitously down from the mountains directly through the center of Toyama to the Japan Sea on the north, producing the wide Toyama Plain of loose volcanic debris. The land is subject to the constant threat of floods and rapid erosion. In 1858 the magnitude 7 Hietsu Earthquake caused the largest landslide in recorded history when a 700m high section of Mt Tombi collapsed into the Joganji River above Toyama. Filling rapidly with melt water from heavy snows, within two months the huge landslide dam broke twice, generating devastating floods of debris laden water. In 1969 torrential rainfall caused massive flooding, killing many people, devastating homes, collapsing bridges, and isolating villages.\nAs early as 1906, now famous Sabo erosion control projects were launched to prevent landslides in the Mt. Tateyama Caldera and debris laden floods on the Joganji River into Toyama. 260 erosion control facilities have been built, including the highest and the largest sabo dams in Japan. Between 1901-1920 Toyama completed a second large project to straighten a major bend of Jinzu River in the downtown.\nMore recently, climate change has raised a new threat of urban flooding. A greatly increased incidence of torrential rain, which can reach 100mm per hour, has started to overwhelm the once adequate urban drainage system for downtown streets.\nNeighborhood Disaster\nPrevention Associations\nAfter the Great East Japan Earthquake, Toyama sent 300 disaster relief professionals to the Sendai area and housed refugees. This experience led the city to restudy its disaster risk management and voluntary Neighborhood Disaster Prevention Associations were developed. These Associations are composed of local groups of neighbors who have a natural tendency to look out after each other. By March 2014 the city had already successfully trained 385 Associations. These Associations are key elements in the city\u2019s ability to convey critical information about disaster response and to successfully implement emergency plans during disasters by helping citizens follow official evacuation routes and by watching over the young, infirm and elderly. These Associations embody the strong social bonds and a high degree of volunteerism which is an essential characteristic of the resilience of Toyama\u2019s citizens.\nOld River Bed\nR\nE\nS\nL\nE\nN\nT\n_\tStraightened\nJinzu River\nY\nA\nM\nA\nSince the 2011 East Japan Earthquake, the City has sponsored 765 disaster awareness lectures by disaster experts, fire department staff, and by Neighborhood Disaster Prevention Associations. The Associations have then carried out 712 drills. Directly involving these voluntary groups in the city\u2019s disaster relief strategies heightens citizen\u2019s awareness, builds a framework for disaster preparedness, and develops strong communal bonds for securing the safety of the elderly and most vulnerable.\n34\nWaste Management\nAward Winning Resilience Policies\nToyama citizens are proud of their scrupulous attention to waste, reflecting the Japanese adage \u201cmottainai\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t waste\u201d, with its Buddhist roots conveyed with a sense of regret concerning waste. If you go to a beach in Toyama, there are no trash cans but the beach is spotless. Executives of high rises will come into the street once a year to clean the area around their building and neighborhood associations have a regularly scheduled routine of each neighbor cleaning storm drains around their own house.\nOn the municipal scale, one important city waste management project is Eco-Town, a city supported industrial park housing waste-to-useable-product companies. The Eco-Town program was founded by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Ministry of the Environment and Toyama established its Eco-Town in 2002, the first approved in the Hokuriku region and the 16th in the nation. The goal is to advance city planning in harmony with the environment while promoting the local region as part of a \u201cZero Emission\u201d initiative that aims at ensuring that waste discharged from one industry is reused as a raw material for other sectors.\nWaste Recycling - Eco-town\nWith city incentives, seven different companies now turn \u201cwaste\u201d into usable products at the Eco-Town Industrial Park, started in 2002. An extensive waste recycling education center increases citizen awareness of the methods and importance of waste recycling.\nIn 2008 the National Government of Japan designated Toyama an \u201cEnvironmental Model City\u201d and then in 2011 designated Toyama an \u201cEnvironmental Future City\u201d. This was followed by a series of international recognitions and international cooperative agreements in resilience knowledge sharing, which also saw Toyama selected to host the G7 Environmental Ministers\u2019 Meetings in 2016.\nWood Waste Recycling\nFood Waste and Pruned Branches Recycling\nEcotown\nEducation Center\nWaste to Energy Plant (WtE)\n\t\n\ti\t...\t\t i\n:y Used Cooking Oil Recycling 'A\t\u20224^ 2S\"\tand Plastic Recycling\n^F\t\nV \"\u25a0 >\t-\t-\t4\t\n1\tHybrid Facility for\tAutomobile\ni\tPlastic Recycling\tRecycling\n35\n\nThroughout this process, 100RC has been an invaluable partner. The Resilience Framework helped our city staff and citizens achieve a more comprehensive understanding of resilience and a more precise understanding of which issues Toyama was better at addressing and what areas needed improvement. We were also able to assess the importance of Toyama\u2019s unique attributes in resilience planning.\nFor example, Toyama\u2019s natural setting is more similar to cities in the 100RC system like Vancouver and Wellington than to mega urban centers. With 1242 sq km of land from a seacoast to a mountain range, 2 major and 8 minor rivers and 70% forested land, and\nagainst the background of the Japanese sense of the sacredness of nature, our resilience strategy has a strong emphasis on both environmental management and on conservation, which have different ethical motivations. The former is primarily concerned with what is best for humans while the latter focuses on valuing animals and nature for their own sake. Moreover, the present Toyama City was formed under a national reorganization plan for formerly separate cities with the intent of incorporating rural areas so that the whole is officially the \u201ccity\u201d. Hence Toyama\u2019s Resilience Strategy addresses and balances urban, suburban and rural needs and interests and every system - transportation, water etc - is treated holistically as one integrated whole.\n\nDefining Resilience\nOne of the most crucial questions is \u201cWhat is Resilience\u201d? 100RC identifies seven qualities of a resilient city:\nReflective: Reflective systems are accepting of the inherent and ever-increasing uncertainty and change in today\u2019s world.\nRobust: Robust systems include well-conceived, constructed and managed physical assets.\nRedundant: Redundancy refers to spare capacity purposely created within systems so that they can accommodate disruption.\nFlexible: Flexibility implies that systems can change, evolve and adapt in response to changing circumstances.\nResourceful: Resourcefulness implies that people and institutions are able to rapidly find different ways to achieve their goals or meet their needs during a shock or when under stress.\nInclusive: Inclusion emphasizes the need for broad consultation and engagement of communities, including the most vulnerable groups.\nIntegrated: Integration and alignment between city systems promotes consistency in decisionmaking and ensures that all investments are mutually supportive to a common outcome.\nDuring our resilience planning process, and particularly our 2016 Resilient Cities Summit session with the World Bank, OECD, UN Habitat and Dr. Adrian Healy of Cardiff University on the topic \u201cWhat is resilience?\u201d, we found that the seven qualities are helpful and necessary criteria but not sufficient criteria of resilience on Toyama\u2019s model.\nThe seven resilience qualities are relatively quantifiable, a useful feature. For Toyama, some of the qualities which make the city resilient are not quantifiable. With its agricultural milieu and Japanese cultural setting, Toyama sees itself in organic terms. As CRO Runzo-lnada noted in the Dassault Systems Compass, the 3D Experience magazine article \u201cUniting for Resilience\u201d, on Toyama\u2019s model resilient cities are like resilient people and a suggestive\nparallel would be to resilience vis-a-vis athletes.\nTwo athletes might have the same \u201cmeasurables\u201d but one performs at a consistently outstanding level and the other does not. What is the underlying difference? With athletes we sometimes talk about \u201cheart\u201d, that immeasurable something extra of the successful athlete. Likewise for Toyama, it is essential that the city maintain strong civic pride (\u201cAmazing Toyama\u201d), exceptional community bonds, and a deep and abiding commitment among our citizens to self realization of oneself and of others (a Confucian ideal) - qualities of \u201cheart\u201d which are not fully measurable.\nThe pragmatic effect of these immeasurable qualities of \u201cheart\u201d help explain how the most bombed city in Japan in World War II could recover to become the vibrant modern city of Toyama; how seven former cities could peacefully merge into one Toyama; how urban dwellers do not look down on rural dwellers as \u201cperipheral\u201d; and how doors are often left unlocked, streets and public places are meticulously cleaned, and this major city still has volunteer firemen to complement the professional firefighters. They are also foundational for the consensus management style, unusually strong working relationship the city government has with the business community, our wide stakeholder involvement, and our drive for a long range city plan which supports all segments of society and all regions of the city and foregrounds the deep relationship between the city and the natural environment. Perhaps one word which best sums up the essential centrality of relationships to people and nature in Toyama is the Japanese phrase \"itadakimasu\", said traditionally before eating to give thanks to every being which made one\u2019s meal possible: the fish, the fisherman, the farmer, the cook and the server.\nConsequently, the initiatives in our Resilience Strategy incorporate the high degree of mutual support and volunteerism inherent in the citizen\u2019s self understanding and emphasis the arts as a means of self realization. (We owe CRO Sara Toy special thanks for sharing her insightful views on the importance of the transformative value of art to civic life in Bristol\u2019s resilience understanding.)\nIII. A New Strategy\nToyama\u2019s Resilience Strategy Development Process\nToyama\u2019s Resilience Strategy draws on a rich and diverse array of stakeholders and sources, including the city\u2019s already extensive municipal planning. A key document is the new 10-year plan required by the National Government and just completed in March 2017. Working with 100RC and our city resilience consultant team from PwC Advisory, we created\n1.\tA distinguished Resilience Advisory Committee of prominent CEOs and Presidents from the business community, Presidents of NGOs and Director Generals of key city government Departments, and\n2.\tFour Working Groups to generate new initiatives for our elements of People, Infrastructure, Prosperity and Environment, with a cross section of members of the business community, NGOs, municipal government leadership, and citizens.\nThe results of these discussions were added to that of the Mayor\u2019s separate Task Forces (e.g. on Working Women), advice from the Mayor\u2019s Policy Advisers, wide ranging discussions with citizens and city experts, and the city\u2019s various 3-year, 5-year and 10-year plans, such as the Urban Development Comprehensive\/Compact City Plan.\nOrganization Chart of Toyama CRO and Office of Strategic Planning and Resilience\nOrganizational Structure\nThe Organizational Structure of our Strategy development has six key components:\n1.\tA direct relationship between the CRO and the Mayor which is supported by the Office of Strategic Planning and Resilience (SPR) which in turn is directly linked to pivotal city departments.\n2.\tA Resilience Advisory Committee of prominent stakeholders to advise the CRO, SPR and Mayor throughout the process.\n3.\tWorking Groups of diverse stakeholders to research and develop initiatives.\n4.\tA consensus vetting process overseen by the CRO and SPR Director which flows from the city advisors and accumulated research then through the Resilience Advisory Committee, city Department Director Generals, city Executive Committee and Mayor.\n5.\tFinal presentation by the SPR Director of the Resilience Strategy to the City Assembly, which will be overseeing the city budget during the implementation of initiatives.\n6.\tThe understanding of all parties in this process that genuine and effective city resilience plans depends on all city policies working cross-silo and in concert toward the one goal of a long-term comprehensive resilience.\nThis process ensures that diverse stakeholders are already invested in the Resilience Strategy by the time it is launched.\nCity Resilience Framework\nStructure of Toyama\u2019s Resilience Strategy\nOur Resilience Strategy was created to both address the shocks and stresses facing Toyama and nourish the foundational resilient spirit of Toyama\u2019s citizens through comprehensive, integrated and long term resilience planning. The basic format for our Resilience Strategy is based on the City Resilience Framework (CRF) developed by The Rockefeller Foundation and Arup, which is also Toyama\u2019s official 100RC Strategic Partner.\nThe 100RC understanding of urban resilience driving the CRF is:\nThe capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nThe CRF helped us assess Toyama\u2019s resilience strengths, weaknesses and opportunities through the four main dimensions and 12 drivers of the CRF which help indicate what makes a city resilient. As the 100RC analysis points out, genuine resilience involves the capacity to not only overcome stresses and shocks but to learn from those experiences to be better prepared to deal with future shocks and stresses. This is a paramount goal of Toyama\u2019s Resilience Strategy, extended, as noted above, to our constituent rural and agriculture areas, and comprehensively directed toward sustaining and fostering the resilient spirit of our citizens.\nPutting the CRF together with our Resilience Vision, the Mayor\u2019s leadership and compact city vision, and Toyama\u2019s unique perspective on resilience, we developed Guiding Principles for developing our resilience initiatives:\n\u2022\tCreating a model resilient city\n\u2022\tDeveloping a comprehensive 30 year plan for resilience with step by step progressions\n\u2022\tFocus on four interrelated elements: Resilient People, Resilient Infrastructure, Resilient Prosperity and Resilient Environment\n\u2022\tEmphasis on self realization for citizens\n\u2022\tWide stakeholder engagement\n\u2022\tSpecific plans for the urban suburban and rural\/ agricultural areas which are mutually integrated\n\u2022\tIntegrated\/cross silo communication and cooperation\n\u2022\tEfficient, with the resilience dividend of multiple results from each project\n\u2022\tFlexible time line\n\u2022\tMaximum utilization of public-private partnerships and cutting edge technologies\nWe then developed four subsidiary Visions for the four integral and connected elements in the city DNA. These four subsidiary Visions, together with the city Resilience Vision and the Guiding Principles set the parameters for our comprehensive Resilience Strategy.\nThe Toyama Vision for People is a flourishing, mutually supportive community for all generations. As we support our seniors to live active lives, they can support younger people with families, while we encourage youth to support our seniors. This strengthens social bonds, enhances civic pride, and increases opportunities for self-realization regardless of age, gender or disability, a Toyama vision of mutual support which will be passed on to the next generation.\nThe Toyama Vision for Infrastructure is a resilient network connecting urban, suburban and rural areas. The heart of Toyama's vision is the sustainable compact city which includes social infrastructures, and integrates disaster risk management into a labor and cost saving technology-driven infrastructure through public-private collaborations, radiating from the central city throughout the regional hubs and agricultural and rural areas.\nThe Toyama Vision for Prosperity is an\nentrepreneurial and flexible response to demographic change and the needs of every generation of citizens. While continuing to enhance Toyama's current strengths in the IT, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, Toyama's innovative promotion of advanced technology industries such as aviation nano-technology, robotics, bio technology, and its infrastructure modifications and city promotion drive to increase tourism, will attract industries, create jobs, and engage young people.\nThe Toyama Vision for the Environment is a\nharmonious balance between human health, animal health and the health of Toyama's bountiful nature. Working with organizations like UNEP, NOWPAP, SEforALL, IUCN and IGES, Toyama will continue to vigorously support eco-friendly socio-economic practices, efficient waste management systems, green industries and longrange conservation plans.\nResilience Structure\nIV. Initiatives\nMajor Cross-Cutting Initiatives\nTo break down silos and achieve a comprehensive approach to resilience, we developed 10 major cross-cutting Initiatives. Each Initiative has an overall goal and specific sub initiatives.\nThe following sections outline the ten initiatives and 35 sub initiatives of Toyama's resilience strategy. They are summarized using the following icons to show how they will contribute to Toyama's resilience.\nNew - initiative or sub initiative which is new for Toyama.\nOngoing - initiative or sub initiative which is already underway in Toyama, but critical for our resilience.\nAlignment - initiative or sub initiative which builds on existing work in Toyama to increase the resilience value.\nExtension - initiative or sub initiative which is an extension of existing work in Toyama.\nl.A\nCreate a 30 year Smart City Plan\nEstablish a Working Group of city experts,\nrepresentatives from international, national and local companies as well as external experts in IT, to produce a long-term vision of a Smart Toyama City and articulate major milestones and actions critical to creating a Smarter City.\nPotential sub-initiative leader: Information and Statistics Division, CRO, Office of Strategic Planning and Resilience (SPR)\nPotential partners: INTEC Inc., Prof. Hiroshi Esaki,\nPh.D. Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University Of Tokyo, Microsoft Co.

During periods of extreme weather, up-to-date and accurate information is critical in order to inform disaster response efforts.\nIn 2014 the Jakarta provincial government launched its Smart City Platform which includes a flood map, called PetaJakarta, an issue reporting app, called Qlue, and a traffic management tool, called Waze .\nPetaJakarta.org was developed by Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI), and is an online map which improves disaster response at a city scale by providing citizens and government departments with live data on flood levels across the entire city. The map combines data from a variety of sources, including:\n\u2022\triver gauge measurements,\n\u2022\tsensor data,\n\u2022\tcitizen reporting, and\n\u2022\tsocial media.\nMaking use of Jakarta\u2019s high concentration of Twitter users, the system automatically interacts with users whose tweets contain the word \u201cflood\u201d (\u201cbanjir\u201d), asking them to confirm their destination and the current status of the flood.\nIt answers questions that are vital to public and emergency services, such as \u2018There\u2019s flooding nearby, should I collect my kids from school early?\u2019 and \u2018Which neighborhoods are currently worst affected by flood waters?\u2019\nThe system allows for a far greater reach and speed of data collection and information dissemination. The map and its data are shared amongst government agencies, NGOs and residents, helping to enable joined-up and improved decision-making, and speeding up disaster response times. Once waters levels have receded, the data can also be used to help prepare for and mitigate future flooding . The system is seen as a successful and low cost application of open data principles that could help other cities improve their disaster response systems and overall resilience to extreme weather events.\nBPBD DKI Jakarta Control Room using the Peta Jakarta map Photograph courtesy of Marcin Szczepanski \/ University of Michigan from the ODI website: https:\/\/theodi.org\/odi-s howcase-pet a-ja ka rta-rea I-tim e-flood-map pi ng-jakarta\n5.A\tDevelop a masterplan for revitalization\nof the city center to seacoast corridor\nDevelop a plan for integration and revitalization of the city center to seacoast corridor.

The city is only the 27th largest in Spain but has the second highest number of Michelin starred restaurants per inhabitant in the world (behind Kyoto, Japan).\nThe Basque Culinary Center (BCC), located in the center of San Sebastian, aims to ensure the continuity of cuisine as a center for innovation for the future, by providing expert training, promoting research and knowledge transfer between haute cuisine professionals and businesses. It plays an active part and a leadership role among the tourism offerings of San Sebastian, aimed not just at culinary professionals but a more general audience of food lovers.\nThe food capital brand is maintained through the various events held in the city. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) holds a World Forum on Gastronomy Tourism, started in 2015, in San Sebastian and will return to the\ncity every two years. Therefore the third World Forum of Gastronomic Tourism, in 2017, will return to San Sebastian co-organised by the Basque Culinary Center. The city also hosts an annual event of an international gastronomy congress, called San Sebastian Gastronomika. This is the biggest event of its kind where the world\u2019s most celebrated chefs perform. The International Seminar on Local Public Policies for Food Sovereignty was held in San Sebastian in 2016. This was an opportunity to debate and promote public processes which provide food sovereignty. The annual San Sebastian Film Festival holds \u2018Culinary Zinema\u2019, partnered with BCC, where top international chefs prepare a menu based on the films screened that day.\nGastronomic tourism can help the development of local economies, preserve local tradition, create jobs and improve other sectors.

This target was met, and exceeded, by the target date with 39,000 trees planted. The city council supported the schools by providing a plot for them to undertake planting if they have no spare land . Bristol City Council also covered the costs of the following:\n\u2022\tTree seedlings,\n\u2022\tExisting council staff to assist with the school plantings (including roles like community liaison officers, tree officers and parks and roads maintenance staff), and\n\u2022\tCouncil staff to talk about the \u2018One Tree Per Child\u2019 project and the importance of trees.\n\u2018One Tree Per Child\u2019 is part of Bristol City Council\u2019s tree plan. Children are being encouraged to play an active role in doubling the city\u2019s tree cover. Local tree planting\norganisations, native nurseries, horticultural volunteers and community groups have also been involved in the project.\nThis initiative was set up by Bristol\u2019s previous Mayor, George Ferguson, who said the scheme was \u201ca great way for school children to connect to the environment and their local community. As a child\u2019s tree grows, their commitment to the environment and their local community grows as well. \u201d\nThis initiative has continued with the current Mayor, Marvin Rees, committing to continue the scheme by planting 24,000 trees in schools, parks and open spaces across Bristol in the next four years . Rees has described the scheme as \u201can amazing opportunity to develop lasting change in environmental education, wellbeing and community engagement. \u201d\nThe initiative is replicable across the world, with the programme now starting to plant trees in Australia, the Netherlands, Kenya, Ghana, Mali and South Sudan.

We will also begin implementation of new resilience initiatives. We will develop an implementation plan for the first year with specific actions and outcomes.\nWe have already established resilience planning structures which will also be essential to successful implementation. The principal structures include:\n\u2022\tContinuity of the Mayor - reelected to a new four year term in April 2017\n\u2022\tContinuity of the position of Chief Resilience Officer directly under the Mayor - term of service aligns with the Mayor\u2019s\n\u2022\tFirmly established and budgeted Office of Strategic Planning and Resilience (currently 11 members) under the CRO, with civil service staff reporting\nto the Director General of Administration and Planning\n\u2022\tEstablishment of a Resilience Advisory Committee model comprised of city administrative staff, business leaders, and NGO representatives\n\u2022\tStructure for Working Groups comprised of city administrative staff, business leaders, NGO representatives, city policy advisers and Platform Partner representatives\nWorking closely with the Mayor and the Director Generals of the city\u2019s departments, the CRO and SPR will provide a coordinating role to support the implementation of resilience initiatives and sub-\ninitiatives by the relevant departmental teams. The CRO and SPR will be able to leverage resources to support the departments\u2019 work, such as the 100RC network and Platform Partners, and the World Bank and its Partner and Client cities. The SPR will work with city departments to monitor the progress of initiatives and sub-initiatives as they are carried out, and offer additional resilience support as needed in view of each department\u2019s progress.\nThe CRO and SPR will also oversee the Working Groups, which will be organized in specific resilience policy delivery areas in consultation with the relevant city departments and divisions. The Working Groups will offer advice to ensure our resilience initiatives and sub initiatives bring together the best knowledge and innovation in each area. Current plans are to establish new Working Groups for the following Initiatives:\n\u2022\tInitiative 1 Comprehensive Smart City (planning already underway)\n\u2022\tInitiative 7 Business Investment\nAdditional Working Groups may also be established for:\n\u2022\tInitiative 3 Water\/Waste\/Energy Management\n\u2022\tInitiative 8 Tourism\n\u2022\tInitiative 10 Conservation & Environmental Education.\nProgress with implementing the resilience strategy will be monitored in part by making use of the key performance indicators for each sub-initiative.

Our\nhistory is witness to the resilience of Jordan and\nJordanians and to\nthe fact that we\ncan accomplish a\nlot with very little\nmeans. It is a path\nworth international\nsupport.\"\nQuote from His Majesty\nAbdullah II bin Al-Hussein\nSince ancient times Amman has always been resilient with its people and\nhas been able to deal successfully with all the situations and migration\nwaves it witnessed. Today, Amman is a diverse city within the national unity\nframework, just as in its old history, the city of brotherly love: Philadelphia, its ancient name. As we join the 100 Resilient\nCities network, we aim to deepen our knowledge of the international model tools used to deal with the shocks and stresses facing today's cities which are characterized by population\ngrowth and climate change, in order to build and enhance our city's resilience in line with the directives of His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al-Hussein.\nThe city's resilience is a basic requirement to create integrated societies,\naddress the needs of their people and ensure their well-being. Therefore,\nwe found that this initiative is pioneering in terms of bringing together\nindividuals, companies, institutions, civil society organizations and\ninternational organizations to consider the problems and explore opportunities and initiatives. We used that as a basis to draft our first Resilience Strategy, which is different from previous strategies as it is inclusive and diverse, and joining 100RC network gave us access to learn from the best practices of other cities.\nAs we seek to put this strategy into practice, through implementation of its actions, I would like to thank the employees of GAM who worked on the drafting of this strategy. I would like also to thank 100 Resilient Cities network and the Rockefeller Foundation which supports this initiative, for helping us in developing our strategy, in collaboration with our strategic partner Arup and we look forward to more collaboration to build a better future for our city and its people.\nDr. Yousef Al-Shawarbeh\nChairman of Amman's Municipality Committee\nThe city of Amman and other Jordanian cities are facing major challenges that hinder their development and growth. These challenges arecompounded by the instability in the region. Water scarcity, power cuts, high population growth rate and migration, economic problems and unemployment, climate change, inadequate infrastructure and public transportation, rising traffic congestion, and other environmental, social and cultural issues are some of these challenges. Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) however, has managed to address many of them and has increased its services provision proportionally with the sharp increase in the population, which has more than doubled over the past decade.\nThis unprecedented urban growth and population increase have led to greater\npressure on the resources of the Municipality, affecting its capability to develop\nand grow. Thus, following the traditional ways of working will not produce the\ndesired results and will not achieve our vision of \"having Amman a city that is\nan organized, modern, smart, safe, attractive, lively, friendly, viable, proud of its\nheritage and its roots\". Therefore, it was essential for GAM to think of innovative\nways to break away from the daily work and to move towards sound pre-\nplanning of the city's future, to enable us to move from a reactive approach to\nproactive approach in the implementation of plans and initiatives according to\nthe best international practices. Our actions today will shape our city's future.\nGAM participation in 100 Resilient Cities network came following a call by\nthe organization;that Amman, with all its components, whether individuals,\ncommunities, institutions or businesses; is capable of confronting, adapting and\ngrowing despite the tremendous shocks and permanent stresses it is subjected to.\nThe comprehensive five pillar strategy aims to address all aspects of life\nand the needs of the city. It was developed with a wide participation by all\nstakeholders from both public and private sectors, local and international civil society organizations, youth, academia and others who met to discuss the city's future and draw a road map based on its potential. This strategy that we present to Ammanis, addresses transforming our challenges into opportunities to develop our city together and ensure the well-being of our people, children and future generations.\nThe strategy is a live document as the city is subject to periodic improvement\nand development in response to unexpected changes and future needs. We\nwelcome any additional contributions from our partners that further promote\nthe city's resilience.\nWe would like to present our greatest gratitude to the former Mayor of Amman, Mr. Akel Biltaji, for his faith in the city's\ncapabilities, his efforts to join the network and his continuous support during the development of the strategy. We also\nwould like to thank Dr. Yousef Al-Shawarbeh, who supported this initiative in his capacity of former deputy mayor and\ncurrent Chairman of Amman Committee. We also would like to thank all the employees of GAM for their active\nparticipation, as well as all honorable stakeholders whose contributions had a\ngreat impact on the success of our endeavor.\nWe would like also to thank the 100 Resilient Cities network for their support and for providing us with the opportunity to be part of those 100 other cities around the world in strengthening our capabilities and building the city's resilience, and finally to our strategic partners Arup for their sincere contributions to the\ndevelopment of the strategy.\nEng. Fawzi Masad\nAmman Chief Resilience Officer\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to\ncongratulate the Greater Amman Municipality, Mayor Dr. Yousef Al-Shawarbeh , former Mayor Biltaji, and Chief\nResilience Officer Fawzi Masad, on the release of the city's Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for the city and\n100RC's partnerships with it.\nThe cultural, political, and commercial heart of Jordan, Amman\nhas also grown into a formidable regional metropolis. This\nStrategy sets out a clear vision for the way forward, enabling the city to thrive rather than merely survive its various\nchallenges. Resilient Amman addresses not only the city's potential shocks, such as the refugee crisis, terrorism, and\nextreme weather, but also Amman's stresses, such as inadequate public transportation, water scarcity, aging\ninfrastructure, and high unemployment.\nThis inspiring document does this by placing Amman's\ncitizens, especially its younger population, at its center, with initiatives that create opportunity and allow for the city's natural talent to develop. With this as a foundation, we are confident that Amman can build a strong, resilient future.\nThe leadership and commitment of former Mayor Biltaji, and Engineer Fawzi Masad, Amman's Chief Resilience Officer, have guided the city to this major moment. This Strategy represents the beginning of the exciting work to come in the months and years ahead, including projects with 100RC Platform Partner, the International Rescue Committee. And 100 Resilient Cities' partnership with the city is also just beginning. Now we can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively impact the lives of all who call Amman home. From its early work and active engagement with the network, Amman is well positioned to help us in leading the global urban resilience revolution, especially by becoming a regional resilience champion and paving the way for other cities in the Middle East.\nWe at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these efforts and look forward, together with Amman, to create a new global standard.\nMichael Berkowitz\nPresident of 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation\nThis strategy sets out the vision for a resilient Amman and the pillars,\ngoals and actions that will help us achieve it.\nDuring Phase I of the strategy development process, we aimed to understand the\npresent resilience status of the city, through assessments of our shocks, stresses, and potential scenarios affecting our city assets, and most importantly through engagement with the city's stakeholders, including Greater Amman Municipality departments, private-sector, NGOs, universities, youth organizations and more. At the end of Phase I, we identified discovery areas or themes that we need to address to build the city's resilience.\nIn Phase II, we delved more deeply into the discovery areas and undertook a number of diagnostic activities to understand the resilience challenges, which resulted in identification of a number of opportunities, specific\npriorities and initiatives which will help us improve the resilience of the city. We\nprioritized these opportunities using the Resilience Lens tool, and with close\ncollaboration with our stakeholders. From this we produced a\nshortlist of opportunities that have resilience value and implementation potential. This\nstrategy includes the actions identified in this process.\nPhase I\nof our approach is all about\nunderstanding the resilience issues facing Amman. At the end of this process, we produced an\ninitial assessment of its resilience -known as the Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA), and identified\nDiscovery Areas, which are thematic areas around which deeper analysis and broader engagement was\nundertaken in the next phase.\nAppointment of City Resilience Officer (CRO) and Amman Resilience Team\nJanuary 2016\nPreliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA) and identification of Discovery Areas\nAugust 2016\nThe PRA was released in August 2016. This summarises all the activities carried out in Phase I. From it, five Discovery Areas were identified:\nAmman selected to join 100RC network\nDecember 2014\nAgenda setting workshop\nJanuary 2016 at Amman's Al-Hussein Cultural Center\nThe Agenda Setting Workshop was the first step towards the development of Amman's Resilience Strategy. The workshop brought together diverse stakeholders to introduce them to the 100RC initiative, familiarize them with resilience concepts, and identify Amman's critical resilience challenges. It was attended by around 100 people.\nEng. Fawzi Masad was appointed as CRO and the Office of Resilience was established. The Resilience Team was initiated to support the CRO in developing Amman's city resilience strategy.\nEfficient institutional financial planning\nComprehensive urban development Effective legislation\nResourceful environment\nRobust community\nA final cross-cutting Discovery Area was also identified:\nImprove Amman's ability to cope with sudden increase of population\nIntroduction\nDiagnostic activities helped us to understand how the city is currently performing, to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities, gaps in knowledge, and opportunities for collaboration and strategic action that could bring broader social, economic, cultural and environmental benefits.\n\u2022 Diagnostic activities were carried out to develop more detailed research and analysis of our selected Discovery___________________________\nAreas, in order to improve our understanding of the issues and uncover potential opportunities and actions that could be addressed through the Resilience Strategy. More than 60 opportunities were produced either\nthrough Working groups discussions, research, analysis, comparative analysis with other cities, or extension of an existing program\/action\/ initiative\n__already underway._________________\nField of Opportunity and Resilience Lens\nDecember 2016\nBringing together the findings of the discovery area analysis and diagnostic work, we used the\nResilience Lens tool to collate a list of practical, viable, resilience building\nopportunities that we\ncould realistically implement over the short and longer term. The tool helped us assess\nthe resilience contribution of the opportunities and their practical viability in the real context of the city to create the Field of Opportunity.\nDuring the Field of Opportunity (FoO) workshop, we prioritized the opportunities with the\nSteering Committee to identify a set of resilience-building, implementable initiatives to take forward in the final strategy, and identify our resilience goals. Five pillars and 16 goals were identified for Amman.\nDevelopment of City Resilience Strategy\nJanuary - May 2017\nFrom this we started to develop the pillars, goals and actions that form the basis of the resilience strategy. The pillars are:\n\u2022\tAn integrated and smart city\n\u2022\tAn environmentally proactive city\n\u2022\tAn innovative and prosperous city\n\u2022\tA young and equal city A united and proud city\nPhase II\nfocuses on a combination of technical assessment and strategic stakeholder alignment and engagement.\nThis information underpins the development of the final city resilience strategy. During this phase, the city develops its Discovery Areas into opportunities, taking into consideration learnings from Phase I and the PRA.\nThis results in specific priorities and initiatives for implementation in the city's resilience strategy. The strategy outlines the key resilience challenges and opportunities the CRO and city are committed to addressing, and the activities the city and its partners will implement to strengthen its resilience.\nWhat is city resilience?\nCity resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nAmman has adopted the use of the City Resilience Framework to help assess\nour state of resiliente. 100RC framework - developed by Arup and The Rockefeller\nFoundation - called the City Resilience Framework (CRF) helps cities to identify their\nresilience strengths, weaknesses and opportunities. Cities are complex systems\ncomprising multiple overlapping systems.\nThe CRF acts as a lens to understand this complexity and the drivers that contribute to city resilience. The framework is made up of 4 main dimensions and 12 drivers that together illustrate what makes a resilient city.\nShocks and stresses\nA city's ability to remain competitive whilst supporting the wellbeing\nof its citizens may be influenced by sudden shocks and ongoing\nstresses. A shock is a sudden, acute event that occurs infrequently,\nsuch as a major flood or terrorist attack. A stress is a chronic condition that\ngradually weakens the city's fabric on a daily or cyclic basis, such as high rates of unemployment and severe traffic congestion.\nQualities\nA resilient city also exhibits seven qualities, which should\nbe evident in the way the city - or any system, function or asset within the city -operates. These are:\nReflective\nable to learn from past experiences to inform future decisions.\nRobust\ncomprising well-conceived, constructed and managed systems, capable of withstanding sudden shocks.\nResourceful\nable to recognize alternative ways to use resources at times of crisis, in order to meet needs or achieve goals.\nRedundant\npurposefully incorporating spare capacity to\naccommodate disruption due to extreme pressures, surges in demand or an external event.\nInclusive\nable to create a shared sense of ownership in decision making throughout the city, incorporating the knowledge and perspectives of all majority and minority groups.\nFlexible\nwilling and able to adopt alternative strategies in response to changing circumstances or sudden crises.\nIntegrated\nable to coordinate work across institutions and systems to catalyse additional benefits.\n100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC), is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks -earthquakes, fires, floods, etc. - but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis. By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.\nIn December 2014, Amman was selected to join the second cohort of the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC). As a\nmember of the 100RC Network, Amman receives technical support and resources from 100RC to develop and\nimplement a City Resilience Strategy, including hiring and engaging a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) to work in the city government on resilience initiatives. In January 2016, Mayor of Amman, Mr. Akel Biltaji, appointed engineer Fawzi Masad as CRO, a new position created to lead city-wide resilience building efforts.\nThe importance of being in this network\nis for Amman to share and exchange\nlearnings from other cities globally.\nAmman and 100RC\n\u00ae ROUND TWO CITIES\nO ROUND ONE CITIES\nBangkok\tMedellin\tSan Francisco\nBerkeley\tMelbourne\tSemarang\nBoulder Bristol Byblos Christchurch Da Nang Dakar Durban\tMexico City New Orleans New York City Norfork Oakland Porto Alegre Quito Ramallah\tSurat Vejle\nEl Paso\tRio de Janeiro\t\nGlasgow\tRome\t\nLos Angeles Mandalay\tRotterdam\t\nAccra\nAmman\nAthens\nBarcelona\nBelgrade\nBengaluru\nBoston\nCali\nChennai\nChicago\nDallas\nDeyang\nHuangshi\nJuarez\nKigali\nLisbon\nLondon\nMilan\nMontreal\nParis\nPittsburgh San Juan Santa Fe Santiago de los Caballeros\nSantiago,\nMetropolitan\nRegion\nSingapore\nSt. Louis\nSydney\nThessaloniki\nToyama\nTulsa\nWellington City\nIntroduction\nROUND THREE CITIES\nAddis Ababa\tKyoto\tPune\nAtlanta\tLagos\tSalvador\nBelfast\tLouisville\tSeattle\nBuenos Aires\tLuxor\tSeoul\nCalgary\tGreater Manchester\tTbilisi\nCan Tho\tMelaka\tTel Aviv\nCape Town\tGreater Miami and the Beaches\tThe Hague\nColima\tMinneapolis\tToronto\nGuadalajara (Metro)\tMontevideo\tWashington DC\nHaiyan\tNairobi\tYiwu\nHonolulu\tNashville\t\nJaipur\tPanama City\t\nJakarta\tPaynesville\t\nAs a city that has grown rapidly and adapted to accommodate large migrant populations\nthroughout its history, we are already familiar with the concept of resilience. But as other pressures such as climate change, lack of economic diversity, and resource constraints increase, we are now facing new challenges for which we must prepare.\nThe following table shows the infrequent shocks and ongoing stresses that affect Amman identified by our stakeholders in the\nworking groups.\nACUTE SHOCKS\n\u2022 Economic crisis\n\u2022 Terrorism\n\u2022 Major infrastructure failure \u2022 Drought \u2022 Heatwaves \u2022 Flash \/ surface flood\nCHRONIC STRESSES \u2022 High energy costs_______________________________________\n\u2022\tWater shortage\n\u2022\tLack of natural resources\n\u2022\tLimited access to financial assistance\n\u2022\tMajor influx of refugees and\/or asylum seekers\n\u2022\tChanging demographics\n\u2022\tLow quality services especially in health and education\n\u2022\tUrbanization\n\u2022\tUnemployment\n\u2022\tLack of affordable housing\n\u2022\tLack of diverse livelihood opportunities\n\u2022\tTraffic congestion\/ lack of public transport system\nSummary of City Assets\nPHYSICAL (MAN-MADE) ASSETS\nWater: water plants, storages, irrigation channels, tanks, drainage, and storm water networks.\nHISTORIC\nARCHITECTURAL\nASSETS\nPHYSICAL (MAN-MADE) ASSETS\nGovernmental buildings and centers.\nHistoric buildings, archaeological sites, old marketplace.\nhil.\nECONOMIC ASSETS\nAmman's downtown old markets, new commercial areas.\nPHYSICAL (MAN-MADE) ASSETS\nTransport, main roads, bridges,\nsidewalks\/pedestrian walkways, bridges, bus stops, airports.\nbackup electricity network.

Recent snowstorms have paralyzed the city, affecting schools, transportation and the power grid.\nThe city has responded to these disruptions by establishing protocols for emergency operations, including rapid-response communications centers and elaborate community coordination processes.\nLack of natural\nresources\nncluding energy and water, also render the city heavily reliant on imports from the wider region. This leaves the city exposed to price volatility and insecurity of supply.\nCompounded by increasing demand from a growing population, Amman must find ways to meet its future resource needs without compromising its ability to deliver reliable and high quality services.\nRecent influx of migrants\nhas put pressure on the city's infrastructure and its ability to deliver basic services, this includes our waste management and transport systems. While the city has well-managed road, tunnel, and bridge infrastructure,\nthere is little in the way of reliable public transport infrastructure, forcing\no residents to rely heavily on cars.\nEconomic challenges\nRegional instability and a\ndifficult business and investment\nenvironment that discourages foreign\ninvestments have also contributed to\neconomic stagnation and a growing threat\nto the continuity of the city's services and\nsystems.\nWe will...\nA.\tImprove the mobility systems\nB.\tPromote walkability\nC.\tInstitutionalize planning in the city\nD.\tConnect the city digitally\n% Goal A:\nImprove the\nMobility Systems\nInadequate Mobility and Transportation system form a major environmental, economic and social challenge for Amman. The decline in attractiveness of public transport as a travel option led people to depend more and more on private car ownership causing chronic congestions and expand demand\non parking. This is not a sustainable solution and money and time consuming especially for the underprivileged\npopulation.\nGreater Amman Municipality has developed a Transportation and Mobility Master Plan (TMMP) based on information and surveys conducted more than ten years ago.\nHowever; this plan was not implemented for various reasons excluding part of the first stage of the Bus Rapid Transit system.Due to extensive increase in population during the last decade and the expansion of urban areas; it is essential to update the TMMP taking into account these major changes. We need a more efficient smart mass transport network\/ systems. This should include demand management measures, making the road network more modern, more responsive and thus more efficient. This work will be underpinned by the latest research carried out in relation to transport and congestion.\nAction 1.A.1\nDevelop an integrated mobility plan\nDeveloping an integrated mobility plan is one\nof the city's top priorities aiming at addressing traffic congestion, the increase in private car use, lack of mass transport and safe\npedestrian infrastructure. We will use demand management mechanisms and smart data to inform and operate the mobility plan. This will help us set\nup pilot projects in the medium term.\nAs part of the sustainable transport strategy, a series of key performance indicators (KPIs) will be developed and used to measure its\nsuccess.

Our hilly urban landscape has an abundance of pedestrian friendly streets and alleyways, but walking culture is almost non-existent. This is due to the lack of basic infrastructure such as safe sidewalks and pedestrian crossings. Cities around the world are moving towards promoting walking as one of the major sustainable and active modes of transport as a response to environmental and health challenges, and to reduce congestion,\nGHG emissions, and healthcare costs for both people and governments. We want to take advantage of our weather to promote walking for all, especially the most vulnerable in society. This will link with our cultural assets, adventure tourism, and the digital economy for the youth. We will find the right balance between pedestrians and vehicles.\nAction 1.B.1\nDevelop, review and update Amman's 'Street Manual'\nAs transport infrastructure is evolving, and\ncities becoming multimodal, including\npedestrians and cyclists, it is important to review and produce a streets manual that\nreflects urban settings. This, in design terms within cities, moves away from intercity\ngeometric standards for network layouts.\nWe will review and update our Street Manual to provide guidance for practitioners involved in the planning, design, provision and approval of new streets, including modifications to existing ones. This action aims to increase the quality of streets through good design, creating more people-oriented streets and providing a safe urban environment for all citizens including the most vulnerable.\nTimescale\nShort\nPartners\n\u2022 Ministry of Transport \u2022 Land Transport\nRegulatory\nCommission \u2022 Universities \u2022 Ministry of Public Works \u2022 Higher council for affairs of persons with disabilities\nOwner\nGAM (Roads Dir.) -V*\nStatus\nOngoing\nResilience Value\n\u2022 Provide guidance to city planners to design safe, high standard streets that provide universal and inclusive accessibility and promote a walkable environment.\n\u2022 Encourage active and healthy lifestyles, and increase activities in public spaces.\n\u2022 Support local businesses and boost economic activity.\n\u2022 Provide an affordable mode of transport\n\u2022 Encourage social interaction and cohesion amongst the communities.\nAction 1.B.2\nCreate a walking map\nWe will start by identifying a number of possible routes in the city to create a network that connects our neighborhoods. We will\nintegrate our existing assets such as\nRainbow street, the old downtown, the Citadel, the Roman Theatre, art galleries and others with the identified network to create an inclusive walking map for the City aimed at all ages of the population and tourists alike. We will provide the required walking infrastructure based on our revised 'Street Manual'.

Tactical urbanism interventions can be applied to streets, alleyways, parking spaces, and parking lots. Amman will work with the youth, communities and NGOs to temporarily reclaim space dedicated to vehicles to increase the vitality of our street life, create safe places for people to be active and social. We want to create meaningful temporary public realm spaces. We also aim to engage and learn from other 100RC cities who have implemented similar interventions.

Further, allowing diverse youth groups to explore opportunities for tactical urbanism themselves (for example, allowing youth groups to organize an activity within a municipally owned public space or activities to connect refugee youth with others in more established neighborhoods) may encourage positive creativity and serve as a way of promoting urban citizenship.\nAction 1.B.4\nOrganize a design competition for Amman's Hijazi railway\nThe Hijazi Railway extends from the most northerly part of Jordan to the south. It was built by the Ottomans around 100 years ago, with the aim of connecting Istanbul and Mecca. It is now one of\nJordan's most highly valued assets. It has also contributed to raising property prices along the route. Today, the Railway Corporation organizes weekly tourist and family oriented trips along a 10 km section of track using a steam engine and restored wagons. We believe this asset could make a more interesting and effective contribution to the city and its citizens. Using the New York City Highline project as a case study, we will organize a design competition to revitalize the railway as a major historical asset that connects the city, and as a means to engage communities in more active, green and open spaces in the city. The railway has the potential to serve as a social\/meeting hub, a cycling and walking route, an entertainment venue, and a green public space.\nOwner\t11\nJordan Hijaz Railway -\nCorporation\tAB\nStatus\nNew\nTimescale\nLong term\nPartners\n\u2022 GAM \u2022\nMinistry of\nTransport \u2022\nMinistry of Tourism\nVRes*ilience Value\n\u2022 Provide a safe, green public space,\nhelping to connect the northern and southern parts of Amman.\n\u2022 Bring communities together and support\nsocial cohesion.\n\u2022 Revitalize the city's physical and historic\nassets.\n\u2022 Promote walking and cycling, increase\naccess to green spaces, and enhance public health.\n\u2022 Attract investment and create job opportunities.\nInspiration from other cities New York Highline\nThe New York City High Line is a 2.33 km linear park built in Manhattan on an elevated section of a disused Central Railroad spur called the West Side Line.\nInspired by the 4.8 km Promenade Plantee (tree-lined walkway) in Paris, the High Line has been designed as an aerial greenway and \u2018rails-to-trails' park.\nThe High Line is a highly innovative public\nspace, offering visitors an outdoor experience unlike anything else in New York. The setting provides the perfect conditions for successful public-facing events, with visitor numbers reaching 60,000+ on the park's busiest days.\nAn integrated water drainage and retention system helps to reduce stormwater run-off while greenery provides shading and cooling, helping to lower the urban heat island effect. The park has also contributed to significant urban development and increased land values along the route.\nGoal C:\nInstitutionalize planning in the city\nAmman has grown from a city of 29Km2 in 1961 to a metropolis of 800Km2 to date with an urban area of 630Km2. This growth is a result of a number of factors including rural urban migration, concentration of economic activity and services in the capital but most importantly the influx of refugees from the surrounding countries especially in the last few years following the conflict in Syria which are putting pressure on the city's infrastructure. Amman's quality of life is threatened by the increase in traffic congestion, air pollution, reduced pedestrian accessibility, dominance of vehicular roads, lack of open public spaces, all compounded by the lack of strict urban planning. We aim to institutionalize urban planning in the city to allow for a sustainable growth for the future.\nAction 1.C.1\nFinalize and implement Amman Strategic Master Plan 2060\nWe will develop a comprehensive Strategic Master plan for the city that guides development and enhances\nthe quality and character of the built\nenvironment. The plan will encourage\ncompact urban growth to make the\nbest use of existing services, promote public transport use, improve pedestrian accessibility, create a natural heritage system that builds on the city's parks, forests and green spaces, protect the agricultural land, and promote mixed use developments to foster diverse economy.\nOwner\nGAM (Planning Directorate)\nStatus\nOngoing\nTimescale\nLong Term\/phased\nPartners\n\u2022 Land and Survey department\n\u2022 Royal Geographic Center\n\u2022 Amman Urban Observatory\n9 A, 11 16 \u00ab\nASIB\nResilience Value\n\u2022 Direct the future growth and guide the physical development of the city to the year 2060.\n\u2022 Promote integrated and sustainable development practices.\n\u2022 Protect and celebrate the natural and cultural heritage of Amman.\n\u2022 Enhance the quality of life through an integrated masterplan.\n\u2022 Help the city deal with multidisciplinary issues like disaster risk reduction.\n\u2022 Encourage economic development initiatives. \u2022 Support the public transportation plans and\nprojects.\nAction 1.C.2\nDevelop a strategic development plan for East Amman\nIn the short term, we will develop a strategic\tOwner\t\ndevelopment plan for East Amman to address urban sprawl,\tGAM (Planning Dir.)\t\ndirect, control and manage growth, and\tStatus\tResilience Value\nidentify new areas for development and investment.

We need to ensure that both help Amman function better. Jordan is ranked among the countries with high smart phone ownership and internet usage rates. Approximately 95% of Jordanians own mobile phones and there is a 53% internet usage rate. It is estimated that 95% of those aged 18-29 hold mobile phones in Jordan.\nWe aim to make digital technologies integral to the city's processes to inform an integrated approach to city planning, service delivery and decision making but also to boost our digital economy and create employment opportunities.

It includes events to suit all ages and abilities, including the\nfeatured 42 km marathon, a 21 km half marathon, a 10 km fun- run, and a children's race. There is also a\nwheelchair race and a special category for the visually impaired. The Amman Marathon provides the unique\nopportunity for\nparticipants to run through the streets of downtown Amman unimpeded by traffic. It only happens once a year! Finishers are rewarded with the glorious sight of the morning sun reflecting off the city's ancient Roman ruins,\nan unrivalled experience of great beauty.\nWorking with our partners\nInternational Rescue\nCommittee (IRC)\nrecommendations on the refugee crisis\nJordan is host to one of the biggest refugee populations in the world. The Syrian influx brings the estimate of total unregistered migrants (not just Syrians) to over 1.4 million.\nThe city of Amman has been a primary\ndestination for Syrian refugees. At the start of the crisis (2011-2012), UNHCR estimated that around 20% of urban refugees settled in Amman and, three years later, that share has risen to more than 34%. While no exact figures exist, UNHCR estimates that over 181,000 persons of concern reside within the Amman Governorate, though the actual number is certainly higher.\nThe IRC, in partnership with 100RC, carried out indepth research to understand the scale of the problem and make practical recommendations that would align with Amman's goals and\nactions in the resilience strategy. Interviews, site visits and workshops formed the basis of the process. Based on their findings the IRC made the following recommendations:\n\u25a1\nPromote an inclusive approach to\nresilience. The strategy should extend the\nbenefits of its resilience goals to all residents of Amman with an added emphasis on the sudden increase of population, including\nmarginalized and displaced residents.\nWe have added 'an inclusive city' as\na cross-cutting resilience theme; and\nadapted actions that address the specific\nneeds of displaced residents and host\ncommunities. In addition, we recommend\nincluding the development of an Inclusive\nResilience Plan; and pursuing opportunities to include refugee and displaced populations in\neveryday city activities through community engagement in urban development plans or environmental\nawareness campaigns and activities.\nPlay a leadership role in the refugee response within Amman. Using its relative administrative autonomy, the\nAmman Resilience Team can play a convening role in the overall response to the refugee crisis within Jordan. It should promote good\npractice at the local level not only for the response within other Jordanian cities, but also for current and future urban\ndisplacement crises globally.\n2 Develop an Inclusive Resilience Plan.\nThis may include actions such as: issuing an Amman Citizen Card to facilitate access to various service centers from both National, Municipal, and Civil Society actors while linking with the \u201cI Love Amman\u201d youth initiative and promoting a sense of belonging within Amman; developing an online platform to promote information\nsharing and feedback; adding humanitarian services to the planned coordination of services within Amman; sensitizing existing services to the unique needs of refugees; and designing an engagement strategy to ensure they are aware of and feel safe accessing services within Amman. This should have a particular focus on women and girls.\nWork through public private partnerships.\nThe Amman Resilience Team should network and collaborate with aid and private sector actors to address the immediate needs of displaced and marginalized residents\nby including them in resilience-building\nactivities and strengthening the long-term\nimpact of humanitarian programming.\nIdentify financing opportunities\nthrough foreign investment funding\nstreams. To finance the City Resilience\nStrategy, GAM should identify opportunities that currently exist through initiatives such as the Jordan Compact and linkages with existing Special Economic Zones within the Amman Governorate (i.e. those that are\nbenefitting from the simplified rules of origin for exporting to the European Union market). By working through public private\npartnerships, the Resilient Amman team\nmay be able to leverage the interest of\nforeign companies to support the\nimplementation of the strategy, particularly\nthose actions that promote inclusive\nresilience and contribute to the economic\ndevelopment of the poorer neighborhoods in East Amman.\nIRC's proposed recommendations to the actions in this strategy (to make them more inclusive of refugees\nand marginalized residents) can be\nfound throughout Chapter 3.\n\u25a1\nWorking with other 100RC Cities\nAthens Network Exchange: Cities and the Global Migration Crisis\nAmman was one of the eight 100RC cities that participated in a three-day Network Exchange organized by 100RC and hosted by the Municipality of Athens in September 2016. The Network Exchange provided a forum to bring together cities, of different sizes and geographies, to address the common challenges of migrant integration\nin urban settings. The forum allowed cities to connect with experts, share effective city practices and tools,\nlearn from each other, and replicate successful ideas. Cities were represented by their Chief Resilience Officers\n(CROs) and migrant policy officials, and included Athens (Greece), Los Angeles (United States of America),\nMedellin (Colombia), Montreal (Canada), Paris (France), Ramallah (Palestine), and Thessaloniki (Greece).\nATHENS EXCHANGE\nBy the Numbers\n\u2022 3 DAYS of site visits, presentations and working sessions \u2022 8 CITIES representing 7 countries and 3 regions \u2022 22 RESILIENCE PRACTITIONERS including 8 CROs and 14 city staff \u2022 30 EXPERTS from businesses, NGO, academia, local leadership, and 100RC Platform of Partners\nThe forum included site visits, meeting local organizations, and working sessions to understand how Athens is addressing its refugee crisis and moving toward a more holistic strategy.\nAthens Network Exchange\nProgram Overview\nDAY 1 \/ CHALLENGES\nThe day was divided into three parts. a) Scene setting providing context for the current situation in Greece, b) Global perspectives from the\nparticipating CROs on the challenge in their respective cities, and c) a panel featuring representatives of the migrant community and\nlocal organizations followed by site visits highlighting Athens' interventions in Victoria Square and the Relocation Scheme Program.\nDAY 2 \/ SOLUTIONS\nParticipants worked in multi disciplinary groups around the themes of infrastructure, social cohesion, and economic development, to arrive at best practices and new solutions to manage urban migration while building resilience.\nDAY 3 \/ WHAT'S NEXT\nCity teams synthesized findings from the workshop and defined a list of aspirations and strategic approaches to share with mayors, the broader 100RC network, and to establish an ongoing community focused on cities and migration to move the collective work forward.\nOutcome\nThe outcome of the Network Exchange included a number of Aspirations and Strategic Approaches that Chief Resilience Officers and other Exchange participants recommend for embracing the current migration crisis as an opportunity for cities to become more adaptive, cohesive, and vibrant for all their residents.\n4 Aspirations and 13 Strategic Approaches have been formulated.\nAspirations are the visions Chief Resilience Officers hold for the future to guide the way their cities plan for and manage urban migration\nStrategic approaches are actions Chief Resilience Officers recommend for achieving their aspirations\nPlan for a Dynamic Future\nBy embracing global migration and incorporating human flows into urban planning, adaptive cities prepare, transform, and thrive in the face of a\ndynamic future.\n\u2022\tIncorporate migration considerations into the design of\nkey services and infrastructure.\n\u2022\tEstablish a city-level office dedicated to the successful\nintegration of newcomers.\n\u2022\tApply migration considerations to city-wide plans and\nresilience strategies.\n\u2022\tDevelop more granular and coordinated data collection\nto improve integration initiatives.\nEmbrace Newcomers\nBy welcoming and integrating migrants, inclusive and cohesive cities become better places for all residents.\n\u2022\tPromote migration through a narrative that emphasizes\ncommon goals, values, and opportunities.\n\u2022\tPromote initiatives that foster regular interactions\nbetween new and existing populations to strengthen communal bonds and mitigate the effects of false stereotypes.\n\u2022\tAddress migrants' fundamental needs while promoting\ninitiatives that reduce real or perceived competition among newcomers and native residents.\nThrive Together\nBy valuing and leveraging the talent of migrants, equitable cities create opportunities for all residents and vulnerable populations.\n\u2022\tImprove access to financial services for migrants and\nother vulnerable groups.\n\u2022\tCreate opportunities for migrants to generate income\ndespite rigid labor markets, through cash-for-work\nprograms and paid training\nschemes.\n\u2022\tSupport immigrant-owned businesses and incorporate\nthe needs of immigrant entrepreneurs into traditional economic development priorities and strategies.\nLead for Change\nBy partnering with local, national, and international actors, leading cities create an enabling environment for best managing the reception and integration of newcomers at the local level.\n\u2022\tActively campaign to receive policy and funding support\nfor better managing migrant reception and integration in urban areas.\n\u2022\tFill in policy and funding gaps creatively by tweaking\nlocal mandates and leveraging public- private partnerships.\n\u2022\tLeverage and improve coordination - at all stages, from\nplanning to implementation - withhumanitarian aid agencies, NGOs, businesses and local organizations, to avoid duplications and maximize collective impact.\nFor Amman, the Network Exchange was both an inspiration and a validation for the content of our resilience strategy, and has catalyzed concrete actions to strengthen the role of our city as welcoming, united, and equal.\nLinks and learning from other 100RC cities\nThe network of Chief Resilience Officers provides the opportunity for cities to engage with and learn from their peers. We will use the\nnetwork to find inspiration for some of our actions and learn from the experiences of other cities carrying out similar activities or challenges. The following table illustrates some of the actions being taken in the 100RC network, relevant to Amman's proposed actions.\nIntegrated and smart city Environmentally proactive city Innovative and prosperous city Young and equal city United and proud city\n4.1\nStakeholder roles\nStakeholder consultation in\ndevelopment of strategy\nThe involvement of the city's stakeholders was\nvery important in the development of the resilience strategy. We brought together and consulted with stakeholders from different sectors of the city, including city officials, governmental bodies, NGO's, local communities, academic institutions, and youth organization to discuss our resilience challenges,\nand collectively develop the opportunities for\nour resilience strategy. This has allowed us to:\n\u2022\tGather different perspectives in the process of shaping our\nstrategy and the future of Amman.\n\u2022\tProvide the CRO with a solid comprehensive understanding\nof the city's current context and the opportunities to build resilience.\n\u2022\tBuild a resilience strategy that is supported and owned by\nthe city as a whole.\n\u2022\tEnsure transparency in building the city strategy.\n\u2022\tEmpower people to participate in the strategy development,\nand thereby activate the community and promote community cohesion.\nRole of the resilience steering committee\nWith support from the Mayor, the CRO created an interdisciplinary group of city staff and non-city government stakeholders tasked with providing guidance on the development of the Amman resilience strategy and other associated activities. The role of the Amman Resilience Steering Committee include:\n\u2022\tProvide advice to Amman Resilience Team on the content\nof Amman resilience strategy.\n\u2022\tAct as a resource to provide the necessary data and best\npractice for Amman resilience strategy.\n\u2022\tProvide social networking platform by representing and\ncommunicating with other stakeholders in cooperation with Amman city team.\n\u2022\tProvide guidance and advice to help Amman Resilience\nTeam to solve any obstacles or problems.\n\u2022\tMonitor performance and obtain the approval and support of\nall partners involved in the adoption of the city resilience strategy.\n\u2022\tAssist the CRO to develop a robust, actionable funding\nstrategy focused on achieving Amman's resilience priorities.\n4.2\nOperationalizing resilience\nOperationalizing resilience is about making\nthe plans proposed in the strategy happen.\nFollowing the release, we will start planning and preparing a detailed implementation plan in consultation and collaboration with the relevant stakeholders and partners. This also requires developing the city's performance to deliver these actions in collaboration with the city's stakeholders to work together, supporting one another to ensure objectives can be met and actions delivered for a more resilient Amman.\nAs part of this process, the Greater Amman\nMunicipality will establish a cross-sector internal development plan for all GAM employees to invest in our human capital, and support GAM vision and goals. GAM will also review and update internal\nmunicipal processes to simplify procedures and increase the efficiency of GAM. For example,\nproviding a services center. GAM will review and update municipal laws and regulations to help us in building the city's resilience, this will include updating and establishing acquisition law, planning law, and building law with clear responsibilities.\nAdditionally, in order to improve our waste\nmanagement system, GAM will establish a national training center for environmental issues particularly waste management. The center will provide annual internal training to GAM employees and external training for other organizations and other cities in the region, including the proper use of equipment, and on health and safety issues.\nFinally, GAM will establish a resilience research center to engage communities and community councils in relation to disaster preparedness, public health, climate action, and other services.\n4.3\nMonitoring and evaluation plan\n4.3.1\nA description for managing and monitoring progress\nA set of indicators have been selected from GAM's existing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help us monitor and evaluate our implementation progress in the short and long term.\nGAM currently applies two sets of KPIs; international KPIs and institutional performance KPIs. These are derived from international city KPIs such as the Habitat Agenda KPIs and the Urban Child Development Index (UKID). The GAM specific KPIs are used for monitoring, assessment and evaluation of GAM projects specifically. The KPIs are\ndivided into 7 themes; institutional performance, financial management, infrastructure, city branding, society, urban planning and investment, and environment and health.\nRelevant GAM KPIs have been selected to monitor, review and evaluate Amman resilience strategy to allow us to address emerging issues, improve performance and ensure accountability. In addition, the Resilient Amman team will monitor implementation progress against the strategy pillars, goals and the resilience dividend each action set out to achieve. These are outlined in the summary of goals and actions in section 4.5.\n4.3.2\nCity Resilience Index First User Challenge\nAmman is one of ten City Resilience Index (CRI) First User Challenge cities selected to pilot the CRI Online Tool. The twelve goals of the CRI correlate to the twelve drivers in the City Resilience Framework, and provide a complementary tool to measure and monitor the\nimpact of the resilience actions. By conducting a CRI assessment, Amman will measure its baseline resilience performance on 156 qualitative and quantitative indicators, generating a qualitative and quantitative resilience profile. The qualitative profile will measure how\nAmman's policies, and practices contribute to its resilience, while the quantitative profile will identify the city's current resilience performance. Repeating the CRI assessment at regular intervals will provide Amman with a holistic evaluation of the impact of resilience actions. This process will be led by Amman's CRO Fawzi Masad. The tool will allow the city to undertake a self-assessment to identify the strengths and weaknesses in its resilience performance using the CRI, creating a baseline to plan from and measure future progress. The tool guides users through a set of activities to describe their city, manage data collection and reporting, generate a Resilience Profile and submit a brief narrative report.\nThe process is expected to take between 6-8 weeks for completion. Amongst Amman's\nmotivations in applying for the First User Challenge was the opportunity to measure and assess\nour baseline resilience performance as a crucial first step for implementing and\nunderstanding the impacts of the Resilience Strategy. We also identified the opportunity to continue stakeholder engagement initiated during the strategy development process.\n4.3.3\nSustainable Development Goals\nPioneered by the United Nations (UN) the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include seventeen aspirational goals and 169 targets, covering a broad range of sustainable development issues including ending poverty and hunger, improving health and education, making cities more sustainable, combating climate change, and protecting oceans and forests. SDGs build on their predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and have been adopted by the 194 countries that make-up the UN General Assembly. UN member states will be expected to use SDGs to frame their agendas and political policies over the next 15 years.\nSDGs are directly relevant to enhancing city resilience. As such, in setting out our resilience pillars and actions, we have cross-referenced our goals against the SDGs. The symbols are included in chapter 3 to illustrate which SDGs are met by each action in the Amman resilience strategy.\nThis will allow us to compare with globally recognized framework and help us to monitor progress against the goals we set ourselves.\n4.4\nImplementation in progress\nThe implementation of some of the actions in the strategy is already under way.\nAmman BRT\nYajouz intersection\nThe implementation of the\nBRT system consists of three\nmajor categories, including:\n1. Infrastructure (bus lanes, stations, terminals)\n2.Operations: the operation of the system will be handled by a private operator to be selected through\ncompetitive bidding. The operator will be responsible for providing the buses, developing the depot, hiring and training drivers, as well as handling customer service functions.\n3.Ticketing system: an effective payment system is essential for supporting the operations of the BRT. This is especially true for expediting passenger loading\/ unloading and reducing the bus dwell time at each station.\nThe operation of the system can only\ntake place after the completion of\nthe infrastructure work. Construction\nwork for the bus lanes also includes\nroad work to alleviate current traffic\ncongestion problems at some of the\nkey intersections along the BRT routes.\nThe first stage of Amman BRT\nwas divided into 16 construction\npackages; Package 1 and 2 are already constructed and Package 3 is under construction, the rest of the packages are under work for

I present to you Byblos' Resilience Strategy, a strategy for a contemporary city, drawing on elements of our past and present to guide us toward a vision for a resilient future.\nByblos is a city of tradition as well as modernity; diverse but also peaceful and\nunited. We treasure our past - its customs, traditions, and culture - but that doesn't mean we're fixed in time. As much as we value our heritage, we know that maintaining our unique society requires effort and even change to guide us toward a balanced and resilient future.\nThis strategy charts our journey toward that goal and provides a vision for Byblos in which our natural assets are integrated with urban development, new partnerships are created to foster a thriving multi-sector economy, and traditions are protected and honored. The strategy sets out the actions we'll take to ensure we meet the targets we're setting for ourselves, and provides a robust framework for strategic planning and governance.\nThe strategy acknowledges the social, economic and environmental challenges we face, and recommends practical, achievable solutions to ensure Byblos remains a reflective, inclusive and innovative city in which social cohesion, cultural diversity and local identity meet and merge for the benefit of everyone who lives in and visits the city.\nResilience building is a dynamic process that requires input from everyone in the city, I hope you'll join me on this exciting journey.\nZIAD HAWAT Mayor of Byblos\nIn December 2013, the city of Byblos was selected as one of the very first 100 Resilient Cities (100RC). 100RC is the brainchild of The Rockefeller Foundation and is now evolving into an influential global network of cities, of which we are proud to be a part.\nWe are grateful to the 100RC President Michael Berkowitz, the Vice President for Relationships Bryna Lipper, the Regional Manager Cristiana Fragola, and our Relationship Manager Scott Rosenstein for their inspiration and continuous encouragement on our resilience journey.\nWe are also highly appreciative of the support we have received from Mayor Ziad Hawat, along with the rest of the staff and members of the municipality.\nThe development of the strategy has been a fascinating process, involving research, brainstorming, stakeholder engagement, data collection and analysis, and much more. The final strategy is the culmination of months of hard work and dedication by many highly motivated people, not least my assistant and lead writer Ms. Tania Kallab, as well as engineer and reviewer Eng. Anthony Sfeir.\nSpecial thanks go to the Steering Committee, Mrs Alice Edde, and our local consultants: Ms. Roula Haidar, Ms. Maya Karkour from EcoConsulting, Mr. Adib Dada and his team from theOtherDada, and Prof. Eleish SD from Organization De Developpement Durable (ODDD).\nWe also gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the academic experts who have supported the Byblos municipality: Dr. Rashid Chamoun, Dr. Tony Lahoud,\nDr Joseph Kyprianos, and Dr. Jose Manuel Madrigal from the Lebanese American University (LAU), Dr Elsy Ibrahim and Notre Dame University (NDU).\nSpecial regards also go to our Strategic Partner, the Arup team: Paula Kirk, Dima Zogheib, Laura Frost, and Johnny Ojeil.\nFinally, we'd like to thank Ms. Nathalie Zaarour and her assistant Karine Zoghby from the UNDP, in addition to all of our local stakeholder representatives including NGOs, associations, members of the private sector, and government officials, as well as Ms. Najwa Soueidan, and the special needs organization Ms. Sylvana Lakkis, whose participation in workshops had an extremely positive effect on the strategy.\nTONY ZAKHIA SFEIR\nChief Resilience Officer, Member of Byblos Municipality\n100 Resilient Cities is honored to partner with the City of Byblos to release the\nfirst resilience strategy in the Middle East from the first office of resilience in the\nregion. This marks the beginning of an extraordinary journey for this incredible\nLebanese city as it continues to build its reputation as a global leader in resilience planning.\nFirst and foremost, this would not have happened without the vision and passion of Mayor Ziad Hawat. Tony Sfeir, the Chief Resilience Officer, and his extraordinary support team led by Tania Kallab have gone above and beyond the call of duty\nto produce this visionary document. Arup's technical support was instrumental in guiding this process.\nBuilding urban resilience requires recognizing the interplay of a city's strengths,\nweaknesses, shocks, and stresses. It is also about bolstering the foundation of a\ncity so that it can respond to new, unforeseen events, and help a city function in\ngood times and bad.\nFor Byblos, this resilience building journey involves navigating a complicated\nregional landscape. But at the core of this journey is the city's history and\nidentity, which inspires great affection from both visitors and residents. This has\na significant impact on the economic, social, and environmental fabric of the city. The need for an integrated approach to decision-making is therefore an essential component of the prosperity, stability, and sustainability of Byblos.\nThis strategy, which is the result of many months of research, outreach,\nintrospection, and analysis, looks to identify a road-map for the future. It identifies a range of goals and actions that will address the above-mentioned interplay of challenges and opportunities.\n100 Resilient Cities is committed to working with the city of Byblos in the\ncoming years to implement the vision laid out in this strategy. Through the\n100RC Platform of Partners - a powerful cadre of public, private, non-profit, and academic sector partners - we will bring many resources to this partnership. Unlocking this support and signaling a growing marketplace that is interested in working with cities that incorporate resilience thinking into their planning process is a key tenet of the 100RC philosophy. This partnership and strategy is just the beginning!\nSincerely,\nMICHAEL BERKOWITZ President, 100 Resilient Cities\n<->\nAbout this strategy\nThe strategy comprises the work that the city\nteam has done to date.\nThe strategy sets out the vision for our city,\nthe challenges, the strategic pillars, goals and\nactions to pursue and achieve this vision.\nWe believe that local ownership of the strategy is critical to its long-term adoption and success. To guarantee that outcome, we've made sure\nto include city stakeholders from a variety\nof disciplines and backgrounds including\nthe municipality, private sector, academic\ncommunity and NGOs.\nPhase I of the strategy process aimed to\nproduce a vision for resilient Byblos based on\nassessments of the current state of resilience\nin Byblos and the challenges and opportunities facing the city. Working with our academic partners from LAU, alongside stakeholders from the Advisory Group, and a range of other public and private sector groups. We explored how\ncurrent and future shocks and stresses could\naffect the city and identified which assets are\nalready providing resilience as well as those in\nneed of strengthening. At the end of Phase I, we identified 5 Focus Areas which went on to form the basis of the final Resilience Strategy.\nIn Phase II, we delved more deeply into the\nopportunities identified in Phase I, using the\nResilience Lens tool to prioritize opportunities\nbased on how, and to what extent they\ncontribute to resilience over the short and\nlonger terms. From this we produced a number of actions to be carried forward and practically\nimplemented - these are the main output of the strategy document.\nOBSERVING OUR CHALLENGES\nOil spillage, 2006\nWhile the past conflicts in Lebanon have not directly\naffected the peace of Byblos, our environment and\neconomy have been deeply damaged. In 2006, the Old\nport, rocks and beaches of Byblos were polluted by a\n2 centimeter thick oil slick following the Israeli bombing of storage tanks at the Jiyyeh power station south of Beirut. Short term damages included severe damage to the\nmarine life, disruption to the fishing and tourism industry, and severe stains to the archaeological remains. The longterm damage to the city's natural environment could not be quantified.\nBYBLOS RESILIENCE PROFILE\nByblos is a coastal city vulnerable to numerous\nshocks and stresses - physical, environmental, economic, societal and political - that will affect the city's assets. Over the last few years, the city has been implementing actions to mitigate our known risks. Now, in the face of additional challenges facing our city, country and region, we need to do more.\nOur challenges:\nA fragmented city is not a resilient city\nOur environment is changing\nFor Byblos, preservation of peace is fundamental to our future ability to survive and thrive\nLoss of customs, traditional businesses and know-hows threaten our city's heritage\nOur economy requires diversification\nA fragmented city is not a resilient city\nHistorically, Byblos was a small coastal town, with\n2,000 inhabitants. It was a human scale city, low rise, and compact, with a balance of open space. The city itself consisted of a small fishing harbor that was\nthe regional and commercial hub for the caza. The\nOld City remains at this human scale, but the wider\ncity has expanded to accommodate the growing\npopulation. The city expanded up the hills in an\nuncontrolled and unregulated pattern of development with less community focus, which has led to a reduction in social cohesion and interaction, and a loss of accessibility around the city. Urban sprawl has affected both the physical and social structure of the city. Today, the city is fragmented; a major road cuts the city in half, and part of the infrastructure cannot cope with the network demand of travel. This is due to the reliance on the car as mode of transport. Improving accessibility and linkages around the city is a particular challenge.\nOur environment is changing\nByblos is a city rich in natural heritage, which includes a diverse coastline, river valleys, beaches, orchards, agricultural land, and the surrounding hillside\nwoodlands. These features contribute to the beauty\nof the city and its setting, and offer valuable services. However, they are under threat from urban growth and human intervention. Rapid population growth, rural-urban migration, unplanned urbanization and unregulated construction is causing encroachment of developments into river valleys and the surrounding landscape along with pollution of rivers and aquifers with waste and sewage and occasional droughts\ndue to rising water demands. This is coupled with\nthe absence of appropriate infrastructure such as a\nwaste water treatment plant. Recently the situation\nhas been aggravated by the waste management\ncrisis in the country and in Hbaline landfill site, and\nthe absence of a national integrated and sustainable\nwaste management strategy. Regular power cuts have increased the demand for private generators, which are polluting our air. Protecting the environment is critical for our resilience.\nFor Byblos, preservation of peace is fundamental to our future ability to survive and thrive\nPeace has long been a characteristic of Byblos, and it remains a strong value of the city's citizens. However, with rapid population growth, internal migration and an influx of refugees from Syria, maintenance of social cohesion is a growing challenge. 1.5 million Syrian refugees have recently sheltered in Lebanon; a country whose own population is just 4 million.\nThe region is threatened by armed conflicts resulting from injustice, oppression, lack of freedom, radical ideologies, ruthless dictatorship and religious extremism. Regional instability is accelerating an existing economic crisis and escalating problems of unemployment.\nAccording to UN statistics in December 2014, the latest number of registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon is 1,158,995. In the caza of Byblos, the statistics compiled on the 30th of April 2015 show a total of 1,660 registered refugees in a population of 27,250. The percentage increase since the initial registrations in September 2013 compared to an estimate of a 1% yearly growth rate, is thought to challenge Byblos' population growth rate.\nLoss of customs, traditional businesses and know-hows threaten our city's heritage\nByblos' rich archaeology is nothing less than an open air museum, with sites and artefacts dating back to the early days of the city. Fishing, crafts and other traditional businesses are being replaced by more profitable activities. Cultural customs and traditions are being diluted or forgotten due to lack of education, youth migration, and changing demographics. If this erosion of cultural heritage is not curbed, Byblos will lose the reason why so many visitors are attracted to the city in the first place. For Byblos, preservation of historical assets and culture, and revival of customs and crafts is an important aspect of resilience.\nOur economy requires diversification\nThe ancient city had a variety of economic activities such as fishing and agriculture. Today, the economy relies mainly on tourism, retail and health. Regional unrest, migration of young people (brain drain), shifting economies, growing unemployment and the decline of traditional trades are having an impact on he economic prosperity and resilience of the city, and its attractiveness to investors. Steering economic growth and economic diversity are of particular mportance for our city's resilience.\nOBSERVING OUR CHALLENGES\n\u2018Zina' Storm, 2015\nIn January 2015, a powerful winter storm swept across Lebanon, creating strong winds reaching 100Km\/hour together with high waves and heavy rain. The storm caused an infrastructure collapse. In Byblos, the storm threatened our Old port, archaeological site, and affected some of the businesses. The storm lasted a few days and it was reported as an extraordinary event for Lebanon, unlike any weather conditions experienced for a long time.\nThe timeline illustrates the key milestones along our journey to a more resilient Byblos.\nSelection.\nByblos selected to join the first\n33 cities in the 100 Resilient Cities\nnetwork.\nAgenda Setting Workshop\nrepresented the first significant\nopportunity for 100 Resilience\nCities to engage the Byblos\nmunicipal government and key\nstakeholders following the city's selection. The workshop primary function was to start a dialogue between 100 Resilient Cities\nand key stakeholders on Byblos' resilience context, shocks and stresses and interdependencies. Stakeholders included Byblos Municipal Council leader,\ngovernment ministries, police,\nNGOs, academic institutions, and civic societies.\nStrategy launch and Chief\nResilience Officer appointment.\nThe launch was held at the\nCultural Center in Byblos, bringing together city stakeholders from the municipal government, private sector, academia and civil society. The objective of the launch was to introduce the resilience strategy development process and publicly launch the strategy by the Mayor of Byblos.\nIdentification of Focus Areas\nFive key themes and focus areas\nemerged from the PRA; these\nillustrate the priority areas of focus for the resilient strategy:\n\u2022 Regulate urban development and improve accessibility and linkages of the city\n\u2022 Understand and respect environmental limits\n\u2022 Preserve the peacefulness of the city\n\u2022 Preserve historical assets, and protect and revive customs and traditions\n\u2022 Promote and maintain economic\nResilience Diagnostic and\nAssessment\nTo better understand the physical, social and economic risks facing Byblos, we carried out a Resilience Diagnostic where we have\ndeveloped diagnostic questions\nto further research our Focus\nAreas to identify opportunities\nthat the city can take to improve\nits resilience. The group of all\nthe opportunities is the Field of\nOpportunities.\nField of Opportunity and Resilience Lens\nTo prioritize the Field of Opportunities using the Resilience Lens, to a list of resilience building actions.\nStakeholder engagement\nCity Context developed\nThis includes the following\nactivities: city asset scan, city\nprofile, shocks and stresses review, stakeholder perception review, city action inventory, and gaps and\nopportunities assessment\nPreliminary Resilience\nAssessment (PRA)\nDesigned to establish the city's\nimmediate and long term resilience challenges; evaluate existing capacity for responding to the known and emerging shocks and chronic stresses facing the city; and identify Focus Areas for further investigation during Phase II. 67 stakeholders were engaged in the process.\nPreliminary Resilience Assessment\nByblos | Lebanon\nDevelopment of City ReINsTiElRiEeSTnce Strategy\nTo develop an integrated strategy that underpins the city's vision, goals, and actions.\n100RC Mayors' Pledge\nByblos agreed to commit at\nleast 10% of the annual city\nbudget in support of delivering\nresilience initiatives. This will help\nto fund the actions outlined in\nthis strategy, and support us to\naccess further funding by showing our commitment to building our resilience. In return for this commitment, 100RC will provide the city with up to $5 million worth of goods and services from service providers (Platform Partners) over the next five years.\n1.

A CULTURAL CITY THAT PROTECTS AND HONORS CULTURAL ASSETS, TRADITION, AND LOCAL IDENTITY.\n\u2022 Protect the City's historic assets and coastal heritage\n\u2022 Establish local markets to cherish and protect local identity and traditional\nbusinesses\n5. A THRIVING CITY THAT DIVERSIFIES ITS ECONOMY AND FLOURISHES FROM OUR VALUED CULTURAL AND HUMAN\nRESOURCES\nPromote innovative economic enterprises which create future opportunities that build from\nByblos' existing strengths\nStrengthen the city's role\nin regional economic\ndevelopment\nImprove the socio-economic\nconditions of Byblos residents\n1.\tA CONNECTED CITY: BYBLOS\nWILL BE A CITY THAT PIONEERS\nINNOVATIVE AND INCLUSIVE URBAN SOLUTIONS\nOur understanding of a Resilient Byblos is anchored in multidisciplinary and integrated urban strategies that promote innovative, responsive and sustainable interventions in our city to encourage economic development, ecosystem and resource management, preservation of cultural and natural heritage, and a good quality of life for all.\nOur city is suffering from urban sprawl, uncontrolled construction and a fragmented urban form, which are largely the outcomes of three events:\n\u2022\tThe construction of the highway linking Beirut to Tripoli, which improved access to the city but also contributed to population growth and split the city into two parts, resulting in growth and physical expansion eastwards up the hills, transforming the Old City into a marginal section of the greater Byblos. Another wide road was also built linking the Old City to the upper mountain villages, which further bisected the city from north to south.\n\u2022\tThe 1972 city masterplan - the last masterplan proposed for the city - preserved the Old City at the expense of unrestricted development in other zones, leading to uncontrolled sprawl.\n\u2022\tThe Lebanese civil war, which led to significant migration from war torn areas of the country to peaceful metropolitan Byblos, leading to population growth. The increased demand for housing, intensified the pace of construction, and put additional strain on the city's infrastructure.\nAll have a role to play in what the city suffers today. We need to move toward a more integrated and cohesive urban form. We need improved data about the city and its growth to inform better urban management. And we need to curb the ongoing urban sprawl.\nOur work on urban development is integrated with each of our other goals. Through the way we plan and manage our built environment, we will seek to progress toward better management of our natural environment, more cohesive communities, protected and enhanced cultural heritage, and a more holistic approach to economic growth.\nGOAL A:\nGoal objective: Our city suffers from a lack of data about the people and assets we have, and how we are changing. We are in the digital age, where data is crucial in informing decisionmaking and building more sustainable and resilient cities. We want to improve our city's measurement capability, in order to improve our management.\nONGOING ACTION:\nAction description: The difficulty in finding and\nacquiring data is pushing us to design a brand new data collection and management system, with support from national agencies and our Platform Partner ESRI. As part of working toward a consistent database, we will:\n1.\tDesign our own conceptual data model for Byblos, a geo-database\n2.\tDetermine the GIS system architecture and infrastructure required\n3.\tThrough field surveys and monitoring sites, gather data including demographics, city services, utility infrastructure, zoning, transportation network (e.g. roads, pedestrian and biking trails, street and traffic lights), locations of facilities such as schools, restaurants, historical sites and landmarks, natural assets, etc.\n4.\tConvert existing data for compatibility with GIS\n5.\tDesign and install the identified geo-referenced data systems in municipal offices\n6.\tRecruit and train staff to manage, maintain and analyze the data\n7.\tIn the long term, utilize GIS to guide utility infrastructure planning, urban development and transportation planning, environmental impact assessment, and tracking of development projects.\nWE WILL:\n\u2022 Build our digital infrastructure\n\u2022 Connect our city's neighborhoods and limit urban sprawl \u2022 Design our blue-green network\nIn the longer term, we may find opportunities to\nfurther enhance our digital infrastructure with the use\tGOAL B:\nof satellite imagery and other assets.

Open\ndata stores across different cities around the world\nhave generated multiple benefits for the economy,\ncommunity and to help cities address their challenges through innovative digital solutions. This will help collaboration between citizens and Municipality to plan for a better city and quality of life for all. It will also help the Municipality to direct its resources where they are needed most through a better\nunderstanding of the extent of city challenges, such\nas traffic congestion, parking availability, or water\nleaks. With support from our Platform Partners ESRI\nand Khatib & Alami, we will create an online data\nstore for public access.\nGoal objective: One of the major issues in all the coastal Lebanese cities is the road that was built to connect and facilitate access to the capital\nBeirut. The highway split Byblos into two parts; the Old City (west) and the new city (east).\nThe voie romaine (decumanus) divides the city further into north and south. Four parts of the city converge in a major vehicular roundabout at the geographic center of the city. A fragmented city is not a resilient city. We want to improve connectivity across our neighborhoods, and curb the ongoing trend of unregulated development, which is expanding our city into the hills, leading to traffic congestion, obstruction of major view corridors, and development of the remaining natural landscape.\nMap showing the road (north - south) and the roundabout\n\u00a9 Hashim Sarkis Studios\nMap showing the severance of the city by the road (north to south) and voie romaine (east to west).\nPRIORITY ACTION:\nAction description: We aim to synthesize and assess all the transport studies done to date toward the development of an integrated multimodal mobility plan that not only responds to the spatial challenges that Byblos is facing, but also addresses the problems of the lack of basic fixed infrastructure such as\nsidewalks, safe pedestrian crossing points and signage. This is a particular issue along some of our main roads, including \u2018Voie 13' in the new city, and at the roundabout. There is a need in Byblos to improve transportation on different levels:\n\u2022\tImproving walkability and introducing pedestrian streets, particularly connecting the east and west parts of the city.\n\u2022\tImproving the public transportation system, which is currently limited to small electric buses in the Old City and a main bus route along the highway between Tripoli and Beirut, with no other access around the city apart from by car.\n\u2022\tIntroducing cycling paths to promote active, sustainable travel and recreation, particularly along the coast.\n\u2022\tIntegration of car parking with public transportation.\n\u2022\tPolicy led multi-modal strategy.\nA group of students led by ODDD has started a transport initiative entitled Toward a Sustainable Mediterranean City: Byblos sustainable transportation policies, to understand and address the transport issues Byblos is suffering from.\nWe want to create a safer and more inclusive mobility network for our citizens and reduce urban sprawl by redirecting growth along planned corridors, and will be supported by an integrated zoning plan for the city. We want to set a precedent that other coastal cities in Lebanon can follow.\nAction objective: Improve transport linkages across all parts of the city, promoting safer streets, offering residents and visitors different modes of transport to move around, and creating an exemplar city for other Lebanese coastal cities to learn from.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality\nAction partners: Transport advisors, ODDD (Organization de development durable),private sector sponsors for transport infrastructure.\nTimeline: Medium term\nResilience value:\n\u2022\tImproved connection between communities, key services and places of work\n\u2022\tSafer streets and neighborhoods\n\u2022\tEnvironmental improvements, including air quality and provision of green spaces\n\u2022\tReduction of urban sprawl and redirection of urban growth\n\u2022\tReduction of travel congestion, which can boost economic activity\n\u2022\tImproved health and wellbeing associated with walking and cycling\n\u2022\tImproved social interaction via use of public transport.\nACTION:\nDescription: Pedestrian linkages across the distributary road and roundabout are crucial to improve connectivity between the old and new city, to encourage residents to walk between the two parts of the city instead of going by car, and to reintegrate the Old City into the modern Byblos. Design proposals for linkages include creation of an elevated public space across the road and roundabout, connecting the Voie Romaine with the new municipality headquarters and extending up to the eastern part of the city. Combining this major action with more regular and safe pedestrian crossings, footpaths, cycling routes, will enable the whole city to be navigated by foot and connected east-west, north-south. An integrated pedestrian plan will form part of the overall mobility plan for the city, of which we expect some of these specific interventions to be part.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality\nAction partners: Infrastructure advisors\/planners, private sector sponsors, international funders.\nPRIORITY ACTION:\nProtection of environment and natural assets Increase in green space provision.\nACTION:\nAction description: Byblos will actively facilitate a\ndialogue between the DGU and other stakeholders\nwith an objective to revise building and urban\nplanning laws to contain and limit urban sprawl.\nGoing beyond the existing construction rules and\nregulations, we seek to propose amendments that will improve building performance and limit urban sprawl.\nAction objective: To improve the planning process,\nlaw amendments and implementation to limit urban\nsprawl in Byblos.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality\nAction partners: Order of Engineers and Architects,\nUnion of Municipalities, Directorate General of Urban Planning (DGU)\nTimeline: mid-long term Resilience value:\n\u2022 Strengthened municipal governance and accountability\n\u2022 Strengthened relationships with neighboring municipalities and national government\n\u2022 Improved urban planning\n\u2022 Promotion of compact city development\n\u2022 Engagement with experts toward a public national good\n\u2022 Regulation of urban development and conservation of historic assets\nAction description: Preparing a municipal zoning\nplan to regulate and limit urban sprawl and\nunplanned building developments, and protect the\nsurrounding environment.

The\nsystem relies on gravitational force alone to move the water from one stage to the next. The process starts with waste water passing through a sedimentation tank where all solid particles are removed to leave a homogeneous effluent. This flows through a primary followed by a secondary purification \u2018station' or container filled with the cane roots. The two\npurification stations are linked to improve the treatment\nlevel and regulate flow speeds. Integration also increases the\nsystem capacity by allowing the effluent to move into the\nsecond station once the first is saturated. Fresh water then flows out of the system ready to be reused without harming\n\u00a9 theOtherDada in the environment.\nGOAL C:\nACTION:\nGoal objective: Urban sprawl, unregulated development, drought and other shocks and stresses have caused our open spaces, agricultural land, private gardens, woodlands, rivers and other water courses to be marginalized or removed. We want to bring these natural assets back to create a greener, cleaner and healthier urban environment.\nACTION: 1. BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE NEW CITY TO CONNECT THE CITY USERS TO THE TREATMENT PLANT\nDescription: For the Old City, separate wastewater treatment solutions are to be explored, since it will not be possible to build sub-surface wastewater pipes in this archeologically rich area. Wastewater solutions for this part of the city will take into consideration the sensitivity of the site. We are investigating alternative small scale sewage treatment plants to be installed in restaurants, and the use of natural treatment solutions which uses plant material to filter wastewater to safe standards. The Old City can become a model and a research center for universities showcasing innovative wastewater solutions within a historic center.\nAction owner: Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR)\nDescription: To further resolve our wastewater issues, the solutions for the old and new city will be addressed differently. For the new city, we have a wastewater treatment plant that is already built, but lacks infrastructure connections to the houses and buildings. Planning and building the required infrastructure through a well-maintained sewage network is important for our resilience. We are collaborating with our 100RC Platform Partner ESRI, and Veolia to examine how this can be done.\nAction owner: Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR)\nActio n par tners: Byblos Municipality, Veolia, Union of Municipalities.\nAction partners: Byblos Municipality, Veolia, Union of Municipalities.\nGreen streets in Portland, Oregon\nSHOWCASING EVOLVING PRACTICE\nThe Beirut River LESS strategy aims to bring the Beirut river back to life. The Beirut river extends 30km from its source in the mountains, through peri-urban and urban areas, into the Mediterranean sea. The river in the early 1990s was a natural flowing river with diverse natural river banks and agricultural land, today it flows in a hard engineered channel throughout most of the urban areas, with little or no water flowing. The\nriver suffers from dumping of sewage, wastewater, garbage, industrial waste, and slaughter house waste which then all flow into the Mediterranean sea. The deterioration of the river is having negative impacts on the economy of the surrounding neighborhoods, the communities and the environment. \u2018This is a local problem with a global impact', as the design lead of this initiative puts it. The initiative proposes to address these issues through community engagement, collaborative partnerships, stormwater management and restoration of lost ecosystems.\nACTION:\nOmega Centre for Sustainable Living\nDescription: Developing an urban greening strategy\nsets a framework for protecting and restoring existing green open spaces, limiting urban sprawl, and providing context for the city's future planning. The aim is to adopt a holistic and integrated ecological landscape planning methodology that addresses our city's challenges, and integrate them with our blue network (rivers, stormwater management etc.) to create multifunctional opportunities for economic development, amenity and recreation. The strategy will play a crucial role in connecting our city's neighborhoods through a series of green corridors.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality\nASPIRATIONAL ACTION: 3. REHABILITATE THE\nMAIN STREAM, NAHR JAJ Potential action partners: Lebanon Flora, University Saint-Joseph, theOtherdada.\nDescription: Nahr jaj is one of the streams that cuts across the old and new parts of the city. The stream is currently culverted under the city's roads. We\npropose to open up the river, also known as \u2018stream daylighting', to rehabilitate the natural system, improve drainage and create a green ecological corridor for people and wildlife. The stream will also contribute to improving connections between the two parts of the city, the old and the new. Raising awareness of these forgotten streams is key to retaining a sense of our natural heritage in Byblos.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality of Byblos and Ministry of Energy and Water\nPotentail action partners: Technical advisors, private sector sponsors, LAU, theOtherDada.\n2.\tA RESOURCEFUL CITY: BYBLOS\nWILL BE A RESOURCE EFFICIENT\nCITY THAT OPTIMIZES ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\nOur approach to managing Byblos' natural\nenvironment and ecosystems is one that looks for\nsynergies in approaches to address our priority\nissues. This draws on multidisciplinary contributions to limit anthropogenic pollution, protect natural habitats and encourage sustainable local practices of resource use.\nSome of the environmental challenges that we face,\nsuch as coastal flooding and the sand storm we\nexperienced in 2015, are outside of our direct control so our focus must be to prepare ourselves for such extreme events. Our preparations are outlined under other goals with respect to specific measures to\nprotect our people and cultural heritage. This goal\ntherefore focuses on the environmental stresses that are within our control, which include the difficulties of managing our solid waste, the air quality issues that\nstem from reliance on back-up diesel generators for\nreliable energy supply, and the responsible behaviors of our citizens toward the natural environment.\nOur work to preserve our environment is intrinsically linked to our practices of urban development, and should be considered in tandem with the goals\noutlined in Strategic Pillar 1. Our view is that a unified approach to sustainable behaviors by all of our citizens will generate social cohesion and a sense of wellbeing (Strategic Pillar 4), and new environmental management practices could be a catalyst for economic diversification (Strategic Pillar 5).\nGOAL A:\nGoal objective: To establish sustainable\nwaste management practices and collection\nschemes within the city of Byblos, which\nprotect us from the waste management crises\nexperienced in other parts of Lebanon. To raise environmental awareness amongst Byblos citizens, engage the youth and local community in sustainability-oriented initiatives, and foster a deeper understanding and civic responsibility toward natural resources and our supporting ecosystems.\nPRIORITY ACTION:\nDescription: The first step of this initiative requires\nan assessment of the condition and usability of the\nexisting waste management infrastructure that serves Byblos. This consists of an uncontrolled landfill site in the village of Hbaline, which receives waste from all municipalities in the Caza of Byblos. Identifying opportunities to introduce sanitary controls at the site will be critical to limit environmental damage, particularly as our population grows and an\nincreasing volume of untreated waste is disposed in\nHbaline. As we develop options to improve the site,\nwe also have the opportunity to consider proposals to introduce other infrastructure that will support more sustainable waste management for Byblos and our\nneighboring municipalities. A waste segregation plant will be critical to our ability to reduce the volume of waste we send to landfill and ensure that our reusable and recyclable waste streams can be diverted. With the help of our partner, Veolia, we will be able to\ndetermine best practice strategies for improving\nthe Hbaline site and establishing appropriate waste\ncollection and separation strategies for the city.\nAction objective: To put in place effective\ninfrastructure for sustainable waste management,\nenabling us to reduce the environmental impact\nof our solid waste and generate new economic\nopportunities related to material reuse and recycling.\nWE WILL:\n\u2022 Demonstrate environmental responsibility and promote stewardship by citizens\n\u2022 Invest in efficient and renewable energy\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality\nAction partners: Union of Municipalities,\nenvironmental consultancy firms (i.e. Veolia, Cedar Environmental), other private sector waste collection, recycling, reuse and composting companies and NGOs to be identified.\nTimeline: Short-medium term\nResilience value:\n\u2022\tReduces environmental damages caused by the Hbaline landfill site\n\u2022\tReduces risks to human health due to the landfill\n\u2022\tReduces the future cost of environmental cleanup and regeneration of the Hbaline site\n\u2022\tRaise awareness and active participation in waste reduction and recycling within the community\n\u2022\tEnables Byblos to generate economic value from \u201cwaste\u201d materials through reuse and recycling\n\u2022\tEnables Byblos to reduce the volume of waste sent to landfill\n\u2022\tCreates new economic activity and employment through services related to reuse and recycling\n\u2022\tPositions Byblos as a proactive, responsible and sustainable city, particularly following the 2015 waste crisis in Lebanon\nONGOING ACTION:\nDescription: Following the identification of an appropriate waste recycling plant and collection scheme for Byblos, we will introduce segregated waste bins throughout the city to encourage citizens to separate their waste streams at source. This will be an important way to divert waste from landfills, reduce litter around the city, and raise public awareness of sustainable waste practices.\nTo maximize the benefits, it will be essential to strategically design and locate the bins. We will use international best practices to apply color coding, symbols and shaped openings (e.g. rectangular slit for paper, round opening for glass and plastics) that can be easily recognized and understood. Bins will be concentrated in areas with high pedestrian flow, for example near cafes and restaurants, shopping precincts and festival venues.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality\nCHALLENGE IN CONTEXT\nWaste management crisis in Lebanon\nWaste management in Lebanon is a municipal responsibility, however the municipal budget was given to a private company Sukleen to manage the waste in Lebanon. In July 2015, Beirut's largest landfill site was shut down as it has exceeded its capacity limits. Without alternatives, and without support from the community, the government was paralyzed in finding solutions. Garbage was piling up on the streets of all Lebanese cities, some dumped under bridges, in the river valleys and forests. To make things worse, some municipalities and citizens started burning the garbage causing additional damage to the environment and air quality. The crisis has instigated a number of civil society movements and protests to urgently address sustainable waste management and avoid health impacts.\nAction partners: EcoConsulting, citizens, private se ONGOING ACTION: ,3. STIPULATE WASTE coSEGREGATION FOR ALL RESTAURANT\nONGOING ACTION:\nDescription: Following the identification of an\nappropriate waste recycling plant and collection\nscheme for Byblos, all restaurants in the Old City of\nByblos will be required to sort and recycle their waste, with a long-term plan to expand recycling to other restaurants in Byblos. The first step, which can be implemented immediately, is to reduce organic waste generation by donating excess food to restaurant staff, elderly homes, orphanages and NGOs that care for refugees. Liability being the main impediment to such an initiative, it will be the shared responsibility of giving and receiving parties to ensure that food is fit for consumption. Later, each restaurant will be required to introduce a proper implementation plan to segregate glass, cans, plastics and organic waste for recycling and composting.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality\nPotential Action partners: Environmental\nconsultancies and NGOs such as Lebanese\nFood Bank, FoodBlessed, Cedar Environmental,\nEcoConsulting, private sector waste collection, reuse, recycling and composting companies.\nDescription: We will organize a variety of\nenvironmental education initiatives in the schools\nand universities of Byblos to establish sustainable\nbehaviors in our young people. At school level, all\nstudents will participate in at least one interactive\nenvironmental education class and waste awareness\nsession, such as a play, presentation or discussions\naround environmental themes. Other activities\ncould include hands-on gardening, painting and\nenvironmental graffiti by students in derelict areas\nof the city, which would have an added benefit of\nhelping to uplift the neighborhoods and encourage\ncommunity engagement.\nIn universities, we will look to establish youth\nexchange programs between Byblos university\nstudents and a model European city; by spending\ntime in cities where green behaviors are the norm,\nstudents will become more aware of sustainable\nlifestyles. The promotion of environmental societies in universities will also be encouraged, including inter-and intra-university competitions on environmental themes, such as sustainable design, mobility, etc.\nCompetition winners may be announced in public\nevents in Byblos, showcasing good sustainable ideas to the local community.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality.\nAction partners: Byblos schools, Lebanese American University, private universities, Lebanon Mountain Trail, EcoConsulting, Ministry of Education, NGOs.\nSHOWCASING BEST PRACTICE\nThe Green Glass Recycling Initiative Lebanon (GGRIL) is an\ninitiative led by environmental entrepreneur, Ziad Abichaker, in response to the need for a recycling outlet for green glass bottles in Lebanon following the destruction of the only\ngreen glass manufacturing plant during the July 2006 war.\nWhen the initiative commenced in November 2013, 71 million bottles per year were being dumped in Lebanon's landfills or forests, and the country's traditional glassblowing industry\nwas facing closure. Ziad began collecting green bottles for\nuse in a glassblowing workshop south of Beirut, and started working with the glassblowers to develop new designs and improve access to markets. To date, it is estimated that\nover 180,000 green bottles have been diverted from landfill, helping to revive a declining industry and generate new economic value from waste glass.\nACTION:\nGOAL B:\nDescription: Following establishment of recycling infrastructure and a recycling plan for Byblos, we will encourage the establishment of a green committee in every neighborhood, residential complex or apartment building in the city. The committees will have a responsibility to raise awareness about the need to segregate and recycle waste streams, and will monitor the correct segregation of waste at the building level to ensure that waste streams remain clean enough for recycling. Green committees will be linked with neighborhood committees, as outlined in Goal 3.\nAction owner: Resilient Byblos environmental working group, Byblos Municipality.\nAction partners: EcoConsulting, other private sector waste collection, recycling, reuse and composting companies to be identified.\nGoal objective: To reduce the city's exposure to power outages and reliance on polluting fossil fuels.\nASPIRATIONAL ACTION:\nDescription: Lebanon experiences major electricity supply issues, with hours of power outages each day. The country relies heavily on energy imports to meet domestic demand, the majority of which is sourced from oil. In Byblos, we rely significantly on polluting private generators to ensure the consistency of our energy supply. In a country with 300 days of sun each year, there is significant opportunity to create more local, clean and renewable energy supply networks, not least via photovoltaic and solar thermal technologies. We will explore options to determine the optimal mix of energy sources to meet our demands. We will also ensure the use of incentives - such as tax credits, subsidies, and feed-in tariffs - and loans - like the low-interest NEEREA loans supported by the Central Bank of Lebanon - to promote the adoption of renewable energy generation, and consider interventions to improve energy efficiency and reduce demand, particularly through sustainable building design and operation. In addition, the efficient and renewable energy will contribute to our economic growth and to the creation of job opportunities for our city to thrive.Together, these solutions can help to create a more energy secure future for the city.\nSHOWCASING BEST PRACTICE\nAnti-littering Animation, I am going to start, #AnaRa7Balesh\nThe Anti-littering animation developed by EcoConsulting in partnership with LMTA, and endorsed by the Ministry of Environment, will be shown in all schools as an extracurricular activity. The animation addresses irresponsible behavior toward waste, and the unfortunate consequences it leads to. It is supported by a question and answer sheet for teachers to engage their pupils in a discussion about littering and sustainable waste behaviors.\n3.\tA PEACEFUL CITY: BYBLOS WILL BE A PEACEFUL CITY THAT EMBRACES\nAND PROMOTES SOCIAL COHESION\nAND CULTURAL DIVERSITY\nByblos has a long history as an inclusive, multi-faith society populated by a diverse range of people and communities including native residents, migrant\nworkers, and refugees.\nPeacefulness is a strong value for the city's citizens;\nto date, Byblos has remained largely unaffected by\nunrest in other parts of the country. However, with\nrapid population growth, internal migration and an\ninflux of refugees from Syria, maintenance of social\ncohesion is a growing challenge. 1.5 million Syrian\nrefugees have recently sheltered in Lebanon; a\ncountry whose own population is just 4 million. The\nwider region is also threatened by armed conflicts\nresulting from injustice, oppression, lack of freedom,\nradical ideologies, violent autocratic governments\nand religious extremism. The initiatives identified\nunder this goal are aimed at ensuring ongoing\nchanges in the city do not jeopardize social cohesion or affect the peacefulness and tolerance that have characterized it for so long.\nInclusivity is another key priority for Byblos. We\nare acutely conscious of the vulnerable groups that\nreside within the city, including those who are elderly, physically or mentally challenged, and socially or economically disadvantaged. This goal seeks to ensure these groups have a voice and their needs are adequately addressed. It further promotes the integration of vulnerable groups in all aspects of the city's social, cultural and economic life. These principles are closely aligned with Goal 5, since by embracing the diversity of our people we can turn our unique city characteristics into a catalyst for diverse economic development.\nInclusivity and peacefulness also mean improving\ncommunication and engagement between citizens\nand local authorities, particularly outside of\nelection times.. Actions under this goal are aimed at\nimproving ongoing relations with our citizens and\ncaza communities to minimize the risk of instability,\nespecially during volatile or strained periods. This will lead to improved governance for the city through actively engaged and empowered community.\nGOAL A:\nGoal objective: To engage Byblos' communities to tackle local issues and maintain an excellent quality of life for the people of the city, including vulnerable groups.\nONGOING ACTION:\nDescription: We want to create neighborhood\ncommittees that will:\n\u2022 Work together to change and improve their neighborhoods to achieve better outcomes for the community living and working there\n\u2022 Become the link between the Municipality and the community.\nThe committees will be made up of 4-5 people.\nThe city of Byblos currently comprises more than\n20 neighborhoods which could be regrouped to form 7 larger neighborhood groups. The representation of vulnerable groups will be essential in each\nneighborhood committee.\nAction objective: To include the community and\nvulnerable groups in the decision making and\nimplementation of city actions while boosting\nsocial cohesion and nurturing cross-cutting city\nrelationships.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality.\nACTION: 2. CREATE A YOUTH TASK FORCE TO\nDescription: The youth of Byblos are an asset to\nour city's resilience. They represent the dynamic and creative backbone of the city. The aim is to set up a volunteer Youth Taskforce to connect the future workforce to the city's economic and social activities,\nWE WILL:\n\u2022 Encourage civic engagement and participation in decision making\n\u2022 Manage safety risks, threats and civil unrest\n\u2022 Promote social networks and relationships between the caza communities\nprovide our Youth Taskforce with the required\ntraining, skills, and support to participate in the\ncity's present and future activities and to encourage\nthem to participate in the city's actions, and suggest proposals and initiatives at the city level. Activities can include tourism, hospitality management and others. The youth taskforce will be formed by the high school and university students, and other members of the community.\nAction owner: Mayor's office\nAction partners: Local NGOs, schools, universities,\nlocal cultural associations, tour operators, travel\nagents, local restaurants.\nONGOING ACTION:\nDescription: We want to empower our community\nand engage them in the municipal or public budget allocation. A budget will be allocated to each neighborhood committee to decide on how and where the money shall be spent. This can include local neighborhood level projects, training, education and others.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality\nAction partners: Nahnoo NGO\nINSPIRATION FROM PORTO\nALEGRE\nParticipatory budgeting as catalyst for\ncollaboration\nThe 100RC process provided a platform for networking\nbetween Porto Alegre, Medellin and New Orleans which has helped the cities exchange experiences, collaborate to build resilience, and identify common initiatives and actions that respond to similar challenges. For instance, New Orleans'\n\u2018Icons of Peace' has inspired Porto Alegre to launch a similar initiative. Porto Alegre also recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Medellin to promote and share\npeacebuilding best practices. Along the way, Porto Alegre\nshared its extensive experience with participatory budgeting with these cities and discovered ways to increase effectiveness of this process through improved information sharing.\nGOAL B:\nGOAL C:\nGoal objective: To preserve the peace of our community and mitigate potential risks to our unique historic assets.\nACTION:\nGoal objective: The strong community networks within Byblos have contributed to maintaining the peacefulness that the city has been known for. Our aim is to build on our social networks, strengthen them and expand them to include the rest of the caza communities. Establishing these social networks will become the catalyst for economic, cultural and political collaboration.\nDescription: We want to develop an integrated security strategy to ensure the safety of our community and to protect our cultural heritage. We will collaborate with the national security forces, the local police stations, and the community to have a comprehensive strategy suitable for Byblos and its growing population to address the surrounding security threats.\nAction objective: To ensure Byblos' peacefulness is retained for future generations.\nAction owner: Mayor's office, with the municipal guards section.\nAction partners: Byblos Municipality, national security forces, local police, businesses, and neighborhood committees, specialist advisors.\nPRIORITY ACTION:\nDescription: The Municipality has conducted a survey in 2014 asking the citizens to prioritize projects and services that the city should take forward to address the community's needs. Services for vulnerable groups, elderly people, and children were among the top priorities. Establishing a community center to contribute to our community's development and cohesion is one of our priorities. The center will become the social hub for the city, and will offer appropriate services for the elderly, children and vulnerable groups, host the Youth Taskforce and neighborhood committee meetings, and become the venue for a variety of community and public events. Action objective: To address the citizens' needs, improve the quality of life and contribute to the community's development and level of participation.

Topics covered included an\nintroduction to conflict, the root causes and triggers of violent conflict, causes of the Lebanese civil war, the political economy of civil wars, the UN and conflict resolution in the Middle East, prevention of violent\nconflict, power sharing and constitutional reform in\nLebanon, and bottom up conflict resolution. Similar\ncourses are delivered on a regular basis by the LAU,\nincluding Fundamentals of Conflict Resolution, Crosscultural Communication and Conflict, Community Conflict and Conflict Resolution. The cultural center of Byblos, in coordination with the Youth Taskforce, will coordinate the delivery of similar courses to selected young people, who in turn will deliver training to other community groups in the city.\nAction owner: Byblos Cultural Center, under the\nsupport and direction of the Municipality, can\ncoordinate these activities between LAU, volunteers\nand the community.\nAction partners: LAU, local NGOs, International\nNGOs, UNDP\n4.\tA CULTURAL CITY: BYBLOS WILL PROTECT AND HONOR CULTURAL\nASSETS, TRADITION, AND LOCAL\nIDENTITY\nOur cultural heritage, customs, and traditions are a source of pride for our people, contributing to the distinctiveness of our city. They need to be revived and celebrated. Byblos' history can be traced back to the development of the modern day alphabet, where myths of the death and birth of Adonis, Byblos' main God made the city a famous pilgrimage site in the past.\nCities like Byblos can use protection and celebration of culture as a catalyst for improved economic development, community engagement, participation and social cohesion. This goal therefore contributes significantly to Goals 3 and 5. Some of our oldest traditional sectors have suffered from negligence, shifting economies, regional instability, and youth migration to larger cities. We believe that the traditional economies are an asset to our city that need to be incorporated in our strategy for a resilient Byblos. These include crafts, agriculture, fishing and others.\nFurthermore, this goal is closely related to Goal 1, since without sensitive, responsible and integrated urban development strategies we risk losing our unique built heritage to uncontrolled urban development.\nCharbel Nahas, 2002, study of the development of the Old City of Jbail (Byblos) in the framework of the \"Cultural Heritage Development\" project, with the CDR and the World Bank.\nBYBLOS WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS\nA tsunami simulation for our city\nOur heritage sites are vulnerable to environmental change and shock events. The high waves created by storm \u2018Zina' in January 2015 damaged our Old Port. A tsunami simulation conducted by our 100RC Platform Partner Swiss Re confirms that our Old Port is at risk from coastal flooding. Based on two different tsunami scenarios generated from earthquakes in the region, it is predicted that the largest tsunami could create a 6 meter wave in the port area. This type of event has a return period of around 2,000 years, while a smaller tsunami of 1-3 meters may re-occur every 300-1,000 years. Due to the elevated coastline around Byblos, many of our assets on higher ground would be protected, but the port area would be inundated and some of our old religious buildings too.\nWE WILL:\n\u2022 Protect the City's historic assets and coastal heritage\n\u2022 Establish local markets to cherish and protect local identity and traditional businesses\nGOAL A: PROTECT THE CITY'S ACTION:\nGoal objective: To develop measures, guidelines and frameworks for the protection of the city's historic assets.\nACTION:\nDescription: We will investigate appropriate planning measures, including hard and soft engineering techniques to address the adverse effects of tsunamis, sea level rise, and flooding. The current pier is affecting the sea current and directing the force of the waves onto the ancient port. It has already damaged the marine habitat and created a moderately adverse visual impact. This has resulted in partial collapse of the ancient tower at the entrance to the port. We want to explore the options to construct a wave breaker to absorb the impacts of strong waves, reduce damage to the Old port, and protect fishermen's livelihoods. We would like to align this project with efforts to restore the marine biodiversity. We will work with technical specialists to identify the most effective combination of hard and soft solutions to achieve these outcomes.\nAction objective: To ensure the protection of the\ncoastal historic assets such as the old port and the\nPhoenician port.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality, Ministry of\nEnvironment, Ministry of culture, Ministry of Public\nWorks and Transport.\nDescription: Establish a framework in partnership with the local community, heritage experts in the city and national government institutions, for the restoration of historic buildings in the city, similar\nto the restoration of the souk facades which was completed in 2014. Develop affordable restoration techniques for property owners to implement, and give incentives for training and implementation, such as loans and tax deductions.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality - Engineering\ndepartment\nAction partners: Ministry of Culture, Ministry of\nEnvironment (Directorate General of Antiquities),\nLAU, UNESCO\nBYBLOS PREPARING TO RESPOND\nIn 2014, within the scope of the National Response Plan, UNDP collaborated with Lebanon's National Committee of Disaster Management and the Response Committee of the Caza of Byblos to undertake a field simulation scenario of earthquake and tsunami disaster management in the city of Byblos.\nLocal schools, hospitals, the Civil Defense, and the Army participated in this exercise, which included evacuation of students from a school, receiving patients in the nearest hospital, rescue of injured citizens, warning citizens before a tsunami, ushering citizens to safe areas, securing roads for logistical supports, and preparing a municipal crisis management room. The simulation aimed at testing the response plan and practicing communication and cooperation among the different stakeholders, and at identifying areas of strengths of weaknesses in the city's capability at responding.\nGOAL B:\nACTION:\nGoal objective: To use culture, heritage and\ntraditions in Byblos as a catalyst for economic and social development. To support our community in reviving Byblos' social and economic heritage and dormant traditions.\nPRIORITY ACTION:\nDescription: We want to revive and support\nour traditional crafts through collaboration and\npartnerships with private organizations to empower craftsmen and women, offer required skills training, improve quality of products, and explore innovative designs and improved technology. We want to give incentives to artisans to market and sell the products through valorization and promotion of a high quality brand for Byblos' traditional crafts.\nDescription: We want to organize a monthly farmers' market in the Old City to promote the small-scale farmers, fishermen and traditional industries. The market will become a social space where communities from across the caza meet and interact. We will\nengage with organizations with previous experience, such as Souk El Tayeb, to seek support and potential partnership.\nAction objective: To market the local produce of\nthe city and surrounding villages and promote local\nproducts. To revive traditional foods and recipes to\nprotect and celebrate local identity.\nAction owner: Community-based organizations, with the Office of Community Development, supported by Byblos Municipality\nAction partners: Byblos Municipality, Souk El Tayeb,\nfarmers, and fishermen cooperatives\nTimeline: Medium term\nResilience value:\n\u2022 Preservation of traditional economic activities\n\u2022 Reinforcement of social cohesion and relationships\n\u2022 Valorization of the local products\n\u2022 Revival of local industries and economies\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality, Union of\nMunicipalities\nAction partners: Private sector sponsors, schools, universities, local NGOs and social enterprises.\nBYBLOS WORKING COLLABORATIVELY\nDuring the 100RC strategy development process, the city has collaborated with the Lebanese American University (LAU) under the supervision of Professor Jose Madrigal, to begin surveying and creating an inventory of the historical assets in the city. We need to continue our efforts in surveying and documenting all our historical assets including assets requiring restoration and preservation. The inventory should include the type, condition, age, and ownership of our historic assets, which will enable us to\nmonitor and protect our heritage resources. The inventory should be accompanied with survey and mapping information compatible with GIS.\nAs we take this work forwards, the municipal\nEngineering department will become the owner of the inventory. They will collaborate with our Platform Partner ESRI, with continued input\nfrom LAU together with the Lebanese Ministries of Culture and Environment, and UNESCO.\nINSPIRATION FROM NORFOLK\nNorfolk, Virginia\nThis US coastal city with a bustling port is embarking on a resilience building journey with notable similarities to Byblos. Released in October 2015, their resilience strategy helps the city address its challenges in an integrated manner. Like Byblos, it is grappling with growing coastal threats, which threaten to undermine both prosperity and community cohesion. Addressing these threats will require better understanding and dissemination of the city's data, connecting and empowering marginalized communities, and the identification and implementation of innovative water management solutions. Examples of these approaches include:\n\u2022\tLaunching a state of the art resilience dashboard to integrate and synthesize data;\n\u2022\tPartnerships with the Netherlands to design robust water management initiatives;\n\u2022\tEmpowering neighborhood faith-based communities to support emergency preparedness efforts across the city.\nSHOWCASING BEST PRACTICE\nL'Artisan du Liban is a social enterprise founded in Beirut in 1979, an initiative of the Lebanese Social Movement with support from private donors. Its mission is to preserve Lebanese crafts and artisanal creative products, and allow artisans to maintain a viable livelihood through their work. The key drivers for the initiative are to promote the creativity of young artisans, coordinate the marketing of products through outlets in Lebanon and promote distribution abroad, contribute to job creation in rural and urban areas, empower workers, and distribute revenues to promote crafts and finance social projects. L'Artisan du Liban currently has three stores Beirut and Tripoli. Currently, more than 800 artisans, throughout Lebanon contribute to the creation of artisanal work. In 2014, a new workshop opened in Tekrit-Akkar, a remote rural area, creating an opportunity for both Syrian refugees and local people to acquire skills in traditional Syrian Aghabeneh embroidery, sewing and block printing, thereby contributing to social inclusion, identity and creating economic opportunities for Syrian women.\n5. A THRIVING CITY: BYBLOS WILL\nBE A CITY THAT DIVERSIFIES ITS\nECONOMY FLOURISHES FROM OUR\nVALUED CULTURAL AND HUMAN\nRESOURCES\nByblos is characterized by a vibrant and diverse economy, which places the city in a strong economic position compared with other Lebanese cities. Historically, the main economic activities of the city centerd around trade and agriculture. Today, with the help of migration and tourism, the city hosts 12 main industries, spanning health, education, finance, hospitality, tourism, commerce, law, and construction, among others. There are around 3,000 businesses in Byblos serving a growing number of city residents and visitors.\nOur dependence on agriculture has declined substantially as other activities have grown and real estate development has expanded on to our former farm lands. Around 150,000m2 of agricultural land remains in Byblos, consisting primarily of greenhouses.\nByblos continues to hold a strong appeal with tourists, especially Lebanese and other Arab visitors; the city has been named Arabic Capital of Tourism 2016 by The Arab Tourism Organization. However, continued instability in the region has led to a decline in the number of foreign tourists. Overreliance on tourism revenue is therefore a significant resilience challenge.\nPromoting and maintaining the diversity of Byblos'\neconomy is a critical requirement to ensure resilience, especially by expanding the city's role as a hub for banking, retail, education and artistic and cultural activities, as well as an advanced medical center\nfor the region north of Beirut and north Lebanon.\nBy creating economic opportunities and enabling\nsustainable livelihoods, the city can support its\npopulation into the future and generate the financial resources needed to secure its survival.\nDiversification is an integral outcome from each of our other resilience goals; by transforming our approach to urban development, environmental management, social cohesion and cultural heritage, we intend to\ngenerate new economic opportunities that build upon our historic assets to create a forward-looking future city.\nWE WILL:\n\u2022 Promote innovative economic enterprises which create future opportunities that build from Byblos' existing strengths\n\u2022 Strengthen the city's role in regional economic development\n\u2022 Improve the socio-economic conditions of Byblos residents\nGOAL A: PROMOTE INNOVATIVE ONGOING ACTION:\nGoal objective: To promote diversification into sectors that will enable Byblos to be more active in the 21st century global economy, particularly sectors that attract young people.\nASPIRATIONAL ACTION:\nDescription: Byblos has a long legacy of economic activity and skills related to traditional crafts, agriculture\/horticulture and fishing, not to mention a unique built heritage that offers a special setting for media, film production, and digital. We would like to promote growth clusters that encourage these creative industries to develop and thrive in Byblos, making use of existing networks and partnerships.\nBy developing growth clusters, we will incentivize SMEs to locate in Byblos by offering them space and communication\/logistical facilities. We will build a local knowledge base to promote research and innovation around our targeted industries.\nThis will draw young creative entrepreneurs from local universities to settle in Byblos. We will create incubators for new creative products and activities.\nIn the long term, the market for these sectors will grow as Byblos becomes recognized as a hub for the creative economy, a reputation that will further enhance our attractiveness to tourists and other visitors.\nThrough our growth clusters we do not intend to constrain ourselves only to creative industries. Our encouragement of clusters will also target healthcare, which is already strong in Byblos but which will need to continue developing as we respond to a growing population and seek to retain our position as a healthy city in Lebanon.\nDescription: Byblos is renowned for its annual International Festival, which attracts performers and artists from all over Lebanon and the world for a month-long festival of arts and music. In summer 2015, Byblos also launched a new festival to celebrate local wines, drawing on its history of exporting Lebanese wines to the Roman Empire. This ongoing festival program is important to promoting Byblos as a destination and attracting visitors who spend money in local shops, restaurants and hotels. The festivals will continue to play a central part in Byblos' economy, and opportunities to expand and diversify the program of events will be considered on an ongoing basis to attract a wider audience, especially during the tourist low season. We will particularly focus on supporting lesser-known, younger artists to help build their profile, and we will develop a stronger communications plan to support our events. In 2016, an exhibition may be held to celebrate Byblos' year as Arabic Capital of Tourism. We would also like to enhance the content of our existing festivals by introducing themes about environmental responsibility and green practices -for example, raising awareness through the use of recycling stations, recyclable packaging, e-ticketing, etc. - which will help to achieve our goal of resource efficiency.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality.\nAction partners: Ministry of Tourism, Union of Municipalities, event managers.\nGOAL B:\nGoal objective: To grow our local economy as\nan integral part of economic development in the wider region, leading to improved capacity to thrive sustainably as a union of municipalities and not only as one small city.\nPRIORITY ACTION:\nDescription: Byblos' economic influence is not\nconstrained to the municipal borders. The larger\ndistrict (qadaa) of Jbeil comprises 92 towns and\nvillages and around 83,000 inhabitants over an\narea of 430 square kilometers. While Byblos is the\ncapital of the district and hosts a range of important archaeological and coastal visitor attractions, the wider district also has a wealth of facilities and\nattractions to offer. One of the challenging things\nabout tourism in Byblos is the short average duration of each tourist visit. By leveraging the assets of the wider region, Byblos has the opportunity to create a program of tourist activities that would attract longer stays and a more diverse range of tourist experiences, thereby enhancing Byblos' reputation as a tourist\ncenter. This would reap benefits both for Byblos\nitself, and for the surrounding towns and villages. For example, organized trips could be offered to tourists staying in Byblos' luxury hotels, to visit beautifully\npreserved local villages in the mountains, to hike, take environmental excursions, sample cuisine cooked from ingredients grown on local farms, participate in cooking and craft schools, and visit local wineries. In collaboration with local hotels and businesses in the wider region, we will identify opportunities to expand Byblos' tourist program and attract new types of ecotourism, cultural tourism, artistic and gastronomic tourism. This diversification will attract people\nfrom a wider variety of ages and backgrounds and\nhelp to strengthen and sustain our tourism sector.\nOpportunities could be promoted to tourists via\nhotels and a strengthened tourist office in Byblos.\nAction objective: To diversify the range of tourist\nattractions available to Byblos' visitors, promoting\nlonger stays and deeper engagement with the culture and environment of the region.\nAction partners: Ministry of Tourism, travel agencies and tour operators, regional businesses including hotels, museums, wineries, restaurants, etc.\nTimeline: Medium term.\nResilience value:\n\u2022 Strengthened and more sustainable tourist sector for Byblos.\n\u2022 Creation of new jobs in the tourist sector, supporting the growing city population.\n\u2022 Generation of additional revenues through expansion of tourist sector.\n\u2022 Enhanced image and reputation for the city and district.\n\u2022 Improved flow of tourist revenues to towns and villages in the wider area.\n\u2022 Improved coordination of economic planning and governance between the city and wider region.\n\u2022 Incentives to preserve heritage and traditional practices in the wider region as a mechanism to attract tourists.\nACTION:\nDescription: We will schedule regular meetings\nwith other municipalities, business and economic\nstakeholders to explore and identify potential\ndevelopment projects or targeted investments that\ncould benefit multiple cities and villages, including\nByblos, by building on our common resources.\nPartnerships with other municipalities and business\nbeyond Byblos' city limits will be an important way\nto create new economic opportunities within Byblos itself. By drawing on the combined resources of the Union of Municipalities we can each achieve more value with less individual cost. Examples of collaborative initiatives might be a shared program of cultural events and festivals at a specific time in the year, a shared tourist guide to promote visitor attractions throughout the region, networking and training events for entrepreneurs and SMEs throughout the region to help consolidate our growth clusters, or physical developments such as a training center for use by all municipalities in the Union. Action owner: Byblos Municipality.\nAction partners: Union of Municipalities, regional\nbusiness stakeholders.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality.\nACTION:\nGOAL C:\nDescription: Byblos is home to the Lebanese American University (LAU) campus outside Beirut. This is an incredible asset for Byblos compared with other cities in the country. Furthermore, as a world heritage center designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Byblos is an international focus for research and education related to the city's ancient history. These assets are the foundation for Byblos to grow its knowledge economy to become a regional hub for learning and education, especially in relation to history, archaeology and urbanism. Through the development of this strategy we have already worked closely with architects in the urban planning unit at LAU, as well as leveraging projects that are being run by other stakeholders via the university (such as the bus stop design competition for the Municipality). We will look for opportunities to continue consolidating links between the Municipality and our university, and to identify research and educational projects within the city that could attract other researchers and educators from inside and outside Lebanon. By doing so we hope to further diversify Byblos' economy and raise the city's status internationally as a center for research and knowledge.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality.\nAction partners: Lebanese American University, UNESCO, other educational partners\nGoal objective: To improve the quality of life for Byblos residents, particularly those working in traditional industries, by promoting viable and sustainable livelihoods\nPRIORITY ACTION:\nDescription: Fishing is a long-standing part of Byblos' economy and society. However over recent years, fishing has become a less lucrative profession, the number of fishermen has decreased and the special traditions of local fishing have been declining. We would like to reinvigorate our traditional fishing industry by offering support to fishermen via the fishermen syndicate union. We will explore opportunities to offer training on sustainable fishing and basic business skills to enable fishermen to manage their activities effectively. We will also explore options to diversify the fishing industry by introducing a fishing school and day trips for visitors to learn the traditional fishing techniques. This could be linked with local cooking schools to enable visitors to learn both how to catch and prepare their fish according to local customs. These opportunities will be promoted via local hotels and the tourist center. We hope this would bring an alternative source of income for fishermen, helping to create a more viable livelihood. Furthermore, we will explore options to re-open the fish market in Byblos to provide better opportunities for fishermen to sell their products.\nSHOWCASING BEST PRACTICE\nBeit Douma is a guest house located in the village of Douma in the Batroun Mountains near Byblos. The guest house is a carefully restored 19th-century Lebanese mountain home, and the village of Douma is recognized as one of the best-preserved villages in Lebanon. Surrounded by olive groves and orchards, Beit Douma positions itself a retreat for visitors seeking to get away from the stress of everyday life, enjoying traditional foods with produce from the kitchen garden.\nBeit Douma is one of three such guest houses developed by the Souk El Tayeb organization. Byblos has the opportunity to create its own role within an agenda of sustainable economic development in the surrounding region.\nAction objective: Improve the fishermen's livelihoods through sustainable fishing practices.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality.\nAction partners: Fishermen syndicate and\ncooperative.\nTimeline: Medium term.\nResilience value:\n\u2022\tSupporting vulnerable communities and improve livelihoods\n\u2022\tReviving traditional businesses\n\u2022\tSeek employment opportunities in the city\nACTION:\nDescription: East of the highway, the modern city of Byblos is an increasingly dense urban environment, however there remain several pockets of agricultural\nand horticultural land that have withstood modern urban growth. On this land, farmers continue to cultivate bananas, pomegranates, olives and other fruits. This local produce is part of the region's history, and we would like to prolong our connection to the land despite the ongoing threat of development. We will seek to help farmers diversify their businesses and improve productivity, for example with the use of improved farming practices and technologies, and developing brands based on local and sustainable\/ organic produce. We will explore options to incentivize farmers to continue cultivating their land, for example by finding opportunities to sell produce locally at farmers' markets and local stores in the city. Our work with farmers will connect to our wider strategy to protect Byblos' natural and cultural heritage, and promote new forms of tourism centered around the region's traditional practices.\nAction owner: Byblos Municipality, Ministry of Agriculture, Farmers in Byblos.\nActions partners: Farmers in Byblos, Agricultural experts\nSHOWCASING\nEVOLVING PRACTICE\nThe municipality of Jounieh, just south of Byblos, received around $250,000 from the United States' Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Building Alliance for Local Advancement, Development and Investment (BALADI), to improve the cooperative facilities for fishermen at Jounieh port. It aims to reactivate the harbor of Jounieh as part of the broader development strategy for the city. Upgrades to the port include rehabilitation of the fishermen's boat repair workshop, renovation of the fishermen's cooking station, as well as the fish auction site. The upgrades benefit around 40 fishermen and their families by improving working conditions and reducing the financial burden of managing fishing activities, leading to more viable livelihoods.\nLEARNING FROM OUR PAST\nDuring a visit to Byblos, one cannot help but notice the\ngranite columns inserted in the walls of the Old city, the\ncitadel and the crusaders' castle. The granite columns\nwere quarried in Egypt and brought to Byblos by the\nRomans to use in the construction of the city to reinforce and fortify the walls, particularly against the threat of earthquake. Our city's existence to this day is evidence that the ancient civilizations who inhabited the city were thinking of innovative solutions to shocks early on.\nBYBLOS IN CONTEXT\nByblos is known to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; a Phoenician city, inhabited since Neolithic times with evidence of human settlements dating back more than 7,000 years. As such, the city is already a testament to resilience. We want to embrace our challenges, and build resilience to maintain the city's existence for the next 7,000 years.\nAncient Byblos was a major port, trade hub and center of learning; the founding\nof the modern alphabet by the Phoenicians earned the city its name - Byblos -which comes from the Greek for papyrus.\nModern Byblos - or Jbeil - retains a strong sense of its heritage; home to the internationally distinguished Lebanese American University (LAU) and renowned for its diversity of cultural and religious traditions. The city has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1984.\nDespite a long and destructive civil war in Lebanon (1975-1991), the city of Byblos has remained largely unaffected by unrest in other parts of the country. Then as now, the city is proud of its long tradition of multi-faith tolerance and ethnic coexistence. In the wake of current conflicts in nearby Syria and Iraq, efforts are now underway to ensure that the pressures placed upon the city's services by an influx of refugees and migrants do not negatively affect the peacefulness and tolerance that have characterized the city for so long, but become an opportunity for the city in the future. Challenging events such as these should not damage the city's image as open, tolerant and diverse. Among others, these factors provide a contextual underpinning to the development of the resilience strategy.\nBYBLOS HAS A LONG HISTORY AS A DIVERSE, MULTI-FAITH SOCIETY. THE DOMINANT RELIGIONS ARE\nCHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM.\nBYBLOS HAS A RESIDENT POPULATION OF 27,500, 65,000 WITHIN ITS CITY LIMITS, 100,000 WITHIN THE METROPOLITAN AREA, AND A GROWTH RATE OF\n0.9%.\nDELIVERY AND MONITORING\nDELIVERING THE STRATEGY\nWe recognize that this strategy is ambitious. But we\nbelieve we can unlock the necessary resources to\nmake these actions a reality. This will be achieved\nthrough local, national, and international partnerships. And this strategy will serve as the foundation for attracting these partners while providing a coherent and thoughtful road map for exploration and\ninnovation.\nIn the coming months we will create a detailed action plan, assign roles and responsibilities and appropriate timelines for the execution of these tasks. Successful implementation will require strong coordination and communication with a diverse array of individuals.\nOur People\nPeople are our most important asset and we want to ensure all of our skills and knowledge are put to the most effective use in implementing the strategy.\nOur Platform Partners\nThe Platform is a curated suite of resilience-building\ntools and services, provided by partners from the\nprivate, public, academic, and non-profit sectors,\ngiving our cities access to the resources they need to become more resilient.\nOur Stakeholders\nThe CRO's office will be responsible for initiating\nthe plan, in collaboration with the Working Groups\nand other local stakeholders including NGOs\nand academic partners. The strategy provides a\nframework for the delivery of the resilience goals and actions we've identified but collaboration is essential to make sure everyone is supported and able to carry out the actions we've set ourselves.\nOur Municipal Staff\nOver the coming months, we'll be working with\nmunicipal staff to ensure they have the tools they need to deliver the strategy, and the support to engage with a variety of other city actors.\nOur Regional & National Government\nBeyond the limits of the city, we believe the strategy also provides a meaningful platform to engage regional authorities and partners including the union of municipalities, and the national government. As a pioneer in resilience, we hope to use what we've learned over recent months to facilitate a wider dialog on the importance and potential impact of resilience planning in the region and the country. Through this process we also aim to engage new collaborators and establish working partnerships for the mutual benefit of all involved.\nMONITORING PROGRESS\nDialog and transparency are important to the delivery of the resilience plan. To ensure we're progressing toward our targets and building on our actions, we are setting out a monitoring plan.\nCity Perceptions Tool\nHaving developed an action plan to enhance\nresilience, it is also important that we keep track\nof how activities are progressing so we can make\nadjustments, assess impacts and explore further\nopportunities.\nDuring the PRA process, we carried out a Stakeholder Perception analysis using a structured perception tool. This helped us to understand how city stakeholders\nview the current level of resilience in Byblos, as well\nas the major risks facing the city and opportunities\nto tackle them using our existing assets. As part of\nthe ongoing monitoring process, we will run this\ntool again to gauge how views have changed since\nit was implemented, and how drivers have evolved\nsince the start of the resilient strategy development.\nThis will allow us to assess progress, and identify any remaining gaps and future risks that the strategy may then be adapted to cover.\nMonitoring will allow the CRO and other stakeholders working on resilience to review the status of actions and facilitate feedback between parties, for example relating to challenges that prevent progress. The\nmonitoring schedule will also provide a framework\nthrough which we will keep the Mayor up-to-date\non the development of the action plan. The Working\nGroups and other partners including LAU will also\nfeed into this process.","ENTITIES":{"DATE":["July 2015","1972","October 2015","1984","1979","November 2013","December

MIGUEL A. MANCERA ESPINOSA\nMayor of Mexico City\nA Resiliency Strategy submitted by Mexico City was prepared under the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, of which our city has been a member since 2013. This Resilience Strategy is a response to a global commitment by CDMX to foster public policies that contribute to strengthening Mexico City\u2019s capacity to address various risks without without compromising our development.\nAs one of the greatest megacities in the world, Mexico City is an excellent center for the innovative proposals needed to improve its inhabitants' quality of life. Building resilience must be tackled on multiple fronts. For example, the Water Fund for Mexico City aims to strengthen the water supply system and increase environmental protection of water conservation areas. Other projects are also contributing to the creation of resilience. For example, the Comprehensive Mobility Program is giving pedestrians and bicycle riders priority over private cars. A bus replacement project is removing old, obsolete, unsafe buses from our roads and fostering investment in up-to-date and safe transportation technologies, including electric cabs, which will help reduce pollutant emissions. And the Vision Zero initiative is reducing the number of road accidents.\nBuilding resilience is in everyone\u2019s interest. It is a short- and long-term endeavor that requires the participation and coordination of various stakeholders at the local and regional levels and from both the public and private sectors\u2014from the outset and all through the implementation of the proposed actions. Public involvement is critical to building a community capable of facing the risks that all are exposed to, a community that can play an active role in responding to emergencies. Building resilience at all levels can help reduce social inequality and vulnerability, and produce a safer, fairer, and more equitable society.\nTANYA MULLER GARCIA\nSecretary of the Environment\nMexico City faces great challenges, some of which are connected with climate change, such as a decrease in the quantity and quality of environmental services available and an increase in extreme weather events. An example is the scarcity of water, which has become one of the most serious issues faced by a population already affected by the impacts of drought and the loss of green areas, which are causing a lower aquifer recharge zone in Conservation Areas.\nEnvironmental policy has planning instruments such as ecological realignment of areas, which regulate development activities in order to preserve natural resources, improve people's quality of life, and guarantee the water supply in the city. Nonetheless, the complexity of the challenges Mexico City faces requires the city to find new approaches to these challenges and to develop innovative solutions that result in multiple benefits and that support the CDMX sustainability agenda.\nWe have therefore developed a comprehensive public policy designed to counter the effects of climate change, as stated in the Mexico City Climate Action Program 2014-2010 (PACCM). This policy brings various stakeholders together and fosters the coordination of actions to reduce social, environmental, and economic risks. Resilience building is a specific strategic focus of the PACCM that aims to develop and improve the adaptive capacity of Mexico City.\nResilience is a concept that spans all environmental issues. It involves multiple sectors of society and requires the integration of specific actions that are needed for urban renewal and a revitalized infrastructure. Resilience building can strengthen civil society and ensure that citizens at all levels of society have the ability to act in an emergency or disaster situation.\nMexico City's Resilience Strategy represents an opportunity to join together to support the economic and social development of the city, in harmony with the environment and with a vision for the future and our long-term commitments.\nMICHAEL BERKOWITZ\nPresident of 100 Resilient Cities, Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation.\nTOO Resilient Cities is honored to partner with Mexico City to support this important work and the release of this Resilience Strategy, which responds to the city's most pressing shocks and stresses, such as flooding, limited mobility, and social inequity, and the need for better integrated regional planning.\nThe support and leadership of Mayor Mancera was crucial to the development of this strategy, and we are thrilled that the team is now taking steps to institutionalize the Resilience Office and implement the outlined initiatives. I would like to thank Tanya Muller Garcia, the Secretary of the Environment, without whose leadership and support this would not have been possible. In addition, I would like to highlight the work of the city\u2019s Chief Resilience Officer, Arnoldo Matus Kramer, and his team, which includes Daniela Torres, Adriana Chavez, and Flavia Tudela, who laid the groundwork for this forward-thinking Resilience Strategy and hosted the 2015 Chief Resilience Officer Global Summit, which offered the opportunity for high-level stakeholders to engage in resilience thinking.\nThe CDMX Resilience Strategy identifies five pillars and interrelated goals that are to guide the city-driven initiatives that will make the city stronger and more resilient. Featured in the strategy are initiatives that range from promoting better regional coordination to rethinking water management and flood protection.\nFinally, we should remind ourselves that the release of this strategy only represents the beginning of a long road for Mexico City. The strategy outlines a set of opportunities that must now be delivered on.\nWe are thrilled to be continuing our work in Mexico City and to be supporting the work of the three other Mexican cities in our network. We look forward to seeing the implementation of this strategy's initiatives with the support of an important and diverse set of actors from city agencies, local organizations, and the 100RC Platform of Partners, who have all rallied together to help create this strategy.\nViva Mexico City!\nARNOLDO MATUS KRAMER\nCDMX Chief Resilience Officer\nGiven its geographic location and social and economic context, Mexico City has faced many challenges and environmental impacts throughout its history. Today the citizens of Mexico City face such dynamically changing risks that we must create an environment of continuous learning and innovation to face present and future threats.\nOur city is a living laboratory for new initiatives and technologies to build resilience from local to regional levels. At the local level, community development is vital to getting the public involved in building resilience and to increasing the public\u2019s ability to face and respond to risks. At an urban level, successful, high-impact experiences must be shared and replicated in various areas, including at a regional level.\nThe Resilience Strategy is a living document, integrating best practices relating to key issues such as achieving aquifer sustainability or transforming the mobility system into city and regional planning. Issues such as these require the collaborative efforts of a coalition of stakeholders as well as the sustained, long-term support of human, technical, and financial resources. Therefore, the future creation of a Resilience Office for CDMX is an opportunity to strengthen this integration process and to track the projects and actions resulting from the Resilience Strategy.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe vision of Mexico City (CDMX) is to create an equitable society based on an all-embracing process in which various stakeholders, sectors, and vulnerable groups to survive the major challenges of the 21st century.\nThe city faces resilience challenges on environmental, social, and economic issues, given its geographic situation, history of great social-environmental transformation, and social context. Having once been a lake, the city has become a megacity, one of the most populous on Earth. Rapid urban expansion and soaring population growth in the last few decades have added to the problems resulting from insufficient longterm planning and weak metropolitan coordination, making it difficult to monitor and track important regional issues such as water management based on a long-term sustainability perspective.\nCDMX is faced with multiple risks, both natural and man-made. Although some of the most frequent impacts have been of hydrometeorological origin, geological phenomena, such as the 1985 earthquake, have caused the greatest economic and human losses. On a basis, there are other stresses that weaken the city, such as the inequality that exists at both a social and economic level as well as in the use of public space. For example, across the city, there is inequality of access to urban amenities and public services. Aquifer overexploitation is not just one of the most pressing and chronic issues affecting the future water supply for this region's population, it is also a determining factor for seismic exposure, which can result in differential subsidence. Climate change may exacerbate risks and potentially increase the intensity of hydrometeorological events, causing historically unprecedented heat waves, extreme rainfall events, and long droughts.\nIn 2013, Mexico City was selected to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative by The Rockefeller Foundation. This initiative is an opportunity for cities to bring together their urban resilience building efforts and capabilities. The CDMX Resilience Strategy is being developed as part of this initiative, and to address the challenges facing the city through five pillars, or guiding principles. These pillars will drive the implementation of actions to improve the adaptive capacity, disaster response, and infrastructure development of CDMX.\nPILLAR\n01\nFOSTER REGIONAL COORDINATION\nGiven the urban growth experienced by CDMX, resilience building must transcend political and administrative boundaries. Maintaining a regional view and coordination at all levels are key to building resilience, especially on priorities such as water and integrated mobility management. In the vision of this pillar, Megalopolis and the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico (ZMVM) work together under a regional institutional framework on key issues to drive a common agenda and ensure shared responsibility in building resilience. Infrastructure projects with a regional impact, such as the New International Airport of Mexico City (NAICM) currently under development, are an opportunity to work more closely on resilience efforts and move toward a collaborative regional agenda.\n\nPILLAR\n02\nPROMOTE WATER RESILIENCE AS A NEW PARADIGM TO MANAGE WATER IN THE MEXICO BASIN\nA major resilience issue is linked to the future supply and management of water resources. The water management system has material inefficiencies; for example, there is a great loss of potable water due to leaks in the potable water distribution system. There is also great overexploitation of the aquifer. This overexploitation threatens the future supply of aquifer water for the metropolitan area, and it may be exacerbated by climate change, as there is a potential for a long drought. In the case of extreme rainfall events, ponding and floods may affect City operations, such as the mobility network. The vision for this pillar is that water in the Mexico Basin is handled under the Comprehensive Management of City Water Resources (GIRHU), which is responsible for the integrated management of urban water resources and the response to risks and impacts related to climate change and social and environmental pressures. The GIRHU must ensure equal access to the water supply and guarantee the water supply for the entire population.\nPILLAR\n03.\nPLAN FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL RESILIENCE\nUrban and regional planning play a fundamental role in building resilience. The vision for this pillar is that CDMX citizens have equal access to urban amenities, housing, green areas, and public spaces, and that improvements in the environment and mitigation of risks occur through a sustainable management of natural resources. Planning is a fundamental tool for maintaining a long-term vision and for addressing current challenges on issues such as inequality, and for increasing resilience in the face of new challenges created by dynamic processes, such as climate change.\nPILLAR\n04.\n(fa)\nIMPROVE MOBILITY THROUGH AN INTEGRATED, SAFE, AND SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM\nMobility is one of the most pressing issues that must be addressed in order to improve quality of life in Mexico City. Today, the mobility system involves long commute times, loss of competitiveness, and impacts on health and social cohesion. Investment in public transportation is required in order to improve the quality and safety of the mobility system, as well as to create an integrated system that serves the entire population of the city. The vision of Pillar 04 is an integrated mobility system for CDMX and the ZMVM that gives priority to public transportation over private vehicles and provides a safe urban environment for pedestrians and bicyclists. In this vision, innovative transportation projects, technologies, and the smart use of data validate the benefits of improving mobility via an integrated, safe, and sustainable mobility system while discouraging the use of cars.\nPILLAR\n05.\nDEVELOP INNOVATION AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY\nThis pillar has the goal of increasing the capacity of CDMX to respond to dynamic, changing risks of a natural or social origin without compromising economic competitiveness and sustainable development. To build resilience, innovative processes and tools must be developed that enable government and various social and economic sectors to be aware of and understand their vulnerabilities and reduce the risks they face, particularly with respect to climate change.\nFinally, for a successful implementation of the Resilience Strategy, a Resilience Office for CDMX must be established, as cities such as Barcelona, New York City, and New Orleans, among others, have done. The Resilience Office must be all-embracing and flexible enough to coordinate the efforts of government stakeholders at various levels (city, region, and country), as well as stakeholders in civil society, the private sector, and the scientific community. The Resilience Office must also take charge of co-designing a tracking system that facilitates continuous learning and innovation to build resilience in CDMX.\nI\nINTRODUCTION\nResilience refers to the capacity of the individuals, communities, enterprises, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow, notwithstanding the chronic stresses and acute impacts01 experienced.\nIn 2013, Mexico City (CDMX) was selected to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative, pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, which seeks to help prepare cities to build urban resilience around the social, economic, and physical challenges of the 21st century (Figure 1).[2]\nThe 100RC initiative supports cities by financing and providing technical assistance, access to the services of globa organizations, opportunities to exchange experiences and best practices among member cities, and access to tools for building resilience.\nThe Government of Mexico City views participation in the 100RC initiative as an opportunity to share experiences and learn from other cities in the global\ncommunity and to build resilience to the chronic stresses and acute impacts associated with climate change and natural and man-made disasters.\nII\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGES IN CDMX\nRESILIENCE CHALLENGES IN CDMX\nOver time Mexico City has experienced a great social and environmental transformation, becoming the center of economic, political, and social-cultural activities in Mexico. A strong trend of population growth and expansion of its territory have given rise to pressing issues, such as intense demand for natural resources, inequality and social marginalization, informal settlements, waste generation, degradation of natural resources, and pollution.\nThese issues, however, have also generated a strong link between the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico (ZMVM)[3] 4 5and the Megalopolis,\u2122 due to\nintense collaboration and integration at urban, socioeconomic, and environmenta levels in the region.\nTo build resiliency, the past must be considered so that risks related with the city's history are better understood. For example, while the fact that most of the City is located on top of what used to be a lake must be considered, future scenarios must take into account the fact that social and environmental transformation continues to take place. Knowledge of both the past and the present is the foundation for a better understanding of the potential risks and unforeseen events that the City and its inhabitants may face.\n2.1.\tTHE GREAT TRANSFORMATION FROM LAKE TO MEGACITY\nMexico City is built on what used to be a lake, inside a drainless basin.\u2122 From pre-Colombian times, hydraulic projects took place to manage and control the lake's water level during rainy seasons, mitigate floods, and avoid mixing the salty water of Texcoco Lake with fresh water from the surrounding lakes.\nThese projects enabled a steady supply of water to the city's inhabitants. Altering lake systems defined a new relationship with the basin and created an acute water stress due to pressure for water resources from one of the world's most populated megacities (Figure 3).\n3.\tZMVM includes 16 Boroughs of CDMX (42 percent of the population), 59 municipalities of the State of Mexico (53 percent of the population) and 21 municipalities of Hidalgo State (5 percent of the population) (PUEC, 2012).\n4.\tCDMX is located in a megalopolitan area in the central part of the country, which includes: CDMX, the State of Mexico, Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Morelos, and Puebla. The 16 boroughs of CDMX, 29 municipalities of Hidalgo State, 80 municipalities of the State of Mexico, 33 municipalities of Morelos State, 22 municipalities of Puebla State, and the 60 municipalities of Tlaxcala State are represented in Megalopolis (in total, 16 boroughs and 224 municipalities [DOF, 2013]). As of 2010, Megalopolis had 29 million inhabitants, representing 29 percent of the total population of the country, concentrated in 4.4 percent of Mexican territory (INEGI, 2010).\n5.\tDrainless basin: area of rainwater drainage where water flows without an exit to the ocean (World Bank, 2013a).\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, giant drains, pits, and tunnels were built as flood protection, draining the lakes and carrying excess rainfall water out of the Valley of Mexico Basin. This type of flood protection ended with the construction of the \"Great Sewage Canal.\u201d[7] During the 1960s, 80 kilometers of rivers were covered and replaced with roads, a development that reflected the thinking of the times but resulted in a host of water-related issues.\nPopulation growth increased demand for this vital resource, which is why new, huge hydraulic works were built at a regional evel. Lerma System, which opened in 1952 and expanded in 1976 with the Cutzamala System, was built to import water from neighboring basins,\u2122 while new projects, such as the deep sewage system that was completed by 1975,\u2122 were built to drain gray water out of the Valley of Mexico Basin.\nDespite these projects, the water system has limited capacity and its sustainability is a huge challenge. Water losses of about 41.4 percent due to leaks from the potable water system are estimated, and reuse and water treatment systems are limited.\u2122\nTo face these challenges, some important projects currently under construction are aiming to address the future functioning of the hydraulic system of the Valley of the Mexico Basin.[11]\n2.2.\tCITY EXPANSION\nIn the 20th century, economic and demographic growth, augmented by migration from rural areas to the City, have resulted in enormous changes to the urban environment and in physical conurbation with ZMVM. Urban sprawl has spread, mainly to the northern and eastern parts of the city.\nBeginning in the 1990s, the greatest growth occurred in the northern part of the city, in the municipalities of the State of Mexico, in the central boroughs of CDMX, and in the Conservation Areas[12] (Figure 4). This growth has caused serious degradation of the strategic environmenta services that are meant to benefit people living and working in the city, such as aquifer recharge, biodiversity, and carbon uptake. In addition, population growth has resulted in informal settlements on hillsides with steep or unstable slopes, in flood prone areas, and in areas that are critical for aquifer recharge\u2122 (Figure 5).\nStarting in 1980, large investments in areas such as Santa Fe, which is west of the city, led to urban development.\nInsufficient urban planning for these areas has created significant mobility issues. The lack of planning has not only made CDMX one of the cities with the greatest traffic congestion in the world,[14] but has impacted the quality of life of thousands of inhabitants. Traffic issues are related to job distribution, and employment is concentrated in the central areas of ZMVM; only four of the city boroughs provide one-third of the employment at the metropolitan level\u2122 (Figure 6).\nAn estimated 4.5 million people commute daily to CDMX from the metropolitan area, primarily from the municipalities of the State of Mexico. This daily influx increases the demand on public transportation systems and traffic on the city's road network.\u2122 Reducing commute times between the places where people live and work by enhancing and expanding public transportation services is an enormous challenge.\nFigure 6.

Data created by a911 from DENUE, INEGI, 2010.\nIn addition, transportation is the greatest source of pollution in ZMVM, generating an estimated 46 percent of the polluting emissions (ozone precursors and particles) in ZMVMf171 Private transportation generates most of the ozone particulates,[l3] and after diesel, heavy transportation is the second-highest source of fine particulate emissions.\u2122 ZMVM's 5 million vehicles, with an annual growth rate of 3.8 percent, are one of the main causes of the emissions that impact air quality\u2122 in the city and the metropolitan area.\nMegacities have ever-expanding needs for public services and amenities. These needs make city and regional planning more complex and demand greater coordination at the metropolitan and regional levels as well as require important financial, human, and technological resources to address a broad spectrum of present and future challenges.\n2.3.\tSHOCKS AND STRESSES IN CDMX\nBuilding resilience at city and regional levels depends heavily on assessing vulnerabilities and historical impacts, understanding and interpreting future risk scenarios (for example, climate change\nscenarios), as well as understanding the socioeconomic and social-ecological processes that increase the vulnerabilities caused by the city's chronic stresses.\nSHOCKS\nCDMX is vulnerable to many risks of natural and human origin due to its geographic location and socioeconomic situation. In recent times, the city has been affected by various natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, and epidemics. 17 * 19 20\nFigure 7 shows the impacts of three types of shocks in terms of population affected and direct economic costs during the period from 1980 to 2013.\n17. Air Quality, consulted as of June 24, 2016.\n13. Tropospheric ozone is at surface level, produced at urban areas when nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) react in the atmosphere in the presence of solar light. In high concentration, human health and vegetation may be at risk (Air Quality, consulted as of June 24, 2016).\n19.\tSuspended particulates have diverse sources and compositions. Their size varies from 25 millimeter to some nanometer. They occur naturally or are caused by human activities; they may also be formed in the atmosphere due to chemical reactions (Air Quality, consulted as of June 24, 2016).\n20.\tCentro Mario Molina, 2016.\nFigure 7. Socioeconomic impacts of natural disasters in CDMX, with costs and affected population\/ areas from 1980 to 2O13[243\nn millions of $USD (average annual cost for 1980-2014)\nThe highest direct economic costs stem from damage during the 1985 earthquake. However, hydrometeorologic shocks have had more frequent impacts on the population; during the period from 1980 to 2013, more people were affected by hydrometeorologic shocks than were affected by the 1985 earthquake. Other shocks include heavy rains that can cause floods and destabilize hillsides; hail; heat waves; and strong winds that can damage infrastructure and cause buildings to collapse. Under climate change conditions, extreme hydrometeorologic events are expected to occur more frequently and with greater intensity in the city and the region\/2'3 as detailed below. 21 22 23 24\nFigure 8 summarizes the results from three exercises conducted during the strategy development portion of the Preliminary Resilience Assessment. The first exercise revealed how stakeholders from various sectors perceived the main asset impacts, shocks, and stresses identified during the workshop\/223 The second and third exercises presented the main shocks to the city, which were based on the views of stakeholders in the construction and insurance sectors\/233\n21.\tIPCC. 2014: SEDEMA. 2014.\n22.\tPerceptions related to shocks and stresses are the result of a workshop held on May 26, 2015, during Phase 1 of the Resilience Strategy development. Workshop attendees were government officers and representatives from the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the scientific community.\n23.\tResults of the study \"Capability Creation and Public Policy to Build Resiliency on Urban and Real Estate Infrastructure of Mexico City,\u201d conducted by Kuradzo Ingenieria Con Valor Ambiental S.C., with funding from the British Embassy\u2019s Prosperity Fund during 2015.\n24.\tAffected population includes injured, evacuated, wounded, and victims (SEDEMA, 2015). Social-economic impact is the current dollars in the year corresponding to an event. Banco de Mexico provided the average annual dollar cost for the period from 1980 to 2014. Social-economic impacts represent only direct costs (SEDEMA, 2015). Information is from the series Social-economic impact of Disasters in Mexico, published by CENAPRED. Data on impacts of the 1985 earthquake may be underestimated on Figure 8. See Figure 10 on the 1985 earthquake on page 33.\nAs previously stated, some of the identified shocks are related directly or indirectly with hydrometeorologic phenomena. On the other hand, social conflict is perceived as a high to medium-high risk given the frequency with which it occurs in the city; for example, in 2014, 97 demonstrations took place in the city, resulting in losses totaling 1,945.5 million pesos [25]. Similarly, a severe social conflict may put the provision of vital city services and the maintenance of strategic infrastructure, such as the public transportation system and the main network of roads, at great risk.\nEarthquakes were also considered a high to medium-high risk in all three exercises. Potential catastrophic events, such as the 1985 earthquake that caused serious damage to the city, were rated according to severity.\nFigure 9 shows a seismic risk map with Expected Annual Loss (PAE)[26] per neighborhood of losses corresponding to a typical portfolio of properties insured in CDMX. However, earthquakes are only one of those geologic risks to which the city is exposed.\n25.\tCAhJACC'. 2014.\n26.\tPAE is a mathematic average of annual loss for any probabilistic event, and it is calculated by adding the result between expected losses for a certain event and the probability of the occurrence of such event within 1 year. It is one of the risk estimation factors often used to define insurance premiums, for example, as it is easy to understand.\nFigure 10.1985 EARTHQUAKE\nThe 1985 earthquake, which caused heavy human and economic losses, was the most serious disaster in CDMX\u2019s recent history. The reconstruction costs were a great challenge for the city and the country1271. Estimates of damages from this earthquake vary significantly by source because most were created without a uniform methodology and were based on scattered, incomplete information:\nHUMAN LOSSES\nOfficial data on fatalities vary between 6,000 (CENAPRED, 2001) and 8,000 (CEPAL, 1985)\u2122.\nCOSTS DUE TO DAMAGES AND LOSSES\nEstimated costs range from $USD 4.1 million (CENAPRED, 2001) to\n$USD 8.3 billion (World Bank, 2012).\nAffected over 2.7% of the national GDP in 1985. (CENAPRED, 2001).\nINFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGES (CENAPRED 2001)\n36,000 homes destroyed\n65,000 homes with serious damage.\n3,300 large buildings damaged.\n1 out of 5 teaching facilities collapsed or damaged beyond repair.\n50 hospitals and health care centers damaged.\nConsiderable damages to the water supply, power and telecommunications networks\nSOCIAL IMPACT\n30,000 people injured (World Bank, 2012b).\n250,000 people with lost their homes (World Bank, 2012b).\n900,000 people with damage to their homes (World Bank, 2012b).\n150,000 unemployed people (CENAPRED, 2001).\nThere could be another disaster if another large-magnitude earthquake occurs. Continuous resilience building is key to protecting human lives, housing, strategic infrastructure, basic services such as potable water and sewage networks, the food supply, and the city\u2019s transportation network.\nIn addition to earthquakes, the exposure of CDMX to various geologic risks such as hillside movement, subsidence, and volcanic events is great.[29] The city is located on what is known as the \"Ring of Fire,\u201d where 80 percent of the world's seismic activity takes place, as well as on the country's volcanic range, where nine active volcanoes are located. Features of\nSTRESSES\nCDMX faces important stresses. Some of the most relevant were identified in a public outreach process with stakeholders from various sectors, and they were classified by their perceived level of risk (Figure 11).\nthe basin\u2019s soil types and overexploitation of the aquifer cause serious subsidence in the city, which affects infrastructure and housing, and also creates a dynamic vulnerability to a large-magnitude earthquake.[30]\nInequality, poverty, and wealth concentration are acknowledged as the main stresses, with a medium to high risk for the city. There is a high level of inequality in the city, which has a Gini coefficient of O.5O7.pl]\nThis is clearly reflected at a basic level, given that there is inequality in people's access to services, urban amenities, and quality housing between the eastern and western areas of the city as well as the outer areas of ZMVM.\nVulnerability to specific impacts varies, given that the capacity of people to respond to severe shocks and acute stresses varies from district to district. Nevertheless, CDMX is the second area in the country with the lowest poverty rate, with 28.5 percent of the population living in poverty and 2.2 percent, in extreme poverty.[32]\nWeak metropolitan coordination and the expansion of urban sprawl are stresses that strongly relate to metropolitan governance. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)[33] recognizes that the lack of a metropolitan view and the weakness\nof intergovernmental agreements for regional coordination on key issues, such as mobility, protection of natural resources, and water management, result in negative impacts to the quality of life of those who live and work in ZMVM.\nThere are socioeconomic and social-ecological processes driving city and regional vulnerability. Among those are: 1) historic population growth and urban sprawl, 2) weak urban planning and regional coordination, 3) degradation of strategic environmental services for the city's inhabitants, and 4) poverty and inequality clearly expressed in access to housing and urban amenities, and the status of vulnerable populations. All these stresses will be exacerbated by climate change. These processes must be understood if the city is to step up and adapt to the challenges they present.\n2.4.\tCLIMATE CHANGE\nClimate change poses risks to both human and natural systems in the 21st century. The 2014 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides conclusive evidence regarding potential shocks and their consequences for megacities such as CDMX. An increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events is expected, and these events may include severe floods, droughts, heat waves, and landslides (Figures 12 and 13).[34]\nFor CDMX, climate change scenarios show an increase of average temperatures within a range of 0.5 to 1.25 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) for colder months (December to February) in the short term (2030) and up to 2\u00b0C in the medium term (2050). For warmer months (April to June), an\nFigure 12. Rainfall predictions for CDMX[37]\nincrease of 125 to 150\u00b0C in the short term is foreseen, and up to 2.25\u00b0C in the medium term.p5]\nMexico City Climate Action Program (PACCM) 2014-2020[36] states that about 5.6 million people in the city are vulnerable to climate change and describes their economic and educational status, gender distribution, degree of dependence, geographic location, and other factors. Figure 12 shows rainfall predictions for CDMX.\nEXTREME RAINFALL AND FLOOD\nOne of the expected shocks associated with climate change is an increase in extreme rainfall that may result in an increased number of floods. Shocks to sewage systems are projected during intense rainfall seasons, and the frequency and extent of such shocks may increase significantly due to lack of infrastructure maintenance or as a result of future earthquakes, which may result in damaged infrastructure in the city.p8]\nSome of the most recurrent shocks in CDMX are the ponding of water and the floods that occur during the rainy season (May to August). Figure 14 shows areas in danger of flooding in CDMX. Although they only result in minor direct economic impacts, they severely affect mobility in the city and the entire metropolitan area\nand in doing so result in significant indirect economic losses.\nFlooding due to the collapse of the sewage system affects both the area near the current Mexico City International Airport (AICM) and the area where the New International Airport of Mexico City (NAICM) is being constructed.[39] Therefore, to increase the resilience of both CDMX and ZMVM, actions that improve the use and management of water resources and address climate change scenarios involving extreme rainfall are needed.\nDROUGHT\nAnother potential shock for the city that may result from climate change is a prolonged drought in the region that affects the Cutzamala system and therefore the water supply to ZMVM. From 2009 to 2011, a drought in northern and central Mexico impacted the availability of potable water for some areas of the city (specifically, Iztapalapa and Tlahuac) (Figure 15). After a number of tropical storms, the effects of the drought receded and adequate water levels in the reservoirs supplying the city and the metropolitan area were reestablished.[40]\nWater extraction is currently substantially greater than aquifer recharge in the Valley\nof Mexico. Estimates are that in about 30 to 40 years the Mexico Basin will gradually become impaired and will cease to be the main water source for CDMX. If extended droughts like those in Sao Paulo, Brazil, or in California, United States, were to occur in northern and central Mexico, sustainable aquifer management will be critical for water supply and resilience for the megacity and the region.\nPROLONGED DROUGHT CASE STUDY: LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A.\nSince 2012, California has experienced a historic drought (Figure 16). In January 2014, dams and rivers registered their lowest levels in history, and the state was declared to be in a state of emergency. The eastern Sierra Nevada, a region that supplies water to the city of Los Angeles, registered snow coverage that was 2 percent of normal, the lowest level in history.\u2122 Although 2015-2016 was expected to be a year with much rainfall due to the presence of El Nino, drought conditions still prevailed in almost all the state.\u2122\nWATER CONSERVATION\nIn April 2015, California's governor, Jerry Brown, issued an executive order to reduce use of potable water in urban areas by 25 percent, with specific reductions of 4 to 36 percent required for cities (relative to 2013 usage).\u2122The specific reduction required for the City of Los Angeles was 16 percent. However, water pressures in the city in previous years had forced local government to act. In October 2014, Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles, made a commitment to reduce water consumption per capita by 20 percent by 2017 and to realize a partial reduction of 10 percent by mid-2015. He also endeavored to reduce water imports by 50 percent by 2025 and replace this reduction by rainfall capture by 2035. [45] About 65 percent of the water in Los Angeles is used in homes. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) explains that it achieved its water consumption reduction goal by July 2015 as the result of the stringent restrictions it imposed on the use of water for gardening)\u2122\nINVESTMENT IN LOCAL WATER SOURCES\nLos Angeles seeks to develop local water sources that are drought-resilient. Between 2011 and 2015, 80 percent of the water used in Los Angeles was imported from the Sierra Nevada and the Colorado River. Due to impacts of climate change on these sources, Los Angeles is seeking new projects to recycle water and capture rainfall. Alternatives are also being investigated to recharge the San Fernando Valley aquifer with treated recycled water.[47]\nECONOMIC IMPACT\nDroughts have a significant impact on the agricultural sector, and these impacts create economic losses.[48] However, in the city the economic importance of the agricultural sector is relatively small,[49] and the industrial and commercial sectors, which tend to predominate in cities, are not directly affected by drought.[50] In Los Angeles, homeowners have experienced the greatest economic impacts of the drought because of rate increases.[51] However, LADWP has also been affected: Restrictions on water consumption reduce revenues for LADWP even though the transaction costs of the water system have been fixed.\nIll\nDEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nIII. DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nIn the last few years, the Mexico City Government has implemented strategies, programs, and projects to address resilience issues in various sectors (Figure 17). These actions have provided a basis for the implementing comprehensive risk management, development planning, and institutional responses to climate change as priorities to CDMX and have contributed to building resilience.\nThe Mexico City Climate Action Program 2014-2020 prioritizes building resilience at both the city and the societal level and focuses on reducing the vulnerability of people in poverty, as they are often the most vulnerable to these events, given the degree to which their quality of life and basic goods (home, health, education) are affected by such events. The Resilience Strategy seeks to strengthen city programs and projects designed to build resilience.\n3.1\tCONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR CITY RESILIENCE\nThe CRF is a tool that the Rockefeller Foundation developed in collaboration with Arup[52] to identify the features of a resilient city (Figure 18). The goal of the CRF is to identify the ways that cities around the world can assess and analyze resilience in a more uniform way. The CRF also helps compare and contrast resilience among the various cities involved in the 100RC initiative.\nThe CRF tool is made up of 4 dimensions, 12 drivers, and 50 sub-drivers that help to articulate the process that cities use to assess their capacities connected to resilience building (Figure 18).\nThe CRF was used to develop a strategy\nto inform the methodology for design and collection of data and perceptions from stakeholders. With this strategy, the main results for the shocks, stresses, strengths, and weaknesses of a city could be illustrated as they relate to resilience.\nAlso guiding the design of the Resilience Strategy are the seven qualities described in the table on the following page.\nRESILIENCE QUALITIES\nThe Resilience Strategy process should attract a wide, diverse group of stakeholders, including those that are most vulnerable to shocks and stresses, to ensure transparency and collective responsibility. Methods to encourage commitment should reflect opportunities for collective cooperation to help ensure that the strategy results in an approach that considers and sets priorities for the resilience needs of various sectors and groups of stakeholders. The Resilience Strategy should also be clearly organized and documented to guarantee that all stakeholders understand and have access to it.\nThe Resilience Strategy process and results should be built on continuous supplemental efforts. Instead of creating additional work and conflict for stakeholders, the strategy should be developed to help cities to align with and make the best of existing and new initiatives and priorities. The strategy should also ensure management of the relationship between and interdependence of initiatives and the risks to be addressed.\nThe Resilience Strategy should be developed from a clear, rigorous process that brings together commonly accepted quantitative and qualitative approaches. 100RC should provide best practices to guide the development of the strategy.\nThe Resilience Strategy should take into account city resource restrictions and should seek innovative options to overcome them.\nThe Resilience Strategy should be designed to capture lessons learned, new or updated information, reevaluations, and constant change. Mechanisms should allow for ongoing evolution; cities should be able to make decisions based on historical experiences and information and in real time.\nThe Resilience Strategy should have multiple initiatives to ensure that cities have redundant capacities to address the various needs of resilience.\nThe Resilience Strategy should have the flexibility to adapt to events and unforeseen changes in context and new perils, situations, data and stakeholders. The strategy should provide an adaptive management cycle that takes into account successes and failures, best practices, experiences, and approaches, both internally and in other cities. Such inputs should be periodically reevaluated to reinforce strategic priorities and adjust implementation approaches.\n3.2\tSTRATEGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nThe preparation of a Resilience Strategy in the 100RC Network follows a consistent methodology through three phases of work that started in March 2015 (Figure 19). The strategy development process was a participatory process that approached and consulted with stakeholders in the public sector, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and the scientific community to ensure inclusion of various perspectives, priorities, and information sources. All stakeholders provided valuable information that contributed to an exchange of local knowledge and the creation of resilience priorities that must be addressed.\nDuring Phase I, participants reviewed government documents and literature and\nconducted semi-structured interviews, surveys, workshops, and meetings with subject-matter experts to identify and understand the main stresses, shocks, and assets of the cit[53]. The information was presented in a Preliminary Resilience Evaluation, which identified six focal areas. These six areas were studied in more depth in Phase II.\nDuring Phase II, work groups consisting of subject-matter experts from various sectors were established to develop the issues and areas of opportunity specific to the six focal areas.[54]\nIntegration of stakeholders and programs of various sectors to establish an approach to the Resilience Strategy for the city\n\u2022\tStakeholder mapping\n\u2022\tActions inventory\n\u2022\tResilience perception analysis\n\u2022\tSelection of focus areas to be developed in the following phases.\nWork to expand knowledge about focus areas and create:\n\u2022\tResilience diagnosis for CDMX\n\u2022\tRisks and opportunities assessment\n\u2022\tIdentification of priorities and resilience tools\n\u2022\tIdentification of incentives and specific barriers linked to strategy implementation.\n\u2022\tImplementation of actions established in Resilience Strategy.\n\u2022\tResilience communication campaign for CDMX inhabitants.\n53.\tDuring Phase 1,11 interviews, 17 surveys, and 2 workshops were conducted (a Perceptions workshop with 20 attendees and an Assets, Stresses, and Shocks workshop with 27 attendees); 146 individuals and 290 actions were identified as contributing to resilience development in CDMX.\n54.\tDuring Phase II, three workshops were conducted and working sessions with the responsible parties for each work group were held.\nBy combining the results of Phases I and II, weaknesses, areas of opportunities, the relationship between shocks and stresses, and the actions that should be fostered to address the main resilience challenges faced by CDMX were identified. From this process, it was determined that five pillars needed to be considered:\nFOSTER REGIONAL COORDINATION\nPROMOTE WATER RESILIENCE AS A NEW PARADIGM TO MANAGE WATER IN THE MEXICO BASIN\nPLAN FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL RESILIENCE\nIMPROVE MOBILITY THROUGH AN INTEGRATED, SAFE, AND SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM\nDEVELOP INNOVATION AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY\nAs part of the development process for the Resilience Strategy, there has been participation in international activities, including the following:\nWorld Summit on Resilience\t\tCOP 21\t\tExchange of experience among Resilience Directors in Rotterdam\t\tARISE Initiative\nWORLD SUMMIT ON RESILIENCE\nIn November 2015, CDMX hosted the Second Global Summit of Resilience Directors. Participants included resilience directors from about 50 cities from around the world, 100RC global initiative staff, and 100RC Platform Partners members. The objective of the summit was to share experience about the initiatives taken, the barriers encountered, and the solutions that overcame the barriers in the cities in the 100RC Network. The summit also highlighted how resilience directors from around the world have come to lead construction efforts.\nDuring the event, CDMX served as a living laboratory where participants experienced diverse resilience challenges and observed how the city has fostered innovative initiatives to address its challenges and needs. The Mayor, heads and officers of various CDMX government secretariats, Resilience Directors from various cities around the world, and representatives of international organizations took part in this event.\nDuring the summit, participants discussed the resilience challenges posed by the current Mexico City International Airport and brought their diverse experience and points of view to the subject. Topics addressed included ways to incorporate resilience elements into the project in the context of the needs of the population and the city's chronic stresses and acute shocks. Participants also identified key topics that should be taken into account in the project, including social inclusion, comprehensive mobility, water management, seismic risk management, and opportunities to reduce social inequality.\nCOP 21\nIn December 2015, during the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France, the CDMX government presented a paper entitled The View of Mexico City on Climate Change to 2025 e[55]. The paper discussed the progress that the city has made on climate policy and its vision for 2025 on mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. The paper also highlights a preliminary vision of a Resilience Strategy to reduce vulnerability in the face of social, economic, and environmental threats. The inclusion of resilience in this paper illustrated CDMX's commitment to strengthen city resilience and to be a global leader on this issue.\nEXPERIENCE EXCHANGE AMONG RESILIENCE DIRECTORS IN ROTTERDAM\nFrom October 5 to 9, 2015, an exchange of resilience ideas and experience took place under 100RC auspices in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The exchange focused on identifying best practices by cities to manage water resources and build resilience. Resilience Directors and officers from Bangkok (Thailand); Berkeley, CA (USA); Mexico City (Mexico); New Orleans, LA (USA); Norfolk, VA (USA); Rome (Italy); Rotterdam; Surat (India); and Vejle (Denmark) attended the exchange. These cities face common challenges regarding water management. During the exchange, innovations implemented in Rotterdam for multidisciplinary infrastructure were explored. Among the innovations were water squares and underground parking lots that can retain and store water during intense rainfall events to mitigate the risk of floods while providing public space.[56]\nARISE INITIATIVE\nCDMX has been chosen to be part of the ARISE Initiative for Private-Sector Alliance for Resilient Societies before Disasters. This initiative, which is promoted by United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), is designed to foster collaboration with private-sector entities to build city resilience. ARISE initiative activities have been integrated into the CDMX Resilience Strategy.\n3.3\tINSTITUTIONALIZATION OF RESILIENCE\nThe development and implementation of the Resilience Strategy has been driven by the Resilience Steering Committee, which was created under the mandate of the Federal District Inter-Institutional Climate Change Commission (CICCDF)[57], pursuant to Article 11, Fraction XIII of the Federal District Act for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation and Sustainable Development. The Resilience Steering Committee is made up of a group of stakeholders who represent various sectors (Figure 20) and have contributed to the development of the Resilience Strategy with review and validation of documents, activities, and strategy design in preparation for submittal to CICCDF.\nFigure 20. Structure of the Resilience Steering Committee\nThe CDMX commitment to implement actions to build a Resilience Strategy has been demonstrated by the signing of a 100RC commitment declaration that states that the city will allocate 10 percent of its annual budget to support resilience measures in the city. As a result of this commitment, 100RC ensured financing of up to $USD 5 million for Platform Partners services until 2020 to support the city\u2019s efforts to build resilience.\nThe commitment declaration was signed by Dr. Miguel Angel Mancera, the Mayor of Mexico City, during the lOORC-sponsored Second Global Summit of Resilience Directors. With this agreement, the mayor requested that the activities that are developed as part of this initiative be monitored.\nIV\nA VISION TO BUILD RESILIENCE IN CDMX\nRESILIENT CDMX\nMexico City creates an equitable society using an all-embracing adaptive process in which various stakeholders, sectors, and vulnerable groups foster a transformation to face the main social, economic, and environmental challenges of the 21st century.\nThe CDMX Resilience Strategy is an opportunity to bring together a vision to build resilience and to guide government, the private sector, civil society, and the scientific community to respond to the main shocks and stresses that the city faces in a cross-functional, integrated, and multilevel approach (at the community, local, city, and regional levels).\nThe pillars and actions of the Resilience Strategy seek to contribute to the creation of a more equitable CDMX and to focus on the population that is most affected by the city's many present or potential perils. Inequality manifests in various ways in the city (for example, in unequal access to services, urban amenities, housing, and employment). Likewise, vulnerability and adaptive capacity to various risks are not the same for different parts of the population. For this reason, the Resilience Strategy acknowledges such differences and seeks to benefit vulnerable groups through the proposed goals and actions.\nResilience is built through an all-embracing process that considers the views of stakeholders from the various levels of government and members of the scientific\ncommunity, civil society, corporations, representatives of the private sector, and multilateral and bilateral cooperative organizations. It is important to foster cooperation among these stakeholders through coalitions of organizations with shared goals and actions to build resilience.\nThe Resilience Strategy drives an adaptive transformation by fostering a change of paradigm so that the development process transcends traditional frameworks to face complex problems and to design, modify, and implement public policies by cross-functional planning. To achieve this end, continuous learning and frequent review of plans and actions are required. The commitment to this type of learning and review is an acknowledgment of the seriousness of the city's social-environmental challenges and the opportunities the city has to make real progress on sustainable social and economic activities that can transform its future.\nV\nRESILIENCE\nSTRATEGY\nV. RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nThe goal of the Resilience Strategy for CDMX is to identify opportunities and define priorities for building city resilience. The strategy's vision must be broad and ambitious to respond to the city's existing challenges. To address the main challenges outlined in Chapter II, Resilience Challenges in CDMX, the Resilience Strategy incorporated five\npillars, each of which has distinct goals, actions, and activities.\nTo define the goals and actions for each pillar, certain overarching concepts were established.\nBUILDING RESILIENCE IN SPECIFIC AREAS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL\nVULNERABLE\nGROUPS\nThe distribution of stresses and shocks in some communities is concentrated spatially. In the short and medium term, actions, innovations, and resource alignment are needed to increase resilience at the community level if such actions are to be replicated in other areas of the city and region. There is a great diversity of programs and actions that may, with some modifications, increase resilience at the community level.\nShocks and stresses must be considered concurrently, as there is a close relationship between them. This close relationship is evident in the varying effects that result from the different adaptive capacities of different groups in the population. For example, poverty, marginalization, and gender differences limit the adaptive capacity of the population to face disasters, and this limited adaptive capacity increases their vulnerability. Therefore, actions must identify vulnerable groups and build resilience at the community level.\nEDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION\nREGIONAL\nPERSPECTIVE\nThe preparation of educational messages and the design of communication campaigns around resilience are designed as elements to increase understanding by key stakeholders and society and to foster citizen involvement in resilience building.\nTo build a culture of resilience at both the metropolitan and the megalopolitan level, input from a regional perspective must be sought and included.\nACTIONS\nThree types of actions are included in this Resilience Strategy:\n1.\tActions and activities that are conducted by organizations or institutions of government, the private sector, civil society, or the scientific community that are identified by their value to building resilience in the city.\n2.\tActions and activities that are noted for their relevance because they bring cross-resilience principles or have a significant positive impact on city and regional development.\n3.\tActions and activities that have a resilience value. These actions are divided into two types:\nActions and activities in the planning process that require support to implement.\nActions and activities that have not yet been implemented, but that are suggested for the future because they represent an opportunity to build resilience.\nThe period in which an action is to take place is described as follows:\n1.\tShort term (2016-2018): Actions already under way or about to start, but that will be concluded during the current administration.\n2.\tMedium term (2016-2025): Actions that will need to be continued into the future to be effective despite political-administrative changes.\n3.\tLong term (2016-2040): Actions that will require longer planning and implementation processes that are responding to a vision of resilience related to transformation toward the sustainability of the city and the region.\nThree types of stakeholders are involved in actions and activities:\nResponsible parties: Government entities in charge of developing an action that have the task of reporting progress within the monitoring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) mechanism.\nParticipants: Other government entities involved in developing an action or a specific activity.\nPartners: Members of private-sector, civil society, academic, or international organizations that contribute to the development of actions or activities.\nThe Resilience Strategy is an ever-changing document that requires ongoing assessment and that incorporates a earning process that allows for responses to a dynamic context. Due to the scope of a Resilience Strategy, this document could not include all the issues that might be relevant to building resilience.\nTherefore, regular reviews must be conducted to ensure that goals and actions are evaluated and updated. An MRV system will be implemented to support regular evaluations, continuous learning, and reflection on building resilience, specifically for communities and vulnerable groups.\nSTRATEGIC\nPILLARS\nNext, the strategic pillars are introduced with a selection of actions and some activities identified as examples of initiatives to be driven by the Resilience Strategy. All actions are shown in Appendix: Pillars, Vision, Goals, Actions, and Activities of the Resilience Strategy\nVISION: The ZMVM and the wider megalopolis operate under a regional institutional framework on key topics to maintain a common agenda and ensure shared responsibility in building resilience\n1.1: Create resilience through institutional coordination and regional strategic communication.\n1.2.\tGuide and support regional projects that contribute to resilience.\nPILLAR\n02\nPROMOTE WATER RESILIENCE AS A NEW PARADIGM TO MANAGE WATER IN THE MEXICO BASIN\nVISION: To respond to the risks and shocks associated with climate change and social and environmental pressures, and to ensure equity in water access and water security for all who live and work in CDMX, the city manages water resources in the Mexico Basin based on the principles of the Comprehensive Management of City Water Resources (GIRHU) process.\n2.1.\tReduce water scarcity and access inequality.\n2.2.\tPromote\nsustainable use of the aquifer and contribute to water security planning.\n2.3.\tFoster a civic culture on the sustainability of water\nresources.\n2.4.\tIntegrate a water-\nsensitive approach to urban design through blue and green\ninfrastructure.\nPILLAR\n03\nPLAN FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL RESILIENCE\nVISION: All CDMX citizens have equal access to urban amenities, housing, green areas and public spaces; the environment is improved; and risks are mitigated through sustainable management of natural resources.\n3.1: Increase spatial social equality in CDMX through programs and projects.\n3.2.\tProtect Conservation Areas.\n3.3.\tReduce risk through urban and regional planning.\nIMPROVE MOBILITY THROUGH AN\npillar\tINTEGRATED, SAFE, AND SUSTAINABLE\n04\nSYSTEM\nVISION: CDMX and the metropolitan area have an integrated mobility system that prioritizes public transportation over private vehicles and provides a safe urban environment for pedestrians and cyclists.\n4.1: Promote an integrated mobility system that connects and revitalizes CDMX and ZMVM.\n4.2: Discourage the use of private vehicles.\n4.3: Create a safe and accessible city for pedestrians and cyclists.\n4.4: Prepare the mobility system for the potential risks and effects of climate change.\n4.5: Promote the use of data to improve decision making on mobility.\nPILLAR\n05.\nDEVELOP INNOVATION AND ADAPTATIVE CAPACITY\nVISION: CDMX adapts to the impacts of climate change and responds proactively and innovatively to dynamic risks of natural and social origin.\n5.1: Integrate the principles of resilience in public facilities, investments, and new strategic projects, and promote private-sector participation in building resilience.\n5.2: Promote community resilience through citizen participation, strategic communication, and education.\n5.3: Review and adjust the regulatory framework to promote the implementation of adaptative measures.\nPROBLEM DESCRIPTION\nThe megalopolitan area at center of the country includes Mexico City, the States of Mexico, Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Morelos, and Puebla (Figure 21). Historically, this area has been the dominant area in the country in economic, social, and political terms. This metropolitan area consists of the 16 boroughs that constitute Mexico City and 224 municipalities in other states)58 59 60 61 62 63\nCDMX maintains a dynamic relationship between the city and its megalopolitan region in terms of the movement of the population and movement within the transportation system. For example, 40 percent of metropolitan area inhabitants have to cross at least one municipal border to get to their workplace)666 The corridor Mexico-Puebla registers about 760,000 people traveling daily, and 24 percent of the goods bought and sold in the city come from other parts of the region)6'3\nThis close relationship between CDMX and its surrounding metropolitan area means that many challenges must be addressed jointly to keep the city functioning.\nStrategic issues such as water resources management, mobility, territorial planning, conservation of natural resources, and biodiversity share a regional view. For example, the water used in CDMX metropolitan areas, Toluca, and Cuernavaca depends greatly on the Water Forest, an aquifer recharge area that is shared by three states)63\nGiven that the rivers, aquifers, air, and commuters in ZMVM extend beyond political borders, the management of resources has to be organized at the metropolitan and megalopolitan levels)63 as such management would be limited in scope without a regional approach.\nIn addition, the large number of administrative stakeholders makes the design and implementation of public policies and regional planning difficult. As a result, the governance structure in the region is fragmented)63 The CDMX Resilience Strategy must be implemented at multiple levels, from local to regional.\n58.\tThe 224 municipalities consist of the 29 municipalities in Hidalgo, 80 in the State of Mexico, 33 in Morelos, 22 in Puebla, and 60 in Tlaxcala (DOF, 2013).\n59.\tOCDE, 2015.\n60.\tCentro Mario Molina, 2012.\n61.\tCDMX, Morelos and State of Mexico (ECOBA, 2012).\n62.\tPUEC, 2012.\n63.\tOCDE. 2015.\nGOAL 1.1.\nCreate resilience through institutional coordination and regional strategic communication.\nACTION TO.\nFoster resilience integration in regional programs.\nIntegrating resilience into regional programs allows for priority issues to be addressed in a way that strengthens projects and policies related to management and reduction of risks and social vulnerability in a crosscutting manner that brings together multiple sectors. Examples of this type of integration are the reactivation of the COMETRAVI and integration of a potential guiding principle of resilience in the upcoming POZMVM.\nResponsible Parties: OR\nPartners AECOM, Iniciativa ARISE Period 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nBy considering resilience principles from a regional view, this action would strengthen state capacities for risk prevention, attention to vulnerable groups, and reduction of inequality in access to basic services. Realization of these values would increase integration and social inclusion.\nACTION 1.1.2.\nDrive and support the creation of a national resilience agenda with Mexican cities belonging to 100RC Network.\nCurrently, four Mexican cities belong to the 100RC network: CDMX (2013), Ciudad Juarez (2014), Colima (2016), and the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (2016). These four cities have an opportunity to share their experiences and best practices and to foster a nationa resilience agenda that could serve as a guide for the implementation of actions in other cities that are not members of the 100RC network. This sharing of resilience experiences and best practices could boost domestic capacity to prevent, identify, mitigate, adapt to, and manage climate shocks and stresses and in the process build national resilience.\nResponsible Parties: OR,\n100RC, Embajada de Holanda Period 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThe creation of a national resilience agenda would allow for consideration of resilience principles in sectoral plans. This approach would favor comprehensive planning in the ong term. The implementation of projects and actions based on comprehensive planning would improve the quality of life in Mexican cities and provide cities with capacity to anticipate and respond to various shocks and stresses.\nINSPIRATION: THE NATURAL DISASTER RESILIENCE COMPETITION (NDRC)\n- UNITED STATES.\nIn June 2015, 40 states and cities in the United States that had suffered from a natural disaster between 2011 and 2013 were invited to compete for $USD 1 billion to finance disaster recovery and foster long-term community resilience. Among the winners were the states of California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Virginia and the cities of New Orleans, Springfield, MA, and New York.\nThe process conducted for this competition was unique in that:\n\u2022\tA competition method was used to allocate federal funds.\n\u2022\tMultidisciplinary groups of subject-matter experts were organized to work directly with teams to develop their proposals.\n\u2022\tProposed projects had to involve various organizations and prove that diverse financing sources were used to prepare the project.\n\u2022\tPhilanthropic partners were included to provide resources to build capacity. These partners worked individually with the teams.\n\u2022\tLeadership was available at the federal level, as demonstrated by a commitment to change the manner that budgets for disasters are prepared.\nBecause four Mexican cities are currently part of the 100RC Network, this initiative offers an example of how collaboration can be fostered on a national scale to build resilience.\nGOAL 1.2.\nDrive and support regional projects that contribute to resilience.\nACTION 12.1\nStrengthen projects that foster conservation of ecosystems.\nThis action would protect natural areas and Conservation Areas by developing restoration, recovery, and maintenance projects to preserve the stability of ecosystems and provide ecosystem services in natural areas.\nResponsible Parties: Federal District Inter-Institutional Climate Change Commission, Conservation International\nPartners: LANCIS-UNAM\nPeriod 2016 - 2040\nResilience Value:\nConservation of ecosystems reduces their vulnerability and physical exposure to extreme weather events and contributes to their basic needs by protecting and restoring critical environmental assets.\nINSPIRATION FROM MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA: METROPOLITAN FOREST.\nThe Melbourne Resilience Strategy fosters the creation of a metropolitan forest using conservation and reforestation projects that involve all municipalities in the region under a common framework. The strategy seeks to capitalize on the benefits realized by keeping green areas at a metropolitan scale.\nACTION 1.2.2.\nReduce pollution in the region (air, water, solid waste, and chemical waste, among others).\nMeasures to counter air pollution will be continued through initiatives such as Program to Improve the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Zone Air Quality (PROAIRE) 2011-2020. Other regional programs that will be championed will help reduce pollutants in water and soil and conduct appropriate waste management activities.\nResponsible Parties: Autoridades ambientales estatales Partners LANCIS- UNAM Period 2016 - 2040\nResilience Value:\nBy reducing pollution at the regional level, the quality of life, the health of inhabitants in the megalopolis, and ecosystems are improved; opportunities for clean development are also created.\nACTION 1.2.3.\nFoster resilient infrastructure projects that contribute to the development of the region.\nAs part of this action, measures that increase resilience with regard to regional infrastructure projects will be implemented. An example of this type of resilient infrastructure project is the New International Airport of Mexico City and the adaptive use of the current Mexico City International Airport (see Figure 22).\nResponsible Parties: OR\nPartners: 100RC\nPeriod: 2016 - 2018\nFigure 22. Location Map for AICM and NAICM\nResilience Value:\nThe development of this action would encourage the implementation of large infrastructure projects that generate multiple design benefits, drive sustainable transformation in the region, and foster social and economic development.\nDespite significant efforts by government departments and agencies at both the local and federal levels, water security of CDMX and ZMVM is at risk due to the severe degradation of water resources, including the groundwater, in the Mexico Basin. Currently, the drinking water supply for all the city's inhabitants and for the development of socioeconomic activities is at risk because, over time, complex and interdependent factors have created a crisis.\nAmong the factors that have contributed to increasing water demand in the ZMVM are the following: loss of 41.4 percent of water in leaks from the drinking water distribution system)673 population growth in the city and the expansion of urban sprawl; 3683 population growth in the city and the expansion of urban sprawl, and the lack of awareness of the impacts of excessive consumption by some sectors of the population.3693\nWhile the average water capacity per capita in the country is 140,623 ft3\/person\/ year, it is only 5,367 ft3\/person\/year in CDMX. The disparity in per capita capacity is an indicator of the great stress that the city's water system is experiencing)703\nDisparities by area exist because water scarcity is reflected in service rotation and poor water quality, particularly in low-income areas in the eastern portion of the city (Tlahuac and Iztapalapa) and elevated areas on the hillsides and surrounding mountains.3733\nThe city has met the ever-growing need for water through overexploitation of the city\u2019s shallow aquifer. The overexploitation has upset the water balance, as the extraction from the aquifer has exceeded the aquifer's ability to recharge by infiltration, and this has caused a significant differential subsidence in CDMX and ZMVM.\nSuch subsidence can vary from 4 to 36 cm\/year3723 in different areas. It is estimated that the center of CDMX has experienced up to 10 meters of subsidence over the past 6 decades)733 subsidence which has damaged infrastructure and buildings and resulted in high repair costs.[74]\nDifferential subsidence and inadequate solid waste management have caused drainage infrastructure to lose the ability to evacuate rainwater)753 To address these problems, complex and costly infrastructure projects such as the East\nSimilarly, the use of large volumes of water, and the inability to recycle and reuse that water, generates a large volume wastewater, most of which does not receive adequate treatment. Consequently, wastewater strongly affects environmental quality at the discharge zones.[76] The Atotonilco treatment plant is being built to address this problem.\nIn general, the challenge of water security in CDMX, both in terms of supply as well as drainage and treatment, has required large infrastructure projects and major political, institutional, financial, and technical efforts. To address the challenge, CDMX\nhas developed a set of guidelines and strategies for different integrated projects, such as the Program of Integrated Water Resources (2012) and the Water Plan for the Future of CDMX (2014).\nGiven the complexity of the situation, efforts must continue to develop a GIRHU strategy that achieves water security for CDMX through a stable and systematic process. To achieve this, the Resilience Strategy aims to identify a set of goals that promote actions that will build the resilience necessary to achieve each goal, despite significant risks and unknown obstacles.\nGOAL 2.1.\nReduce water scarcity and access inequality.\nACTION 2.1.1.\nIntegrate the majority of the population without regular and continuous water service to the water supply system.\nThrough the expansion of the primary drinking water network, the supply to periurban communities and difficult-to-reach areas will be increased.\nResponsible Parties: SACMEX Partners BM, BID Period 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThrough this action, the unequal distribution of water resources is reduced.\nACTION 2.1.2.\nPromote public, economic, regulatory, and political instruments to reduce water scarcity and inequality.\nAdjust fees to the amount of water consumed in households, so that the costs of operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of infrastructure are covered, the quality of service improves, and user awareness of excessive water use increases. Fees will reflect the cost of service, which will be accessible to all.\nResilience Value:\nThis action helps raise awareness of the true value of water and helps regulate its daily consumption. It also ensures maintenance of critical water infrastructure and reduces pressure on the scarce resource.\nResponsible Parties: SACMEX Partners BID Period 2016 - 2025\nACTION 2.1.3.\nPromote the establishment of temporary rainwater catchment systems and water \u201ckiosks\u201d in areas and houses with a scarcity of water.\nThe installation of rainwater catchment systems temporarily supplies water to households that do not yet have access to the water network.\nResponsible Parties: SEDESO Partners Isla Urbana, CEMEX, CAF Period: 2016 - 2018\nResilience Value:\nThis action guarantees access to basic water service in underserved areas through a flexible system and helps to ensure continuous service in areas with limited access.\nGOAL 2.2.\nPromote sustainable use of the aquifer and contribute to water security planning.\nACTION 2.2.1\nSupport the creation and consolidation of the CDMX Water Fund.\nThe international organization The Nature Conservancy (TNC), on behalf of the Latin American Water Funds Partnership, with support from the government of CDMX, and in partnership with other organizations, is structuring a Water Fund for CDMX.\nResponsible Parties: TNC, on behalf of the Latin American Water Funds Partnership\nParticipants: SEDEMA, SACMEX Partners: Fundacion Kaluz, Banamex, Fundacion FEMSA, Fundacion Gonzalo Rio Arronte, BID.\nPeriod 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThis initiative contributes to the city's capacity to adapt to climate change because it promotes the integrity of ecosystems and maximizes their hydrological functions. In addition, it helps make the city's drinking water supply system a more robust and redundant system that will protect the city during droughts and other disruptions of the Cutzamala System, and prepare the city for growth in demand.\nACTION 2.2.2.\nInnovate in the maintenance and renovation of the water network and drainage system as well as in water reuse and treatment.\nAging water infrastructure of CDMX calls for a structural maintenance and modernization program for the drinking water distribution network to ensure efficient and quality service to the entire population.\nResponsible Parties: SACMEX Partners WB Period 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nModernizing the management of the water distribution network will make it more robust and redundant, and will help CDMX advance water security for its inhabitants.\nACTION 2.2.3.\nIdentify optimal investments for water resilience and develop public policy recommendations.\nThe World Bank implements the Decision Tree tool to support decision making under risk and uncertainty constraints. Using the tool, different agencies can improve the water resource planning process, prioritize capital investments, and improve project design. For example, this type of tool can more accurately track the progress of adaptive transformation in preparing for a drought by identifying optimal investments and necessary institutional changes.\nResponsible Parties: SACMEX Partners WB Period 2016 - 2018\nResilience Value:\nIt contributes to the institutionalization of a thoughtful decision-making process to develop quantitative and qualitative scenarios; it is flexible because it generates different types of alternatives; innovative, as it offers options that may not have been contemplated before; and integrated, as it coordinates and prioritizes actions between different actors.\nACTION 2.2.4.\nImprove the quality and quantity of water in the area of aquifer recharge.\nThrough conservation efforts and improvements in water management, such as forest maintenance, reforestation, and retention in recharge areas, the quality and quantity of the water supplied to CDMX and ZMVM will be improved.\nResponsible Parties: Conservation\nInternational\nPartners TNC\nPeriod 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThis action fosters the recovery of watersheds that supply water to the city, which enhances ecosystem benefits and increases the water security of the Mexico Basin.\nACTION 2.2.5.\nPrevent damages to the water infrastructure in the event of a major earthquake.\nThe vulnerability of water infrastructure in the event of a large-magnitude earthquake has been identified. Because the scale of damage that could occur is unknown, the most vulnerable areas must be identified, the drinking water network must be continuously monitored and maintained, and the resources to properly respond if an earthquake occurs must be available.\nResponsible Parties: SACMEX Period 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nIdentifying vulnerabilities in CDMX's hydraulic infrastructure in the event of an earthquake is a key element of a risk management plan, which also includes a preventive maintenance investment program. Both elements are critical to making the system more robust and redundant.\nACTION 2.2.6.\nIdentify the opportunities and shocks of mega-infrastructure projects on water security.\nThe impacts of megaprojects in the region will be assessed, including the urban development in regional areas, which is not only increasing the demand for water but also increasing wastewater generation in the area. The impacts of megaprojects must be considered in the development of the GIRHU strategy for the region.\nResponsible Parties: SACMEX Partners Veolia y RMS Period 2016 - 2018\nResilience Value:\nUnderstanding the increasing impacts of water demand and wastewater generation in areas affected by megaprojects and capitalizing on opportunities to build water resilience will help produce a more robust, redundant, and socially inclusive water resource management system.\nGOAL 2.3.\nFoster a civic culture on the sustainability of water resources.\nACTION 2.3.1.\nIncrease education in schools on responsible water use.\nThe considerable subsidization of water consumption in some areas of the city and the lack of user awareness about the vulnerability of water resources are factors that contribute to excessive water usage. Educational programs in schools that teach children how to reduce their water consumption should be established, as children and can set an example for their families.\nResponsible Parties: SEDEMA Partners IDB Period 2016 - 2040\nResilience Value:\nThis action promotes community participation and helps citizens become more aware of the value of water resources, which can result in reduced waste and more appropriate and responsible water consumption in the future.\nGOAL 2.4.\nIntegrate a water sensitive approach to urban design through blue and green infrastructure.\nACTION 2.4.1.\nPromote the restoration of bodies of water and watersheds.\nRegenerating and restoring natural water bodies and watersheds can prevent flooding and encourage adaptation to droughts caused by climate change.\nResponsible Parties: SEDEMA Partners: TNC, Lancis-UNAM, Dutch Embassy, Deltares\nPeriod 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nEnvironmental cleanup of watersheds and rivers and the production and management of green infrastructure have a number of environmental, economic, and social benefits that contribute to meeting the basic needs of the population, to enriching natural assets, and to strengthening adaptive capacities in the event of a decrease in the water supply.\nACTION 2.4.2.\nDevelop rainwater catchment, retention, regulation and infiltration, and flood prevention alternatives.\nProjects using various green and blue infrastructure methodologies and technologies can capture rainwater and retain it for later use, and infiltrate it into aquifers. Such projects also seek to build inclusive public spaces and at the same time promote education and awareness about water conservation in cities.\nResponsible Parties: SEDEMA y AEP Partners Deltares, BID, Veolia, CAF, Isla Urbana\nPeriod 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThis action helps reduce the negative impacts of floods, especially in rainy seasons. Additionally, by creating more green spaces for recreation and public enjoyment, this action has social benefits that improve social cohesion.\nNEW ORLEANS INSPIRATION.\nThrough green infrastructure projects, the city of New Orleans is demonstrating how unused space can be used to store rainwater and is transforming vacant lots into gardens that capture rainwater and remove contaminants. These projects offer other benefits, as they result in more attractive neighborhoods wherever they are developed.\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nThe impacts associated with urban growth in recent decades have created major challenges for land use and urban planning in CDMX and ZMVM. Urban resilience is designed to promote an equitable, safe, and connected city through the design of programs, projects, and urban policies that use a comprehensive approach l[77] 78 79 80 81 82,to promote a better quality of life despite the size and complexity of the territory.\nThe concentration of companies and work in the central city areas generates social inequality and hinders access to basic services for part of the population (Figure 24).[73] Socioeconomic inequality is most evident in the areas north and east of the ZMVM, which have the highest number of people in poverty)773 In contrast, the central city has a higher number of services and jobs and a lower percentage of people in poverty)373\nCDMX has a shortage of green areas (e.g., urban forests, parks), which are important for the city and its inhabitants. Although international standards propose 96.8 to 172 square feet (sq ft) of green space per inhabitant, in CDMX there are 58.1 sq ft per inhabitant)33 Likewise, in marginalized areas access to public space and urban amenities is insufficient. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 107.6 to 161.4 sq ft of public space per inhabitant; but CDMX has only 55.9 sq ft per inhabitant)333\nto urban expansion into peripheral areas of the ZMVM. This growth pattern has created major challenges for mobility, as much of the population must travel long distances to access employment opportunities and other services.\nIn CDMX, most urban growth occurs in Conservation Areas, which puts pressure on the environmental services that these lands provide. In this context, SEDUVI is collaborating with SEDEMA to integrate protection policies for Conservation Areas into the new CDMX General Urban Development Program with the objective to align them with ecological planning principles.\nUrban renewal projects \u2014together with recovery, expansion, and creation of public space, green areas, urban amenities, and housing\u2014can contribute to reducing risks, increasing socio-spatial equality, and achieving proper resource management, especially for water. Urban and regional planning, design, and policies should consider the possible impacts of climate change and take into account the vulnerabilities associated with the conditions of underdevelopment and social marginalization of certain groups and communities in the city.\nIn CDMX, housing and employment are not balanced; this lack of balance has resulted in urban sprawl, which has led\n77.\tThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recommends a comprehensive approach that considers education, employment, culture, security, public services, and social cohesion.\n78.\tWorld Bank, 2013b.\n79.\tCOMEVAL, 2010.\n80.\tINEGI, 2014.\n81.\tSEDEMA, 2015.\n82.\tAEP. 2016.\nGOAL 3.1.\nIncrease spatial social equality in CDMX through programs and projects.\nACTION 3.11\nPreserve, expand, and recover green areas.\nIt is necessary to preserve, expand, and recover green areas within the city and promote investment in programs such as Green Roofs (Azoteas Verdes), the Urban Image Improvement Program (Programa de Mejora de Imagen Urbana), the Gullies Management Program (Programa de Manejo de Barrancas), and the Environmentally Valuable Areas Management Program (Programa de Manejo de las Areas de Valor Ambiental). These efforts may be supplemented with environmental education initiatives (such as those of the Center for Environmental Education) that can reinforce the importance of green infrastructure for the city.\nResponsible Parties: SEDEMA Partners: Cemex Period: 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThis action would help to reduce the deficit of green areas that exists in certain parts of the city. Realization of this goal would increase equality and social cohesion and provide ecosystem services that would improve the quality of life of city inhabitants.\nACTION 3.1.2.\nEnhance access to public space in working class and marginalized areas.\nPublic space is a strategic public good that drives the transformation of a city and improves the quality of life of the population. Building high-quality public space offers an opportunity to generate precedents for smart development, sustainability, and resilience practices and promotes access for the most vulnerable groups.\nResilience Value:\nInvestments in public space design can address multiple issues, including unequa access, economic development, and environmental pressures, and promote other benefits such as security and social cohesion.\nResponsible Parties: AEP Partners: BID, BM, CAF Period: 2016-2025\nACTION 3.1.3.\nExpand urban amenities to integrate resilience elements.\nA consolidated strategy is needed to increase access to high-quality urban amenities for health, education, sports, and culture, because those spaces promote social integration, common identity, and community well-being.\nTo implement a strategy for better urban infrastructure distribution and access, CDMX has carried out a number of projects, including the Neighborhood Improvement Program (Programa de Mejoramiento Barrial) and the Public Markets Improvement Program (Programa de Mejoramiento de Mercados Publicos). CDMX has also established the Central-East Strategic Management Area (Area de Gestion Estrategica Centro Oriente) as an action PPGDU project and a PGDU.\nIn addition, the General Urban Development Program (Programa General de Desarrollo Urbano) and District Programs (Programas Delegacionales) are an opportunity to establish guidelines for better distribution of and access to quality urban amenities in the city. Such guidelines allow for the creation of neighborhood improvement strategies that integrate\npublic space elements, green areas, and urban amenities.\nResponsible Parties: SEDUVI Period: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nThrough the design and construction of resilient and multifunctional urban amenities, CDMX can increase access to basic services; promote social cohesion; and increase the quality of health, education, sport, and cultural services.\nACTION 3.1.4.\nImprove access to affordable and public housing in areas with access to public transportation and sources of employment.\nUrban sprawl has led to the construction of housing facilities that are increasingly distant from services, employment opportunities, and public transportation. Optimization of social and public housing and the provision of new financing schemes are measures to transform the city by reducing marginalization in urban environments.\nCurrent housing programs that have been flagged as priorities are the Multi-Family Housing Program (Programa de Vivienda en Conjunto), the Housing Improvement Program (Programa de Mejoramiento a la Vivienda), and the Emergent Affordable Housing Program (Programa de Vivienda Emergente de Interes Social). The goals of these programs will be to create a more accessible city, develop social and public\nhousing that is connected to the existing transportation network (the STC Metro and Metrobus corridors and around the CETRAMs), and propose a common longterm agenda to promote such housing.\nResponsible Parties: INVI, SEDUVI Partners: BID, BM Period: 2016-2040\nResilience Value:\nHousing that is connected to the transportation network and the locations of employment contributes to economic and social development and improves accessibility to urban services and infrastructure as well as general mobility within the city.\nGOAL 3.2.\nProtect Conservation Areas.\nACTION 3.2.1.\n\u00ae Implement the Borde Activo initiative to control the expansion of the urban areas into Conservation Areas.\nThe Borde Activo (Active Edge) initiative is part of the PPGDU as an area where pilot projects for environmental restoration and urban area containment will be implemented. The Borde Activo initiative, also called Critical Areas of Occupation of Conservation Areas, which was developed by SEDEMA, is a rural-urban interface that will limit urban growth and protect ecosystems by creating a productive link between socioeconomics and the environment.\nResponsible Parties: SEDEMA Partners: TNC Period: 2016-2040\nResilience Value:\nThe Borde Activo initiative will help contro urban growth through land conservation. The initiative will help stem progressive changes in land use and landscape fragmentation and improve the natural assets available to the city.\nACTION 3.2.2.\nStrengthen protection of Conservation Areas.\nTo strengthen protection of Conservation Areas in CDMX and its surrounding jurisdictions within Conservation Areas, the following projects and programs will be implemented: Payment for Environmental Services (Pago por Servicios Ambientales), the Water Forest Initiative (Iniciativa Bosque de Agua), the Conservation Areas and Natural Protected Areas Inspection and Monitoring Program (Programa de Inspeccion y Vigilancia en Suelo de Conservacion y Areas Naturales Protegida), the Forest Fire Prevention and Fighting Program (Programa de Prevencion y Combate de Incendios Forestales), the Ecosystem Conservation and Restoration Founding Program (Programa de Fondos de Apoyo para la Conservacion y Restauracion de los Ecosistemas [PROFACE]), Forest Sanitation Program (Programa de Sanidad Forestal), and Water Found (Fondo de Agua) (see Action 2.2.1).\nResponsible Parties: SEDEMA Partners: TNC, Cl Period: 2016 - 2040\nResilience Value:\nThe implementation of this action would contribute to the preservation of the environmental services generated on Conservation Areas that are essential for maintaining the quality of life for CDMX inhabitants.\nGOAL 3.3.\nReduce risk through urban and regional planning.\nACTION 3.3.1.\nPromote institutional synergy and incorporate the principles of resilience at various levels of planning.\nUrban policies that incorporate the principles of resilience at different levels of planning should be created from the PPGDU and Partial and District Urban Development Programs (Programas Delegacionales y Parciales de Desarrollo Urbano) and, at federal level, links should be established with the POZMVM.\nEfforts at the institutional level to consolidate policies that focus on reducing various risks and stresses present in the city and the region must be approved and coordinated. One essential activity is the linking of information from the CDMX Atlas of Risks and Hazards (Atlas de Riesgos y Peligros) with different planning instruments to inform decision making at the city level.\nResponsible Parties: SEDUVI Period: 2016-2018\nResilience Value:\nConsideration of resilience principles in planning gives a comprehensive long-term vision and strengthens urban projects and policies related to risk reduction and longterm vulnerability management.\nACTION 3.3.2.\nInvest in areas and urban renewal projects that reduce risk and promote sustainable management of economic, environmental, and social resources.\nThis action will identify strategies that promote resilience through interventions at the urban level. SEDUVI develops projects for urban renewal in some areas of CDMX that are an opportunity to integrate resilience principles. These areas are classified in two planning instruments called Cooperation-based Performance Systems (Sistemas de Actuacion por Cooperacion [SAC]) and Strategic Management Areas (i.e., AGE).[S4] Both instruments will be used to achieve conformity of policies and specific projects to encourage environmental renewal and promote topics such as public space, urban amenities, sustainable mobility, green and blue infrastructure, and housing.\nUrban renewal projects can reduce risk and encourage responsible management of environmental resources.\nResponsible Parties: SEDUVI Partners: Rebuild by Design, Deltares, TNC, Fundacion ICA, Veolia\nPeriod: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nThe achievement of renewal and revitalization of urban areas through a comprehensive view is a mechanism to reduce risk and generate replicable strategies for proper management of natural resources. These revitalized areas have potential for innovation in socioeconomic and environmental development and integration of the community in that process.\n83.\tThe SAC include: Alameda Reforma (317 ha), La Mexicana (41 ha), Tacubaya (140 ha), Doctores - Buenos Aires (250 ha), Distrito San Pablo (100 ha), Atlampa (288 ha) and Granadas (367 ha).\n84.\tAmong AGE areas such as Xochimilco, Tlahuac y Milpa Alta. Heritage have been identified.\nACTION 3.3.3.\nImplement adaptation, mitigation, and resilience actions for communities and housing facilities in high-risk and marginalized areas.\nHousing facilities in risk areas should be identified for possible relocation, and those for which actions should be promoted to address the main impacts and stresses should be prioritized. Existing programs should also be expanded and strengthened to assist communities in high-risk areas (for example, the Gullies Improvement Program [Programa de Mejoramiento de Barrancas] and the Risk Areas Housing Improvement Program [Programa de Mejoramiento de Vivienda en Zonas de Riesgo]). Likewise, there are also pilot projects that incorporate the principles of resilience at the community level such as Safe Neighborhood (Barrio Seguro) and the Retrieving Life Spaces in the Santa Fe Gullies (Recuperando\nespacios para la vida en las barrancas de Santa Fe).\nResponsible Parties: SPC\nPartners: CEMEX, Fundacion Carlos Slim, IDB, Habitat para la Humanidad, UNAM, COLMEX, La Cuadra A.C.\nPeriod: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nThis action will reduce urban growth in high-risk areas and encourage measures that improve the living conditions of people in marginalized areas through enhancement of their environment and promotion of social cohesion.\nINSPIRATION FROM ROTTERDAM: CLIMATE RESILIENT DISTRICT.\nThe city of Rotterdam is implementing the project \"Climate Resilient District, ZOHO\u201d (ClimateProof ZOHO District), which integrates water management measures through public space improvements and interventions with physical structures affected by the environment. The project is part of the Rotterdam Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change and part of Rotterdam's Resilience Strategy. The ZOHO area is a strategic site because it incorporates replicable urban conditions and the potential key impacts of climate change such as floods, torrential rains, droughts, and heat waves.\nThe Climate Resilient District incorporates spaces that include adaptation and resilience measures in their design, such as the Water Plaza for water storage, restoration of water balance, and reduction of the effects of heat waves. The project includes the participation of key stakeholders, funding sources, and shared responsibilities for the maintenance of the spaces.\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nMobility is considered one of the main issues at a local and metropolitan level because of the impact it has on competitiveness, productivity, and the environment. In recent decades, major public investments were allocated for large infrastructure projects that encouraged the use of private transportation. Although only 30 percent of commutes are made by private car, 85 percent of the road space is used by this means of transportation. As a result, CDMX is one of the cities in the world with the highest number of traffic jams, which have a major impact on quality of life and public health.\nTraffic jams add to commute time and, therefore the city's productivity and competitiveness are affected; it is estimated that traffic generated losses of up to 33 billion pesos per year.[33] In addition, traffic has a strong impact on air quality. Recently, high pollution levels have made clear the need for a profound transformation in the regional public transportation system, for which comprehensive policies and large investments are required.\nAlthough 70 percent of daily trips are made by public transportation, service is exceeded by demand because, despite\nthe great efforts made in recent years, public transportation service is not yet homogeneously and equitable distributed.[39] To discourage the use of private cars, CDMX's public transportation system needs to offer commutes with high standards of quality, efficiency, and safety.\nAny traffic transformation requires the city to focus on sustainable models that benefit mobility. Currently, CDMX has made progress in that direction. One example is the CDMX New Mobility Model, which is based on 10 principles3333 that prioritize the most vulnerable users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Bicycle usage has increased as bicycles are increasingly recognized as an efficient means of transportation. Bicycles have an average travel speed of 10.19 miles per hour compared to the 9.3 miles per hour of cars,333 and they do not emit pollution.\nRoad safety for pedestrians and cyclists has become worrisome, as traffic accidents have become the leading cause of death for people between the ages of 5 and 3O.3333\nThere are no sidewalks on 2T3 percent of city roads, and 89 percent of the roads are not accessible for people with disabilities. Road safety is considered a priority for the integration of CDMX with the Vision Zero Strategy for CDMX,[93] which is already in place.\nUrban settings and their relationship to the location of jobs, services, and housing are other key issues for mobility.\nEfforts at a metropolitan level to generate a more compact and connected city need to be coordinated between those responsible for urban development and the mobility system.\nFinally, data availability and access to information are two of the barriers for developing integrated and innovative solutions for the city\u2019s mobility challenges. It is essential to integrate platforms and tools that can facilitate the use of data for decision making.\nGOAL 4.1.\nPromote an integrated mobility system that connects and revitalizes CDMX and ZMVM.\nACTION 4.1.1.\nImprove infrastructure to create an integrated, accessible public transportation system for CDMX and ZMVM that includes service for people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.\nThis action will promote the Integrated Transport System (ITS),[94] which is a key tool for transforming mobility. This action includes upgrading public transportation units, improving the connections between different modes of transportation through building better infrastructure, unifying service standards, integrating rates and payment, as well as consolidating public transportation systems under a single authority to strengthen institutional coordination. A ong-term vision for regulation and contro of the transportation system is needed\nResponsible Party: SEMOVI\nPartners: ITDP, CTS Embarq\nPeriod: 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThe ITS has the ability to transform mobility in CDMX and ZMVM, and to increase access to public transportation in response to the specific needs of different groups. Increasing access to public transportation will positively impact the city's competitiveness.\nACTION 4.12\nEstablish policies and pilot projects to promote transportation oriented urban development.\nTransit-oriented development (TOD) is a strategy to create dense neighborhoods with a mix of concentrated uses around mass public transportation.[95] This strategy creates a compact, dynamic, and equitable city with accessible environments for cyclists and pedestrians\u2014all connected to a public mass transportation network. CDMX is developing strategic projects, such as recovery and redesign for Intermodal Transfer Centers (CETRAM), and is integrating TOD strategies into the new Urban Development General Program (PGDU) for specific areas of the city, with a focus on the development of housing, services, urban amenities, and jobs related to public transportation.\nResponsible Party: SEMOVI-SEDUVI Partners: ITDP, CTS Embarq, RMS Period: 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThe TOD strategy will allow CDMX to create a more compact city, with more jobs and a greater housing density, and to reduce commute times and the use of private cars. This strategy will have a positive impact on the quality of life of everyone in CDMX.\nACTION 4.1.3.\nExpand and innovate the consolidated public transportation network.\nThe development of the public transportation network and improvements to the existing infrastructure must be accelerated at the metropolitan level to expand access and connectivity. This can be achieved by applying innovative technologies to public transportation systems, such as aerial public transportation, electric transportation, and other clean transportation technologies.\nResponsible Parties: SEMOVI Partners: ITDP, CTS Embarq, UNAM Period: 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThis action contributes to a transformation of the CDMX mobility system to achieve a new metropolitan vision of a public transportation network that is more reliable, enhances access, reduces traffic jams and air pollution, and results in a paradigm shift through public transportation system innovations.\nGOAL 4.2.\nDiscourage the use of private cars.\nACTION 4.2.1.\nPromote pedestrian, cyclist, and public transportation mobility over private transportation mobility.\nCurrently, in CDMX projects such as Ecoparq and Hoy no circula (one day without a car), programs are in place that aim to discourage car use and, in contrast, promote resilience building through public transportation-oriented, comprehensive urban development. In addition, the possibility of creating Ecozonas (ecological areas) in places like the Historical City Center is being explored. Implementing exclusive lanes for cars with more than three passengers and enforcing the law of Minimum vs. Maximum [99] in parking lots are also being considered.\nResponsible Parties: SEMOVI Partners: C40, Fundacion Carlos Slim, ITDP, CTS Embarq\nPeriod: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nBy modifying the hierarchy of mobility priorities, problems such as traffic jams and lack of access to public transportation are reduced, and improving the air and quality of life of CDMX inhabitants becomes possible.\n99. The growth of parking spaces in CDMX encourages greater use of cars, and urban space is wasted. Regulations demand a minimum number of parking spaces for all new buildings depending on the constructed surface for all land uses. There is a proposal to eliminate the requirement for a minimum number of parking spaces for new constructions and replace it with a maximum number (IMCO-ITDP, 2016).\nGOAL 4.3.\nCreate a safe and accessible city for pedestrians and cyclists.\nACTION 4.3.1.\nImplement the Vision Zero initiative.\nThe government of CDMX, with the support of the Vision Zero Coalition,[l00] the Swedish Embassy, and the Inter-Amercan Development Bank (BID), is implementing Vision Zero CDMX with the aim of deterring the loss of human lives caused by traffic accidents. This initiative includes five elements: 1) road safety strategy, 2) road users training, 3) infrastructure that saves lives, 4) justice, and 5) creation of a single traffic control information system, the Vision Zero data system. Implementing the Vision Zero initiative has accelerated the implementation of other initiatives, such as Programa Integral de Seguridad Vial (Integrated Road Safety Program), Pasos Seguros (Safe Steps), Red por la Seguridad Vial (Network for Road Safety), and the pilot program Llega seguro (Safe arrival) in 13 schools.\nResponsible Parties: SEMOVI Partners: BID, Coalicion Vision Cero Period: 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nThis goal of this initiative is to create a safer city for pedestrians and cyclists, to reduce the number of injuries and deaths caused by car accidents, and to encourage and support community participation in the development of a road etiquette.\n100. The Vision Zero Coalition is comprised of civil society organizations such as Bicitekas, Brujula que orienta al Norte, Bici Gourmet, Biciverde, CTS Embarq, Cenfes AC, Ciudadano Atropellado, ITDP, Comision de la Movilidad, Movilidad y Desarrollo Mexico, Mexico Previene, Peatonito, Reacciona por la Vida, Refleacciona, Rodadas Mx, RepuBikla, Tedea, and Transita Seguro. www.coalicionvisioncero.org.\nINSPIRATION: VISION ZERO NEW YORK CITY.\nIn 2014, the New York City Department of Transportation established the Vision Zero Strategy because, in the 10 years prior to 2014, nearly 1,500 pedestrians and 190 cyclists lost their lives due to traffic accidents, and 15,000 others were severely injured.\nThe Vision Zero Strategy focuses on three main points: 1) any death or injury on the streets is unacceptable; 2) deaths and injuries caused by traffic accidents are preventable; 3) safe behavior should be expected of all citizens, and everyone must participate in cultural change. Specifically, the strategy focuses on making the streets safer through public dialogue and education, law enforcement, street design, and legislation. Citizens collaborated on the creation of each of these elements.\nBetween 2014 and 2015, fatalities related to traffic accidents dropped to 252, the lowest number ever reported in New York City's history. Moreover, since the first year of its implementation, the program has transformed the city's streets, increasing their safety and accessibility.\nWith respect to legislation, the speed limit was reduced to 24.8 miles per hour, and about 20,000 traffic monitoring units were installed. Eighty safe corridors and intersections have been completed, and 60 of them are located in priority sites. Furthermore, the redesign of four main corridors with the highest rates of traffic accidents has begun.\nUnder the Vision Zero Strategy, New York City will implement 50 projects each year to promote safety on the city's streets. An example is a project at Hunts Point Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, an intersection where high rates of car crashes have been reported. Safety interventions such as islands, crosswalks, and extensions for sidewalks and medians were installed. Other streets where successful interventions were implemented are Queen's Boulevard, Capital Concourse, Atlantic Avenue and 4th Avenue.\nACTION 4.3.2.\nTransform public space to promote active mobility.\nActive mobility refers to non-motorized commuting by pedestrians and cyclists. Transformation of public space through the construction of models of Complete Streets should consider the inclusion of urban infrastructure for active mobility. Communication strategies must be integrated if the public is to be aware of and understand the health and economic benefits of active mobility.\nResponsible Parties: SEDEMA Partners: ITDP, CTS Embarq Period: 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nActive mobility has many positive impacts, such as: health benefits, public space improvements, a reduction in car use, and decreases in vehicular pollution and traffic congestion.\nGOAL 4.4.\nPrepare the mobility system for the potential risks and effects of climate change.\nACTION 4.4.1.\nAdapt the public transportation system to the effects of climate change.\nIt is essential to ensure that the mobility system has the ability to withstand disruptive or unexpected events and adapt to changing conditions. Transportation systems are constantly exposed to events, such as floods, which could occur more frequently in the future. The mobility planning in this area must be strengthened to reduce recovery costs in case of an event and to enhance the effectiveness of the public transportation system.\nResponsible Parties: SEMOVI, SEDEMA Partners: ITDP, CTS Embarq, RMS Period: 2016 - 2018\nResilience Value:\nMaking adjustments to the city's mass public transportation network before effects associated with climate change occur (e.g., intense flooding, heat waves) helps avoid damaging impacts to the network's operation and reduces risks to\nusers.\nACTION 4.4.2.\nImprove mobility planning for emergency and disaster situations.\nBecause the city is exposed to earthquake hazards and other potential disasters, there are mitigation measurements and response protocols for each of the different transportation systems. However, a comprehensive strategy is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the city during emergencies and to improve communications and connections with safety areas and emergency responders. Currently, the Ministry of Civil Protection (SPC) is working on developing cooperative agreements for free transit on urban highways during an emergency, accident, or disaster, and for proposing signaling and disseminating entry and evacuation routes to the drivers of emergency and support vehicles.\nResponsible Parties: SEMOVI, SPC Partners: CTS Embarq, ITDP, RMS.Veolia Period: 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nBy consolidating CDMX mobility network response protocols and mitigation measures for emergency and disaster situations, system recovery costs may be reduced, negative effects on public transportation users can possibly be prevented, and the continuity of a critical city service is ensured.\nGOAL 4.5.\nPromote the use of data to improve mobility decision making.\nACTION 4.5.1.\nPromote public-private partnerships to encourage mobility data use.\nCDMX generates an enormous amount of data daily; however, not all of that data is available to the public. There are private companies with critical data and information that could be used to expand understanding of mobility patterns, which could, in turn, inform transportation mobility planning and decision making. Access to information has multiple benefits for different sectors. There is a potential opportunity to establish public-private partnerships that can strengthen access, collection, distribution, and use of information.\nThe Laboratory for the City (LabCDMX) and other organizations implemented the Mapaton program, which is an unprecedented collective effort based on users collaborating in the creation of open mobility databases.\nResponsible Parties: SEMOVI Partners: Audi Urban Future Initiative, a911, CTS Embarq, C40, ITDP, TomTom Period: 2016 - 2025\nResilience Value:\nData usage through data exchange platforms, data management, and the creation of digital tools can improve the decision making involved in the creation of effective public policies that are crucial to successful development of a more reliable mobility system.\nINSPIRATION: URBAN TRANSFORMATION - METROCABLE MEDELLIN\nMetrocable is an aerial public transportation system in Medellin. The system consists of several interconnected lines that supplement the subway lines. This project has a social element, as it focuses on improving the living conditions of low-income users living in the most deprived and unsafe areas of the city through urban design strategies that promote accessibility to transportation, public space, and urban amenities.\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nCDMX faces a variety of dynamic risks that may bring about human and economic losses. These risks may also result in impacts on the provision of basic services or reduce quality of life. The adaptive capacity of society, institutions, and strategic infrastructure must therefore be strengthened.\nThe concept of adaptation refers to measures and adjustments in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected stimuli, or their effects, in order to moderate damage and exploit any beneficial opportunities.[l02] The scientific community has recognized that adaptive challenges cannot be addressed through traditional responses, but require a constant process of learning, evaluation, and change.[l03]\nCities are recognized as centers of innovation that can generate transformations in their relationships and interactions with social-ecological systems. Cities, as centers of innovation, are ideally positioned to build a sustainable future,[l04] since innovation is essential for adaptation of the strategic infrastructure upon which the provision of basic urban services depends\nRisk assessment for strategic infrastructure can be a valuable tool for making decisions about risk reduction and transfer. Additionally, large infrastructure projects such as the NAICM offer a valuable opportunity for the development of the city and the region. Investments linked to these projects should be strengthened by incorporating the principles of resilience (Figure 19) from initial construction through all stages of design.\nThe intensification of the disaster risks associated with climate change and other dynamic processes is a challenge for the public and private sectors. Their capacity to address these risks may be exceeded, forcing them to turn to externa support. To address this challenge, the government of CDMX created the Fund for Assistance with Natural Disasters in Mexico City (FONADEN) in 2015, with an initial budget of 3 billion pesos (USD $162 million). The city is the first in the country to have a fund of this type, 30 percent of which is intended to address disasters such as earthquakes and floods. The private sector is also participating through strategic partnerships with the city, which can improve overall response and reduce losses. Innovative, inclusive, and flexible solutions are required, such as risk transfer instruments that allow early recovery, continuity of operations, independence of public support, and improved reconstruction.\nIt is essential to promote the adaptive capacities of citizens, which will enable them to respond in an organized way in the event of emergencies and which will strengthen social cohesion and responsibility at the community level, reduce domestic risks, and scale up resilience. The implementation of public policies for disaster relief should concentrate on the most vulnerable groups, as these policies will generate improvements in quality of life regardless of the risks to which these groups are exposed.\n102.\tThis definition of adaptation is presented in the General Law on Climate Change (Official Gazette of the Federation (DOF), 2012a), which refers to climatic stimuli; however, it has been modified to include other possible stimuli.\n103.\tBrooks and Adger, 2005; Hallegatte, 2009; Birkmann et al., 2010; Moser, 2010.\n104.\tCalvente, 2007; Olsson et al., 2014; Redman, 2014.\nIn the development of this strategy, in some cases existing regulations may need to be reviewed to facilitate the promotion of adaptive measures by government and society.\nFor public resources to be able to contribute to building resilience, potential barriers need to be identified and alternatives found.\nGOAL 5.1.\nIntegrate the principles of resilience in public facilities, investments, and new strategic projects, and promote private-sector participation in building resilience.\nACTION 5.1.1.\nFoster innovation for integrated risk management.\nThis action seeks to strengthen the integrated risk management in CDMX through innovative mechanisms for assessment, reduction, and risk transfer by which participation is encouraged in various sectors, both public and private.\nResponsible Parties: SEFIN, SEDECO Partners: BM, SwissRe, RMS, Veolia Period: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nBy expanding the options for sharing risks and strengthening the culture of insurance, it is possible to reduce the economic impact of disasters to which the city is exposed, and ensure continuity of activities that support the financial wellbeing of families.\nACTION 5.1.2.\nDevelop methodologies for the inclusion of the concept of resilience in large infrastructure projects, and propose adaptive measures to various risks for strategic provisioning of public facilities.\nThe concept of resilience is new, even within the decision-making process. This action is therefore aimed at influencing construction projects in the operation and improvement of strategic infrastructure and public urban facilities so that these projects incorporate resilience qualities, recognize the risks to which they are exposed, improve the effectiveness of adaptive measures, and better prioritize investments.\nResponsible : OR\nPartners: 100RC, RMS, PwC, CEMEX Period: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nThis action helps promote a multifunctiona information infrastructure that can reduce risks to the population, ensure continuity of basic services, and improve the environment and quality of life of the inhabitants of CDMX.\nRISK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS INC:\nPreliminary results of seismic risk analysis for public markets in CDMX.\nA sophisticated approach to measuring extreme risk is necessary to increase the resilience of the city's strategic public facilities. That measurement is complicated because disasters can occur unexpectedly and can vary in duration and intensity.\nProbabilistic models of loss due to a catastrophe can be applied when a disaster occurs. Based on a simulation of about 100,000 projections for the following year, which results in an estimate of the severity of potential losses based on a series of probabilities, these models can be used to quantify the current resilience of the city and to set a realistic goal for resilience in the future.\nVarious sectors of the CDMX government are working with RMS on evaluating the possible impacts on strategic public facilities in the event of a major earthquake. The preliminary analysis shown here, which characterizes the resilience of the network of nearly 300 public markets in the event of a major earthquake, is an example of the results that can be obtained from this effort.\nThe exceedance probability curve shows that a seismic event, such as the one that occurred in 1985, is not the worst-possible scenario for the city. Actually, there is a 1 percent chance that markets will suffer losses five times greater than those that were modeled for the 1985 earthquake, and a still substantial likelihood that the losses will be even ten times higher. This\nanalytical approach also provides an opportunity to identify where investments in resilience can be more productive; for example, considering the profile of resilience from multiple perspectives only, four markets have been highlighted, as shown in Figure 24.\nFurthermore, this analysis, performed with limited information on exposure, demonstrates the importance of having high-quality data on public and private property in the city. Intelligent assumptions can be derived from models, but the more complete and accurate the exposure data, the more accurate the results. From the modeling of resilience, the cost-benefit of investments in resilience for individual markets can be identified, and the modeling can also facilitate a holistic vision of the recovery capacity that includes other dangers, such as terrorism, infectious diseases, and drought.\nThis approach can be used to analyze other sections of critical infrastructure in the city, such as the network of modal transfer centers (CETRAMs) and roads, and to discover and quantify the complex interdependencies between the city assets and the risks that they face.\nFigure 26. Risks in CDMX markets (RMS)\nThe map indicates the location of public markets in CDMX, and the diameter of each circle represents the risk of each according to PAE. The exceedance probability curve shows that there is a 1 percent chance that the damages caused by an earthquake in the markets will be five times greater than the damages in 1985. In the lower box, the epicenter of stochastic earthquakes identified in the curve for the chosen probabilities is shown (1\/100 and 1\/500). Finally, the table shows the variations in damages undergone by the markets with three different earthquakes and according to the PAE.\nACTION 5.1.3.\nPromote private-sector participation in building urban resilience.\nThe government response to disasters or emergencies is strengthened by the participation of the private sector in the response. Collaboration with the private sector expands government capabilities and enhances disaster recovery. The purpose of this action is to identify economic activities that may be affected by a disaster and to share responsibility with the private sector for the decisionmaking process on issues of risk prevention and reduction, performance during emergencies, and reconstruction improvements.\nResponsible Parties: SPC, OR Partners: CENACED, CEMEX Period: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nPrivate sector involvement in the various stages of planning in the event of a disaster (prevention, preparedness, recovery, and reconstruction) improves the response by government, reduces disaster impacts, and accelerates recovery.\nGOAL 5.2.\nPromote community resilience through citizen participation, strategic communication, and education.\nACTION 5.2.1.\nCreate a communication platform for risk and resilience for citizens.\nThe aim is to create a platform that facilitates communication of risk information to the public and that allows community networks for the construction of urban resilience and adaptive capacities.\nResponsible Parties: SPC, OR Partners: City Heroes, Fundacion Carlos Slim, RMS\nPeriod: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nThis action provides information in a timely and adequate manner to help the public address risks, increase their adaptive capacity at the community level, guide their actions in emergency situations, and increase social cohesion, citizen participation and empowerment through risk awareness.\n105.\tThe disaster risk reduction was promoted internationally from the \"International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction\u201d in the 1990s, culminating in the Hyogo Framework for Action: Increased resilience of nations and communities in the event of disasters, approved at the \"World Conference on Disaster Reduction\" in 2005. One of the objectives of this document was to increase the availability of adequate and reliable information on disasters, not only for decision makers, but for the general population (UN, 2005).\n106.\tUN 2015b.\n107.\tUN 2015b.\n108.\tThe Rockefeller Foundation, 2014.\n109.\tAmong the 25 cities recognized as the most competitive in promoting data sharing on disaster risks are New York, London, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, San Francisco, and Melbourne (The Economist, 2013).\n110.\tNeighborhood Empowerment Network at: http:\/\/empowersf.org\nACTION 5.2.2.\nStrengthen the technical capacity of civil servants to build resilience.\nResilience depends largely on the ability of people to be prepared, transform themselves, respond, and survive in the face of destructive events that can occur in the place where they live.\nThis is particularly important for civil servants, who are responsible for meeting the needs of others during emergencies, so it is necessary to strengthen their capacities.\nResponsible Parties: EAP y OR Period: 2016-2018\nResilience Value:\nBuilding the response capacities of civil servants helps them make critical decisions in emergency situations and prioritize assistance to the population. This knowledge also helps civil servants to create long-term public policies that increase the security of citizens.\nACTION 5.2.3.\nEncourage citizen participation resilience issues.\nThis action consists of implementing communication campaigns on topics that contribute to building the city's resilience, so that citizens become aware of the actions that are being carried out and which they can join, and inviting them to actively participate in the resilience building effort. Initially, the issues to be promoted based on their importance in building resilience are: Vision Zero, water poverty, and protection and care of green\nareas.\nand communication of priority\nResponsible Parties: SEDEMA, OR Partners: 100RC, Pacifico, Banamex, Fundacion Carlos Slim, MakeSense, CENACED\nPeriod: 2016-2018.\nResilience Value:\nClear and accurate communication on key resilience issues provides citizens with reliable information to make better decisions, encourages citizen participation, and promotes action and leadership.\nINSPIRATION: REBUILD BY DESIGN - WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD A\nMORE RESILIENT REGION.\nRebuild by Design (RBD) can collaborate with CDMX in the introduction of a collaborative design process for planning and specific problem solving\u2014a process that contributes to improving urban and regional resilience. RBD emerged from the call for a design contest for the reconstruction of areas affected by Hurricane Sandy in New York, and has evolved into the promoter of an innovative process that generates practical solutions to complex problems.\nThe purpose is not only to invite sectors that were usually excluded from urban planning solutions, but to place them in the middle of a solid, interdisciplinary, and creative design process that generates innovative responses.\nThe RBD process is carried out in a series of successive and connected stages that are established to maintain cross collaboration among sectors, academic strength, and a mobile design and that result in an easily replicable process. Based on the success of this methodology in the city of New York, RBD's goal has been to establish it as a model for designing resilience solutions to problems in other cities.\nThis methodology has been considered a paradigm shift in the way governments and those responsible for urban planning consider emergency preparedness and disaster response. RBD relies on collaboration among designers, researchers, community members, and government officials in a process that proposes solutions to problems, solutions that take into account physical, social, and ecological factors.\nIn addition to increasing risk awareness in society, RBD has an important connection to the community during the implementation process and explores the need for changes in policies and regulatory structure to improve resilience building.\nACTION 5.2.4.\nDevelop initiatives focused on vulnerable groups.\nSome social groups are more vulnerable to disaster events than the average population due to conditions that may be permanent or dynamic. These factors contribute to vulnerability: age (dependent children, older adults who need special help in emergencies), gender, economic conditions (poverty, unemployment, homelessness), location (ravines, dry stream beds), and social situation (lack of social cohesion, exclusion), among others. Initiatives that reduce the vulnerability stemming from these factors should be developed.\nResponsible Parties: OR\nPartners: Save the Children, UNESCO, UNISDR, Fundacion Centro Historico, Make Sense, SEDEREC, FAO, OXFAM Period: 2016-2025\nResilience Value:\nAddressing these specific vulnerabilities generates multiple benefits because doing so not only builds urban resilience, but also helps create a sense of community, reduces social inequality, and improves everyone's quality of life.\nINSPIRATION: RIO DE JANEIRO STRATEGY: FEATURED ACTION -\nEDUCATE CHILDREN FOR RESILIENCE.\nIn the Rio de Janeiro Strategy for Resilience, the action of educating children for resilience is highlighted. The project seeks to develop and implement urban resilience topics to complement civil protection concepts in the curriculum of the municipal schools. Resilience topics were recently included in an educationa program that is currently benefitting around 5,000 children aged 10 to 12 years. It is estimated that this complementary project will benefit 100,000 students by 2020.\nContent is included on the following three topics:\n\u2022\tImpact of climate change on cities and how it affects the lives of young people.\n\u2022\tBasic civil protection concepts and disaster preparedness.\n\u2022\tSustainable consumption and resource efficiency, particularly regarding energy and water; introduction of recycling fundamentals and the processing of materials and products.\nThe project believes that children should become aware of the risks they are exposed to in their neighborhood and city, and should develop resilient behaviors in their youth. This project will create awareness and promote a culture of risk prevention and mitigation, and it will also foster environmental and civic responsibility.\nGOAL 5.3.\nReview and adjust the regulatory framework to promote the implementation of adaptative measures.\nACTION 5.3.1\nAssess the contribution of relevant local programs and projects for resilience within the expenditures budget of the CDMX government (10 percent commitment).\nAs mentioned in Chapter III of this document, in November 2015, the CDMX government committed to allocate 10 percent of the expenditures budget to building resilience. This action fulfills the commitment to pursue investments in resilience that are transformative. The actions of all government institutions that contribute to the resilience of the city must be acknowledged, and programs and projects that make resilience investments safer, inclusive, and sustainable must also be promoted.\nResponsible Party: OR\nPeriod: 2016-2018\nResilience Value:\nThis action allows for the prioritization of CDMX actions in the budget, which will help reduce tensions among the proponents of different programs and projects and enable the city to be better prepared to deal with potential impacts.\nACTION 5.3.2.\nPropose a measuring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system that promotes continuous learning and adjustment of actions.\nThe aim is to include the MRV System for the Resilience Strategy within the framework of the PACCM. The MRV assesses the progress made in the fulfillment of the PACCM's goals and objectives, and monitors the development of the city's mitigation and adaptation actions. Suitable criteria and indicators for the actions that make up this strategy, developed by both the public and private sectors, civil society, and the scientific community, should be integrated into the MRV System.\nResponsible Parties: OR\nPeriod: 2016-2018\nResilience Value:\nThis action validates the actions that underpin the resilience strategy of CDMX, promotes continuous learning, and guides the necessary process of making changes and updating actions.\nVI\nNEXT\nSTEPS\nVI. NEXT STEPS\nAfter adoption of the CDMX Resilience Strategy by the Resilience Steering Committee (Comite Directivo de Resiliencia) of the CICCDF, the implementation stage will begin. This stage will be an inclusive process; stakeholders from government, the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the scientific community will participate as responsible parties and partners in specific activities within the framework of the five pillars for creating resilience in the CDMX and the region.\nThe path toward the creation of resilience is a process that involves continuous learning to address the multiple risks that the city is exposed to in a dynamic environment. The creation of an MRV system will be a key element in establishing periodic evaluations and facilitating continuous learning, because the MRV system will be linked to the Monitoring of the CDMX Climate Change Action Program (SSPACCM). Inclusion of NGOs in implementation actions and the MRV system would be innovative and address the need to share responsibilities.\nBuilding resilience is a process that uses long-term planning and implementation actions to meet the Resilience Strategy goals. The Resilience Office for CDMX will pursue the following objectives:\n\u2022\tCoordinate transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary work for designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the Resilience Strategy goals and actions.\n\u2022\tProvide innovative solutions to existing and potential resilience challenges in the city and the region.\n\u2022\tIdentify and promote the implementation of global best practices for resilience in the city.\n\u2022\tProvide technical assistance and collaboration to 100RC partners.\n\u2022\tPromote the incorporation of the principles of resilience in public planning and actions at different levels of government (boroughs, city, and the region).\n\u2022\tPromote regional coordination and create collaborative mechanisms between different levels of government on critical resilience issues.\n\u2022\tPromote agreements between stakeholders from different sectors and public-private collaborations to reduce chronic stresses and improve responsiveness to shocks.\n\u2022\tPromote citizen communication, education, and participation campaigns to build and strengthen resilience in society.\n\u2022\tMonitor the Government of Mexico City\u2019s on its commitment to allocate 10 percent of public expenditures to actions that contribute to resilience improvements.\nResilience will be built in the city through joint efforts; thus, continued support from the institutions and organizations that have been identified so far will be essential. In addition, the Resilience Strategy is a living process that will continue to identify new resilience opportunities and stakeholders interested in and committed to joining this collective and inclusive effort to create a resilient CDMX and region.\nVII\nAPPENDIX","ENTITIES":{"PERSON":["Fundacion Centro Historico","MICHAEL BERKOWITZ","Adger","Fundacion Kaluz","Doctores","Ciudadano Atropellado","Eric Garcetti","Miguel Angel Mancera","Megalopolis","Mancera","TANYA MULLER GARCIA","Brooks","Tanya Muller Garcia","Flavia Tudela","Olsson","Redman","Mario Molina","Daniela Torres","Jerry Brown","A.

The tiny settlement of 'Rotta' at the Rotte river bank has, over the course of centuries, grown into the major city of today. Rotterdam has its citizens to thank for that, from the early settlers to the current residents. The people of Rotterdam utilized the city's location and its potential to the fullest, turning the water of the Rotterdam delta from its biggest threat into its greatest opportunity. They seized opportunities presented by trade and fishery. They embraced plans by visionaries such as Pieter Caland, whose 'Nieuwe Waterweg' (New Waterway) established the city's direct connection to the North Sea.\nRotterdam's history is marked by its residents' resilience. Challenges were overcome, in water management, trade, fighting cholera epidemics, and in literally reconstructing the city after a devastating bombardment at the start of the Second World War left much of the city in ruins. Rotterdam has always faced difficult situations by looking to the future and finding opportunities for city improvement; 'stronger through struggle' is our motto.\nIn May 2013 I met Judith Rodin, the Rockefeller Foundation's CEO, in New York City. The great importance of resilience, in relation to the economic structure and livability of cities was recognized by her organization. Global developments, such as urbanization, climate change and the increasing complexity of urban society tell us we must look ahead and be prepared. The 100 Resilient Cities initiative was born.\nShe encouraged me to join the cities at the forefront, exploring the meaning of resilience for Rotterdam, and discovering the ways in which we can continue to build on our historical accomplishments. I embraced the\ninvitation with conviction. Rotterdam has always shown resilience, but innovative cities remain successful by being future-driven, rather than coasting on past successes.\nThe people of Rotterdam are the key to the resiliency of their city. Their agility and resilience are crucial when disaster strikes. The memories of Paris and Brussels are still fresh. Continuing work on an inclusive Rotterdam society will further increase its resilience and provide balance. Developments in technology and society continue to challenge our resilience as well. The knowledge and skills necessary to deal with these new challenges are essential in order to keep moving ahead. The urgency of resilience is displayed in many areas.\nAn example that stresses the urgency, in my opinion, is the growth, interconnectivity of and dependencies on ICT systems. This calls for 'cyber resilience': the ability of Rotterdam's city and port area to keep functioning, despite disruptions that will surely occur.\nI am very proud to present to you Rotterdam's resilience strategy. This is only the beginning, not a blueprint.\nThe strategy provides a new way of thinking, with new insights on how to further expand Rotterdam's robustness, flexibility and inclusivity.\nI invite you to view your daily activities and your passions through the 'resilience lens' this strategy offers. How do your activities contribute to Rotterdam's resilience? Share your views and experiences with us as city officials, with your colleagues and your fellow-citizens. For only by joining forces, can we make our city even stronger and more beautiful.\nAHMED ABOUTALEB\nMAYOR OF ROTTERDAM\nLETTER FROM MICHAEL BERKOWITZ\nThe release of Rotterdam's first-ever comprehensive Resilience Strategy is an evolutionary step forward for a city with a rich history of innovation and leadership. From its recovery after the destruction of World War II, to its globally recognized work on climate adaptation and water management, Rotterdam has time and again shown that it never shies away from confronting the most pressing challenges of the day head-on. The release of this strategy builds on this storied legacy.\nThrough this strategy, Rotterdam is taking an honest and proactive view of its resilience challenges and opportunities, while laying the groundwork for important work ahead. It recognizes that Rotterdam must become resilient not just by fortifying its defences to a changing climate and rising seas, but also by building a more cohesive and inclusive society. This is especially evident in the strategy's cross-cutting initiatives, which focus on finding multi-benefit solutions to\nclimate, technological, and socio-economic risks that can achieve a resilience dividend for the city.\nRotterdam has moved well beyond climate adaptation expertise to be at the cutting-edge of resilience topics such as building cyber resilience, and upgrading the landmark Peperklip Building. Specifically, renovations such as the Peperklip's should provide an opportunity to establish a link between the municipality of Rotterdam, to jobs and social cohesion programs for its residents.\nIf completed under current plans, the project has the potential to house one of Europe's largest roof gardens.\nOf course, none of this could have been possible without the strong support and vision of Mayor Aboutaleb. As one of the first members of 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, Mayor Aboutaleb established Rotterdam as a leader in our global network early in our engagement. His keen interest in our partnership catalyzed the energy and political will necessary to turn Rotterdam's challenges into opportunities. A special thanks should also be extended to Rotterdam's CRO, Arnoud Molenaar, who hosted 1 00 Resilient Cities' first ever Network Exchange and led an extensive process of research, analysis, and stakeholder engagement over the past few years that resulted in the fantastic work we see today.\nThough this strategy represents the end of the strategic planning process in Rotterdam, it is only the beginning of the exciting work to come in the months and years ahead. And 1 00 Resilient Cities' partnership with the City of Rotterdam is also just beginning. It is now that we can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively impact the lives of all of those who call Rotterdam home. From its willingness to engage with world-class service providers through the 1 00 Resilient Cities platform of partners like Microsoft, to its ability to export best practices across the globe, Rotterdam is well positioned to continue leading the global urban resilience revolution. We at 1 00 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these efforts.\nBEST REGARDS,\nMICHAEL BERKOWITZ\nPRESIDENT, 100 RESILIENT CITIES - PIONEERED BY THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION\nLETTER FROM ARNOUD MOLENAAR\nVery few 'Rotterdammers' (citizens of Rotterdam) know, but Rotterdam is world-renowned for its adaptation to climate change. International delegations visit the city every week, to see for themselves how we handle management of dykes and levees, water management, rain and use of ground- and drinking water. Their tours include visits to our water squares, underground parking garages with a built-in water storage facilities and a rowing course that doubles as a water buffer, combining sports, recreation and water management. They may also stop to look at multifunctional dykes, experimental floating constructions or the internet system that allows us to monitor the entire city's groundwater levels.\nRotterdam's leading position in climate adaptation helped local businesses to receive millions of dollars in commissions in the aftermath of the disastrous hurricanes Katrina in New Orleans and Sandy in New York. Rotterdam may proudly state: we make cities climate proof.\nThe climate change adaptation program we have been working on for more than a decade, is a good example of how to sustainably handle risks and threats. Of course, we have a long history of Dutch craftsmanship to build upon. Our approach is to keep threats at bay, even using them to Rotterdam's advantage, increasing quality of life in our city and efficiency in our port. We do so because it is essential that the continuity of our city is preserved. Our efforts on climate change adaptation were a reason for the Rockefeller Foundation to invite us to join their resilience challenge, so that we could share our experiences, expand our horizons and learn from other cities - on climate change, and all the other challenges facing cities today.\nThis document is Rotterdam's first Resilience Strategy.\nOur primary goal is to make resilience-thinking common practice in our city and part of our DNA. We do so for you and with you. Six themes and a wide range of inspiring initiatives, both new and operational, will help increase our city's resilience.\n100 Resilient Cities helped us in our journey to develop this Resilience Strategy and we are very grateful for this support. Participation in the 100 Resilient Cities Network has further strengthened and expanded Rotterdam's image as a well-prepared, innovative delta city. We look\nFrom the laying of the first foundations of the city, the spirit of resilience has been engrained in our psyche. Instead of fighting the water, we used it to our advantage, creating land, establishing a new waterway (Nieuwe Waterweg) and promoting our city and World-class port as the main gateway to Europe. Our city and our people have - throughout history - overcome numerous shocks and stresses. We have adopted the city motto \"Stronger through struggle\" (\"Sterker door strijd\") - this was added to our coat of arms to remember the courage and the strength shown by the people of Rotterdam through World War II. Our city centre was destroyed during World War II, but we have recovered, and in 2015 our city was voted the best city centre in the Netherlands. Rotterdam is now a thriving cosmopolitan city, with a wealth of cultures and ethnicities. Our citizens are among the happiest in the Netherlands. It is well known for its modern architecture and has a vibrant cultural scene with an eclectic variety of shops, attractions, festivals, restaurants and parks. It is home to Europe's largest and one of the top ten most important ports in the world and from this naval and industrial heritage it is now emerging as an exciting and dynamic entrepreneurial hub. It is well served by top quality internationally renowned knowledge institutions and universities which help to ensure we have a highly skilled and agile workforce.\nBut as we reflect on our past, we also foresee new risks and challenges in the future from, for example; digitization, climate change, the new economy and globalization. We know that we cannot become complacent and that these challenges need to be faced. We have a reputation for designing and engineering robust systems but we acknowledge that future risks might call for a different response - more flexibility and greater inclusiveness - perhaps different governance and funding approaches. Ensuring Rotterdam's ongoing resilience will be a challenge, but it's one we are ready for. We know that the technological and societal changes of the 21st century will present new risks and opportunities but we want to fight for a sustainable, safe, united and healthy future for our city.\n\"READY FOR THE 21st CENTURY\"\nRESILIENCE IS MORE THAN CLIMATE ADAPTATION.\nCities and urban environments are becoming increasingly more diverse, dynamic, connected and as such can be unpredictable. Resilient cities have in place the governance, social and financial infrastructure to\nINCREASING DYNAMICS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS\nadequately respond to these sometime unpredictable changes - to recover quickly and to bounce back to become stronger than before. Rotterdam, as a Delta city, contains a vast and successful port and industrial complex, is home to a diverse and growing population and is situated in one of the most open economies in the world. It is therefore exposed to - and needs to be ready to respond to - a number of important global, regional and local transitions.\nIn the last 10 years Rotterdam has won international acclaim for its work on climate adaptation. Our water squares, underground car parks with huge rain retention basins, multifunctional dykes and floating constructions are often profiled in international press and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and Hurricane Sandy in New York this experience has attracted millions of dollars of revenue for Rotterdam based companies. Our companies have a strong reputation for helping to climate proof cities!\nWe're proud of our track record on managing water and climate risks but we recognize this is only one of the stresses that our city is facing. Over the last two years, with the support of 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, we have expanded our view of what city resilience means. We have begun to think of resilience in a much more holistic way, considering a broader range of shocks and stresses.\nIn developing our resilience strategy we've used the methodology and many of the tools developed by 100 Resilient Cities, we've engaged with hundreds of local stakeholders, spoken to international specialists, held workshops, conducted research and worked hard to zero in on the areas that we believe require the most attention to take Rotterdam's resilience to the next level. We've articulated our resilience challenge, developed a single integrated vision for a Resilient Rotterdam in 2030, defined seven resilience goals and determined\n68 actions that we will work to take forward in the coming years. We would like to thank 100 Resilient Cities and all the contributors and supporters that have helped us to develop this document - Rotterdam's first official Resilience Strategy. This is only the start; we still have a lot of work and further exploration to do, and we will need the engagement and collaboration from numerous city stakeholders to deliver on this vision.\n\"CITIES THAT HAVE CONSIDERED THEIR RESILIENCE IN A HOLISTIC WAY WILL BE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE.\"\n100\nRESILIENT\nCITIES.\nin the 100 Resilient Cities programme has helped to strengthen our growing reputation as a hub for clean tech and as a city taking action on climate change and has allowed us to cement important partnerships within the city and internationally. It has also supported us in helping to promote and export the skills and services of some of our local private sector partners (e.g. private sector companies such as Deltares, Arcadis and TNO are now active in Denmark, India and the US).\n100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100 Resilient Cities supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks (i.e. earthquakes, fires, floods) but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis, www.100resilientcities.org.\nThe programme was established in honour of Rockefeller's 100th anniversary; it will ultimately involve 100 cities globally and had initial funding of $100 million although the level of funding support has grown since the programme was launched.\nRotterdam, like other cities in the network, has received support from 100 Resilient Cities in a range or ways, as follows;\n\u2022\tFinancial and logistical support to the position of a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO)\n\u2022\tExpertise in guiding the process to develop a robust resilience strategy - Rotterdam has benefited from input from AECOM as a 100 Resilient Cities strategy partner, as well as advice and guidance from 100 Resilient Cities staff and other network cities\n\u2022\tAccess to solutions, service providers and public and private partners and NGOs - Rotterdam has had additional support from Microsoft, TNO and Drift\n\u2022\tMembership of a network of world cities for knowledge exchange and learning - as an example Rotterdam hosted a successful network exchange in 2015 attended by around twenty other CRO's.\nWe are proud to have been one of the front running cities in the 100 Resilient Cities network and are pleased with the interactions we've already experienced through the network. Already it has been a catalyst for our participation in new resilience projects and has helped to enhance our city brand and identity. Our participation\n16 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nRotterdam has recently signed the 100 Resilient Cities 10% pledge; committing 10% of the municipality annual budget towards spending on resilience projects and initiatives. This commitment means we are eligible for up to $5 million (additional) in platform resources through our association with 100 Resilient Cities. We will draw on this support to support implementation of strategy.\nWHAT IS RESILIENCE.\nMORE THAN ROBUSTNESS.\nThe 100 Resilient Cities programme defines urban resilience as: \"The capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience\".\nIn developing our resilience strategy we drew heavily on the 100 Resilient Cities established methodology\nand supporting tools. The City Resilience Framework (CRF) helped us to identify the relevant domains of city resilience. Our stage 2 diagnostic tasks helped us to identify the key shocks and stresses (and transitions) that Rotterdam may face in the future and the resilience and reality lenses, together with the seven resilience qualities helped us to develop and refine our action list.\nSEVEN QUALITIES OF RESILIENCE\nMETHODOLOGY: THE CITY RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK\nWHAT IS RESILIENCE.\nROTTERDAM:\n'SELFIES'\nWe were clear from the beginning that our resilience strategy should both reflect on the past and establish a vision for the future that is relevant across a range of spatial scales - local, district and citywide. We have taken three 'selfies' of the city to support this.\nROTTERDAM THEN\nFrom humble beginnings as a small fishing village we have developed into a 21stCentury World Port City. We have overcome all types of crises and change having experienced flooding, wars and welcoming our many new residents from all over the world - we are now a city with 170 nationalities. We've learned by reflecting on our past that our people can pull together to overcome challenges by creating and planning robust systems and organizations, and that we have a generally inclusive society.\nROTTERDAM NOW\nWe are now at a moment in time where we have come together to consider - in a holistic way - some of the challenges and transitions we will face in the future and to agree between ourselves on a suite of actions that can enhance our city resilience going forward. We foresee a number of transitions on the horizon, these include:\n\u2022\tA changing economy driven more by sharing and technological innovation (\"Next Economy\"),\n\u2022\tA different climate resulting from predicted climate change\n\u2022\tChanges in society and democracy driven by a move away from top-down hierarchy, to a more bottom up approach with much greater levels of community and citizen involvement.\nWe recognise that we don't know everything - there will be other unknown transitions and we have to be prepared for these.\nROTTERDAM TOMORROW\nWe must also have a vision for Rotterdam in the future, for a resilient city. This needs to be understood by a range of stakeholders. Our visions and goals - set out later in this document - begin to paint a picture for a Resilient Rotterdam. Our identified projects and initiatives support and build on this picture. The selfie we envisage for 20301\nOUR RESILIENCE CHALLENGES.\nWe believe we have a strong track record on resilience, but we want to build on this platform and take our city resilience to the next level. Our challenge is to respond to a number of transitions happening in parallel that are potentially disruptive if not dealt with properly and to work hard to realize policies and actions that provide benefits in each - or many - of these areas.\nUsing the 100 Resilient Cities methodology we defined six focus areas which represent our main resilience challenges. These are:\n1.\tSocial cohesion and education\n2.\tEnergy transition\n3.\tClimate adaptation\n4.\tCyber use and security\n5.\tCritical infrastructure\n6.\tChanging urban governance\nBased on our discoveries when focusing on these challenge areas we were able to develop a vision for a resilient Rotterdam together with a range of actions and initiatives aimed at specifically responding to the challenges identified. Our actions or initiatives are often cross cutting and address a number or all of the challenge areas.\n\"MOVING FROM ROBUST TO RESILIENT.\"\nROTTERDAM RESILIENT CITY.\nRotterdam will work to embed resilience thinking into all of our city planning and delivery functions. We want to build on our heritage and past successes to take our city resilience to the next level. Robust is no longer enough, we want to become more flexible and engage community groups and other partners to work together to explore the synergies between our areas of work and to deliver cobenefits. We want the whole city to join ini\nRotterdam is thriving again. After dominating lists of poor performance for long time, progress is being made. We\nare now celebrating the city centre, 75 years after it was destroyed in World War II. Safety has improved and Rotterdammers are amongst the happiest people in the Netherlands. The successful organisation of our country and city has brought us relative prosperity and a pleasant and safe place to live.\nOur strength is built on robustness, planning and control, but we foresee a number of new transitions and challenges and will have to stay alert and be prepared to build capacity to adapt to these changes.\n26 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY\n\"TYPICAL FOR ROTTERDAM:\nMAKE IT HAPPEN!\"\nThe 21st century will see significant city growth for Rotterdam. We have a track record of dealing with challenges, and have proven on numerous occasions that we can overcome crisis and profit from new opportunities offered by adapting to a changing environment and context. Often these challenges have served to make us more robust and efficient. We are certain that in the future we will also need to become more flexible - seeking greater participation from citizens and stakeholders.\nBy working together, we can harness the energy that exists in our society to let ideas grow, giving space\nand facilitating connection between people and the establishment of resilience networks.\nIn order to realize the vision we have established 7 resilience goals:\n1.\tRotterdam: a balanced society\n2.\tWorld Port City built on clean and reliable energy\n3.\tRotterdam Cyber Port City\n4.\tClimate Adaptive city to a new level\n5.\tInfrastructure ready for the 21stcentury\n6.\tRotterdam network - Truly our city\n7.\tAnchoring resilience in the city\nEach goal is accompanied by flywheel actions and additional actions. Fly wheel actions are our bigger actions which will make big leaps towards Rotterdam reaching a citywide state of resilience, while the additional actions contribute with lesser impact. Our resilience thinking has resulted in the identification of many new actions, as well as where appropriate, framing ongoing projects or initiatives to deliver a resilience dividend.\nTHE STORY OF THE CITY.\nThe resilience strategy is not meant as a blueprint or end product, but as a starting point to show:\n\u2022\twhich activities, projects and programs already contribute to resilience;\n\u2022\thow we can connect and enhance the existing instruments and initiatives;\n\u2022\thow new activities can enhance city resilience.\nResilience thinking is being incorporated in the\npolicymaking and initiatives across all domains of city government, including across social, physical and economic programmes. These elements come together in \"The Story of the City\". The resilience strategy and \"The Story of the City\" are complementary. The latter sets out the kind of city we want Rotterdam to be, the Resilience Strategy shows how we can achieve this in a resilient way.\nWe have developed our own Resilience Compass, intended as a point of reference to help us to frame our actions and to guide the transition from a robust present towards a resilient future. Moving from a robust Rotterdam our actions need to respond to one or more resilience themes (see City Resilience Framework), they must deliver a resilience dividend, set a clear goal and involve key stakeholders, including potential partners, funders and agencies. Our strategy articulates flywheel actions (i.e. the headline actions) and additional supporting actions. Some of the resilience actions seek to build on and enhance existing projects and initiatives others are new.\nOUR RESILIENCE\nGOALS.\nROTTERDAM AIMS TO BECOME A CITY IN WHICH RESILIENCE THINKING HAS BEEN ANCHORED IN DAILY LIFE, AS WELL AS IN THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY COMPANIES, INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS. SPECIFICALLY WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THE FOLLOWING GOALS:\n1.\tRotterdam: A balanced society\n2.\tWorld port city built on clean and reliable energy\n3.\tRotterdam Cyber Port City\n4.\tClimate resilient Rotterdam to the next level\n5.\tInfrastructure ready for the 21st century\n6.\tRotterdam Networkcity - truly our city\n7.\tAnchoring resilience in the city\n\"Skilled and healthy citizens in a balanced society\"\nWe seek to build and strengthen resilience at\nthe individual and the societal level. Knowledge, skills, education, health and wellbeing and mutual understanding and respect are central pillars of a balanced society. We will support and enhance a number of ongoing processes and initiatives to support the resilience of Rotterdam's citizens and society working alongside the existing Social Perspectives program (Foresight Social).\n21st century skills\nAt the individual level, we need to provide learning skills and suitable education for life and work in the 21st century, including leadership skills. We want our young people to be ready to work in the 'Next Economy', to contribute and benefit from the digital revolution and to take ownership of their own future and responsibility for fellow citizens and their communities\nHEALTH\nWe will focus on the health of the individual citizen, implementing a suite of tools and actions focused on specific groups and problems. Before summer 2016 we will launch our policy document focused on Public Health.\nWE-SOCIETY\nGlobal and local trends or sudden events can\n\"unbalance\" the Rotterdam society. For example the growth of migration which causes a greater diversity of norms and values. Also the crises beyond the Netherlands and Europe (wars and terrorist attacks) are of concern for the people of Rotterdam, with the attacks in Paris and Brussels still fresh in our minds we are endeavouring to prevent these tensions from disrupting our lives and the city. Recently all national and regional response and action planning has been reviewed and updated. It is crucial that the city invests in monitoring tensions in society and in social cohesion and resilience. The program WE-Society builds openness and mutual understanding (nothing to be unspoken) between people and is essential for maintaining the connections between different groups of people in Rotterdam. We will support and work to enhance and develop this programme to deliver positive resilience outcomes.\nSTRONG SHOULDERS\nThe program Strong Shoulders, reinforced by measures from the Woonvisie (vision for housing and living), is working to support a balanced population demographic in Rotterdam and specifically to attract highly educated people to the city. The resilience programme will support this initiative.\n\"Towards a flexible energy infrastructure for an efficient and sustainable energy mix in Port and City.\"\nRotterdam wants to be the front runner in the clean energy transition and support recent political agreements through COP21 in Paris. The appetite for and evolution of sustainable energy technologies will have a great influence on the city and the port of Rotterdam. We are striving for a diversification of energy sources and to make the urban energy infrastructure more flexible, in order to successfully deliver this clean energy. Delivering this transition is a large and complex task, but it provides the opportunity for Rotterdam to strengthen its economy and reputation. The current and planned activities of the\nport of Rotterdam (Bioport), the roadmap Next Economy for 'a zero carbon' future (Smart Energy Delta) and the measures of the Rotterdam's sustainability program focused on renewable energy and energy conservation support this agenda. New actions are underway to underline the urgency of this transition. The Rotterdam energy infrastructure plan will give direction to the strategy for energy diversification at a district level, each with a roadmap for implementation. The port-industrial cluster will make and carry out an action plan in a joint effort with industries, government and the Rotterdam Port Authority. The Rotterdam sustainability program will be reinforced with new actions as follow up from COP21.\n\"Rotterdam aims to be a cyber resilient city and port; an important condition required to attract new business and investment\"\nThe digitization of society offers many opportunities (Digital Gateway Rotterdam, Smart City), but risks of disruption of essential processes for production, logistics and services also increase. While the investments in Cyber increase at a rate of 27% per year, the investments in cyber security only increase at a rate of 4 %.The necessity of a cyber resilient port of Rotterdam was recognized by the Mayor, chief prosecutor and Chief of Police in 2014. Together with the Rotterdam Port Authority and Daltalinqs (representing 700 companies) they have ordered a strategy on cyber resilience. Individual companies and organizations can have their own security in order, but they are also dependent on other companies, organizations and government services. The resilience of Rotterdam to cyber threats will be increased by enhancing awareness, sharing knowledge and experience and joining forces to improve responsiveness and ICT products. Both the port and city are taking cyber security seriously, they share experiences and have worked with Microsoft to develop comparable strategies and actions comprising 15 building blocks including a Cyber Resilience Platform, Cyber Resilience Desk, Cyber Resilience Co-op and a Port Cyber Resilience Officer. Rotterdam needs a Delta plan for Cyber Resilience. Rotterdam will have implemented its cyber resilience strategy within 5 years and will have significantly enhanced its cyber resilience.\n\"Climate proof\nplus cyber proof\ncritical infrastructure\"\nThe approach and practice established in Rotterdam's climate adaptation strategy (2013) serves as an example to many other cities in the world. Implemented projects such as Water Sensitive Rotterdam - the construction of small and larger water storage combined with greening often initiated by citizens - is contributing to the resilience of Rotterdam. We need to build on this, to scale up the benefits. Clever water management approaches can deliver financial benefits. We will work to better understand cascading impacts and to factor these in to our cost benefit decision making (e.g. prolonged power outage or cyber threat). We will also strengthen our crisis management approaches based on increased knowledge of flood risks. Based on research conducted by TNO we have agreed that we must enhance our climate resilience strategy by taking action on cyber resilience. All stakeholders must start collaborating on this agenda that can help us to further climate proof the city.\n\"A robust and resilient underground infrastructure as a physical basis for a resilient Rotterdam\"\nMuch of Rotterdam's underground infrastructure is crucial for the city to function. Today, our underground infrastructure is robust but lacks flexibility to respond to emergencies, new technological developments and over ground development growth is limited. This brings some risks related to repair capacity, delivery of sub-optimal solutions and poor integration of above and below ground services. We want to increase resilience by\nenhancing the awareness of risk, developing a policy for more robust decision making; more integrated planning practice both underground and overground, relating to infrastructural interventions.\nThis requires a reinforcement of cooperation among all infrastructure managers, including the city as a platform to share plans and (often confidential) knowledge\nand information. We are going to create more specific databases and information on the location of infrastructure and functions and interdependencies of the subsurface. We will also explore how innovative SMART technology can be integrated into the \"Street of the Future\". Our resilience strategy commits to action in each of these areas.\n\"Residents, public and private organizations, businesses and knowledge institutions together determine the resilience of the city\"\nOur society is well organized. The city is being created by the Rotterdammers, therefore it is 'truly our city.\nThe local government is one amongst many other stakeholders. How do we manage to become resilient? The way the Rotterdam society operates has many characteristics of resilience including self-organization, strong networks and various coalitions of citizens and businesses and a government offering customised services and a facilitating role with programs like the Right to Challenge and CityLabOlO.\nOur resilience increases as more alternative organisations arise, but more effort is needed to incorporate resilience thinking into the DNA of the government and to use and strengthen the energy of Rotterdam's society. The resilience strategy will focus on increasing government flexibility and will facilitate connecting several networks of locals, individuals and businesses, as a catalyst for more bottom-up community and business initiatives, to share knowledge and experiences to the advantage of Rotterdam's people and businesses. Our future\ngovernment will handle new ideas better and work to harness and augment the energy that derives from our communities and will accept more redundancy providing more alternatives during outing of services and operations. We have committed to actions including developing the cities desk for new democracy and participation and providing support to existing networks, citywide and at district level because they directly contribute to the resilience of our city's governance.\nTOWARDS A RESILIENT GOVERNANCE OF THE CITY\n\"With stakeholders in the neighbourhoods, sharing knowledge and a facilitating organization\"\nWe will develop an innovation and integration agenda on the back of this resilience strategy. We want to identify co-benefits and synergies. For example, strengthening the cyber resilience in Rotterdam strengthens the security of critical infrastructure. Working on 21st century skills of Rotterdam, including ICT skills,\ncontributes to the cyber resilience. We think these synergies are very important to our strategy and will seek to explore these further. One way we will do this is within district pilot areas. A number of actions and themes can come together physically at the neighbourhood or building level.\nOur resilience strategy names three pilot districts. These are Feijenoord, Delfshaven and the City Centre. We have initiatives that relate to a number of different scales, as follows:\n1.\tBuilding (example: Resilient Peperklip)\n2.\tNeighbourhood (example: Resilient Delfshaven)\n3.\tCity (example: Nationaal Programma Rotterdam Zuid)\n4.\tMetropolitan Area (example: Roadmap Next economy together with The Hague)\n5.\tNational (example: Citydeal Climate Adaptation)\n6.\tEuropean (example: resilient Europe, URBACT)\n7.\tWorldwide (example: 100 Resilient Cities)\nInnovation will also be encouraged through\ncomprehensive integrated research with public and private stakeholders at different scales. This includes knowledge development and knowledge exchange between 100 Resilient Cities cities, like the Rotterdam hosted exchange in October 2015. In the short term we will use the International Architecture Biennale (2018 and 2020) and The International Advisory Board (2017) to address resilience as their main topics.\nRESILIENT CITIES HELP EACH OTHER\nHOW\tWHO\nTactics for living with water\nRotterdam Water Exchange October 2015 The stories of nine cities\nThe International Water Exchange, powered by the Rockefeller Foundation 100 Resilient Cities\nRotterdam Centre for Resilient Delta Cities\nURBACT: Resilient Europe\nThe stories of twelve cities working\ntoward social resilience\nURBACT: Resilient Europe programme\nAntwerp, Bristol, Burgas, Glasgow, Katowice, Malmo, Potenza, Rome, Rotterdam, Thessaloniki, Vejle and the EU\nBilateral exchange\nRotterdam partners active in cities\nCities of Rotterdam, Rome, New Orleans en Glasgow\nRotterdam Centre for Resilient Delta Cities,\nThe cities of Vejle, Mexico-Stad, Chennai-Stad\nMOVING TO IMPLEMENTATION\nIt is recognised that delivering the Rotterdam resilience strategy will need to be a collaborative effort between the City of Rotterdam, businesses, citizens and other organizations, but that the city government has a key role to facilitate and initiate projects, and to provide leadership and the necessary strategic framework.\nThe development of the Rotterdam Resilience Strategy has benefitted greatly from the executive sponsorship of Mayor Aboutaleb and the city has made a top level commitment to continue work to implement its resilience strategy in an integrated way up to 2020 at least.\n\"OUR AMBITION IS TO ANCHOR RESILIENCE THINKING IN THE CITY.\"\nThis document has been released for consultation.\nThe process and organizational structure to realize the resilience strategy will be further defined based. Feedback will be organized by using, for example, an e-panel, a jury of citizens and district commissions. Following consultation further links will be made to connect the resilience strategy into the broader Story of the City. This strategy document is accompanied by a website. More detailed information can be found on www.resilientrotterdam.nl\n\"A JOURNEY FOR ALL OF US: JOIN IN!\"\n47\nHIERARCHY\nTO IMPROVE AND SECURE OUR CITY'S RESILIENCE WE WANT ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO CONSIDER THE RESILIENCE PERSPECTIVE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES - IN THEIR THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS. THE ACTIONS PROMOTED THROUGH THIS STRATEGY - COMPRISING 5 WHICH ARE ONGOING, 19 THAT ARE JUST BEGINNING AND 44 THAT ARE COMPLETELY NEW - SHOW SOME OF THE WAYS THAT ROTTERDAM CAN IMPROVE ITS RESILIENCE. OUR CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER SUPPORTS AND PROMOTES THESE ACTIONS.\nOur action plan includes 5 ongoing, 44 new, and 19 starting initiatives and actions. The ongoing initiatives, like Roadmap Next Economy, Water Sensitive Rotterdam and the program WE-Society, are included because they are identified as essential for a resilient Rotterdam. Where necessary these initiatives will be enhanced and developed with resilience thinking and linked to the resilience strategy to deliver positive resilience outcomes, to accelerate upscaling and to allow for lessons learnt and wider dissemination through the resilience office.\nThere are some new actions that are already in start-up phase, partly due to the Resilience program, which will be supported where necessary by the resilience office and other new actions that will serve as examples of how resilience thinking and interventions can be applied at a practical level at the scale of the neighbourhood, street and building. It is expected that further new initiatives will\narise, to enhance the resilience of Rotterdam. The resilience office will focus on connecting, enriching and accelerating these where they are feasible, viable and deliver clear resilience dividends.\nOur actions are distinguished into two types: flywheel actions and additional actions. The flywheel actions are the headline actions that deliver the greatest resilience benefit for Rotterdam or which serve as an umbrella for a cluster of supporting actions. The supporting actions are considered to have less impact individually. We have included a key to help navigation through the actions, letters (i.e. A, B, C) signpost the flywheel actions where numbers (i.e. 1,2, 3) are used for the supporting actions. Synergies and overlaps are shown under 'related actions' and icons are used to relate the actions back the resilience challenge areas, to highlight the resilience qualities within the specified action and to show the scale at which the action is applicable.\nA PROGRAM FOR 21ST\nCENTURY SKILLS AND YOUNG LEADERSHIP\nRELATED ACTIONS\n1\tCENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR 21ST CENTURY SKILLS\nThis is the establishment of a new physical hub, a central point for learning 21stcentury skills in Rotterdam. It will accelerate education and establish a visible, and approachable, innovation hub in the city. The Centre of Expertise will undertake initiatives in education and business, working in collaboration with Rotterdam businesses, schools, the government and private stakeholders.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupporting the development of training programs to increase knowledge and enable the monitoring and evaluation of experiences\n\u2022\tSupports collaboration between public and private sector\n\u2022\tSupports awareness, learning and innovation\n2\tBUILDING A COALITION FOR YOUNG LEADERSHIP\nBuilding on and supporting the growing coalition of businesses, civil society and schools to support the 21stcentury skills program.

The aim of this action is to provide additional resource and support as needed to help the existing coalition deliver on its goals.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports bottom up - community led initiatives and builds cohesion.\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking amongst Rotterdam's youth\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking\n3\t21st CENTURY SKILLS AGENDA\nThe 21stcentury skills programme and the Centre of Excellence will need an agreed curriculum. A 21st century skills' agenda will be prepared by the municipality and Rotterdam's leading educationalists as part of the Citydeal for Education (collaboration with some other Dutch cities and the national government). The curriculum will ensure resilience is on the agenda for the main educational establishments across the city.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tThe curriculum provides transparency and clarity as to what the demands of the 21st century are.\n\u2022\tIt provides a method for embedding resilience thinking into key city educational curriculums (integration into our regular educational program)\n4\tDEVELOPING PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS\nStarting professional networks that teach 21stcentury skills and young leadership within schools and colleges.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022 Establish clear educational\nrelateds between the professionals, municipality and schools in relation to resilience - to share learning experiences, to enhance the network and to allow it to adjust it to changing circumstances based on feedback.\nBUILDING ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACT 2016-2019\nRELATED ACTIONS\n5\nNUDGING' HEALTHY BEHAVIOUR\n(S)\nOur city has already begun research and creating an agenda to identify what motivates goal groups to make behavioural changes to have a healthier lifestyle. We will develop and help disseminate this research to nudge our citizens (and organizations) towards healthier lifestyles, working in collaboration with the Erasmus University Medical Centre.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tEmbeds the notions of healthy behaviour and the required behavioural changes across society, targeted at specific audiences\/target groups\n\u2022\tSupports the self-sufficiency and resilience of citizens (and indirectly organisations and the economy)\n\u2022\tUnderstanding behaviour and the mechanisms that can drive behavioural change can drive efficiencies and cost saving in delivering numerous programmes\/initiatives together. This understanding will support delivery of initiatives that can deliver co-benefits (e.g. disseminating information on safe driving that also delivered fuel efficiency benefit)\nPROGRAM:\nWE-SOCIETY\nRESILIENCE LAB: ACTIONS.\nRELATED ACTIONS\n6\tINTEGRATION TOURS\n\nTalks and events aimed at encouraging cooperation and dialogue between the city government, citizens and other stakeholders (e.g. private sector, NGO's). This action will make citizens aware of their own roles in society and how they can better contribute to city resilience. Talks will cover social and cultural integration issues and seek to break down barriers to effective dialogue.\nSupports knowledge sharing, values alignment and education. These tours bring groups from different backgrounds and roles in society together to discuss different issues that are important for Dutch values.

These tours bring groups from different backgrounds and roles in society together to discuss different issues that are important for Dutch values. The program strengthens mutual understanding of differences in values and stresses what Dutch values stand for.\n7\tTHE G1000 CITIZEN'S SUMMIT\nFoundation LOCAL is organizing a citizen's summit for 2017 It will bring together citizens and civil society and share the results of numerous recent city dialogues (see Action WE-society) that have focussed on key city issues from the citizen perspective. The resilience office will ensure the summit has slots to promote the city's work on resilience and to further education, raise awareness and promote the actions citizens can take to promote resilience. It brings together 1000 citizens that are randomly selected, seeking to provide a broad representation of the diversity in Rotterdam.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tReinforces the good work and dialogues that have already taken place.\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking.\n\u2022\tCan be a catalyst for local level \/ community resilience projects.\n8\tBUILDING RESILIENCE THROUGH CULTURAL ACTIVITIES\nThe Foundation for Arts Education Rotterdam (SKVR) has a program which includes activities with a specific social objective. These activities are offered free of charge or at low rates. One example is to use music to increase resilience at a district level. These activities are developed with social partners in the city and public funds and are co-financed. Aimed at individual citizens the resilience office will work to integrate this activity into its broader resilience programme.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nSupports bottom - up community led initiatives and build cohesion.\n9\t100 HOMES FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS\nThe Foundation Verre Bergen has purchased 100 homes for families seeking asylum in Rotterdam. This forms part of their New Home Rotterdam program's ambition to teach asylum seekers Dutch, assist them to find employment and education and to feel comfortable in their homes and neighbourhoods. This action will be supported and will be connected to wider efforts because it is an excellent example of an initiative contributing to the resilience of Rotterdam. Housing for refugees - and migration more broadly - is an important urban resilience challenge. A number of CRO's within the 100 Resilient Cities network have started a conversation on migration which may lead to a formal exchange. 100 Resilient Cities member cities actively involved in this conversation include: Montreal, Athens, NYC, Thessaloniki, Vejle, Paris, Amman, Ramallah and Byblos. Rotterdam will consider whether we can contribute to this exchange in the future.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports and promotes an integrated and inclusive society.\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking.\n\u2022\tDemonstration of a private sector led initiative that contributes to a city wide goal.\nSTRONG SHOULDERS PROGRAM\nRELATED ACTIONS\n10\tVISION ON HOUSING (WOONVISIE)\nThe Woonvisie is Rotterdam's vision to become an attractive residential city. It promotes attractive living environments, and housing that is future proof. Woonvisie creates a balance in housing for different groups of residents, improving housing quality. As such it has some cross over with the WE-society programme. The Woonvisie is the basis for agreements with all housing corporations and offers a framework for city developers and for the policymakers for the housing of specific goal groups.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tThe Woonvisie is an important instrument to provide adequate housing for different groups in the city supporting the goals of a balanced society and creates inclusiveness.\n\u2022\tSupports Rotterdam's brand and 'pull' as an attractive cosmopolitan city.\n11\tPROMOTING CITIZEN COLLABORATION\nWithin the Strong Shoulders program - supported by field work and surveys - work has been undertaken to consider how high and low-skilled Rotterdammers could work together in effective and harmonious ways. As a result of this work a range of approaches ('how to' guides) were developed. Some of the solutions are straight forward and simple whilst others require an intensive effort to seed more effective collaboration. This agenda needs to be developed and experiences learnt from other cities around the world, and specifically from with the 100 Resilient Cities network.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tContributes to a better understanding of conditions that enhance social cohesion and therefore supports a balanced society and inclusiveness.\n\u2022\tHaving different groups living in one neighbourhood enhances resourcefulness with more viewpoints and perspectives available to create ideas and solutions.\n\u2022\tCan draw on the 100 Resilient Cities network\nROTTERDAM ENERGY\nINFRASTRUCTURE PLAN\nF\nREINFORCING ROTTERDAM MOERDIJK INDUSTRY CLUSTER\nPROGRAM)\nPORT TRANSITION FOCUSED ON\nBIO-BASED ECONOMY\nTURNING A SMART CITY INTO A CYBER RESILIENT CITY (DELTAPLAN CYBER)\nRESILIENCE LAB: ACTIONS.\nRELATED ACTIONS\nA Port Cyber Resilience Working Group has been established to develop and implement the key building blocks, as follows:\n\u2022\tAppoint a Port Cyber Resilience Officer to support coordination\n\u2022\tEstablish a Cyber Co-op to promote cyber products and services, to share learning and encourage private sector engagement\n\u2022\tSet up a Cyber Notification Desk to allow real-time cyber incident notification\n\u2022\tEstablish a Cyber Threat Intelligence Watch to monitor cyber threat signals - actual cyber threats and trends\n\u2022\tPut in place a Cyber Response Team as the first response team with the objective to de-escalate cyber incidents\n\u2022\tEstablish a Cyber Resilience Community of Practice\n\u2022\tBegin structured communication about cyber threats and incidents\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tCreates an approach to detect and deal with the vulnerabilities in the cyber systems that are vital to the functioning of the port and its industries\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking across all port related activities\n13 CYBER BUILDING BLOCKS: CITY\nFor the city a Cyber Resilience Platform will be established to coordinate and start-up actions to implement the cyber resilience building blocks. These actions include:\n\u2022\tEstablishing the Cyber Resilience platform\n\u2022\tDeveloping a programme around Cyber Awareness\n\u2022\tDeveloping a learning programme around Cyber Competences.\n\u2022\tEstablishing a Cyber Co-op to promote cyber products and services, to share learning and encourage private sector engagement\n\u2022\tDeveloping codes of practice and requirements for cyber products and services\n\u2022\tCollecting learning on Cyber Disruption\n\u2022\tEstablishing a Cyber Resilience Community of Practice\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tCreates an approach to detect and deal with the vulnerabilities in the cyber systems that are vital to the functioning of the city and stakeholders including the citizens.\nSupports knowledge sharing and networking.\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking across all city related activities.\nCyber resilience is a key focus in London and Singapore. This action will further explore opportunities for city to city knowledge transfer within the cyber field, drawing on the 100 Resilient Cities city network and specialists from amongst the 100 Resilient Cities platform partners. Microsoft has already provided support to Rotterdam in relation to cyber security.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing, innovation and networking.\n\u2022\tCreates efficiency through resource and knowledge sharing.\nRESILIENCE LAB: ACTIOS.\n15\tCYBER RESILIENCE OF INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION\nThe cyber resilience of all automated infrastructure that is run by the municipality will be evaluated against vulnerabilities to identify cyber threats. Once the threats are understood an action plan will be developed to mitigate risks.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022 Ensures that cyber resiliency is considered specifically as an important condition to keep the municipal infrastructure running.\n16\tCYBER RESILIENCE OF SMART CITY INITIATIVES\nRotterdam is developing a Smart City program and already carrying out different smart initiatives. The cyber resilience of the Rotterdam Smart City Programme initiative will be assessed and relateded to the development of the cyber resilience building blocks.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022 Ensures that as new smart technology is deployed for efficiency and sustainability benefits the cyber risk and resilience issues are thoroughly considered; an important element in developing a smart city programme.\n17\tCYBER COLLABORATION - METROPOLITAN AREA\nThis action will facilitate collaboration across the Rotterdam -The Hague Metropolitan Area level, specifically sharing knowledge and resources on the topic of cyber and water management. Research findings and \/ or actions identified through this collaboration will be integrated within the building blocks of the city and port cyber resilience strategies. Opportunities will be sought to jointly secure grant funding, such as from the EU. We will seek to open up communication channels between our metropolitan collaborators and with our international collaborators (see Action Cyber collaboration - London and Singapore).\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022 Supports knowledge sharing and networking across the region and internationally\nWATER SENSITIVE\nROTTERDAM (WSR)\n18\tZOHO: 1ST CLIMATE-PROOF DISTRICT\nZomerhofkwartier (Zoho) together with the support of users of the area (residents, businesses, organizations and visitors) has undergone a gradual urban regeneration. A neighbourhood which previously had a lot of empty commercial units has been transformed into a district where everything is possible, with 120 companies now operating in the area. The unique multifunctional Waterplein Benthemplein acted as a catalyst project for further development of Zoho. Climate adaptation was found to act as a driver for sustainable development and has strengthened social cohesion. The resilience office will collect experiences learnt in Zoho and scale them up to other districts and the surrounding areas. The district and wider region can therefore be used as an example for how to scale up green and creative solutions for water retention whilst also strengthening community relateds and building knowledge capital.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nUsing climate adaptation as the driver the Zoho project has successfully integrated urban design, landscape, arts and community projects to provide a catalyst for a whole scale regeneration of a district in Rotterdam. It is a fantastic example of how combining a suite of initiatives in a single area together with careful community and business consultation and engagement can deliver a range of beneficial outcomes. This district is now more resilient to flooding, more self-sufficient and has a stronger and more connected community. The challenge now is to take the learning from Zoho and apply it in other districts in Rotterdam. This can help to disseminate resilience thinking, encourage participation and support learning.\nCYBER PROOF WATER SYSTEM\nADAPTIVE\nWATERFRONT\nDEVELOPMENT\nRESILIENCE LAB: ACTIONS.\nRELATED ACTIONS\n19\tPLAN FOR CLIMATE RESILIENT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\nAn important part of the Delta Program is \"spatial adaptation\", such as spatial adjustments to the existing city within the dykes. An important part of this is critical infrastructure. A new spatial plan will be developed based on regional analysis of critical infrastructure resilience to climate change.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing, innovation and networking.\n\u2022\tA spatial overlay and mapping can deliver co-benefits in considering development growth opportunities and overlaying other considerations such as socio-economic metrics, renewable energy potential and broader infrastructure opportunities and constraints.\n20\tVERTICAL EVACUATION PLANNING\nAn important part of the National Delta Program is the concept of \"multi-layer safety\". This involves prevention (1st layer) spatial adaptation (2nd layer) and evacuation (3rd layer). The evacuation layer has yet to be fully planned and developed. The pilot study \"crisis management during floods\" found that vertical evacuation needs proper consideration as a serious option for layer 3. Specifically, consideration should be given to the fact that the highest areas are located along the river, outside the dykes and the entire port area. We will develop a vertical evacuation plan as part of our resilience strategy implementation.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022 Supports preparedness and embeds considerations for evacuation into all aspects of the city and port.\n21 CLIMATE RESILIENT WATERFRONT AREAS\nooo\nIn 2014 the National Delta Programme was established. In Rotterdam, as part of the Rotterdam Adaptation Strategy, there are a diverse range of pilot studies which focus on climate resilient development in the wider region; looking at both urban and industrial areas. Some include Pilot Noordereiland, Pilot Botlek, Pilot Feijenoord, Pilot Crisis management and flooding. The results of these pilots will be collated and translated into overall policy for the area outside the dykes in Rotterdam.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking\n\u2022\tDevelopment of new strategies for floodprone areas.\n\u2022\tEmbeds climate resilient thinking into all areas of Rotterdam.\nThe Rotterdam-The Hague Emergency Airport (RHEA) will create an economic cluster focussing on clean technology and water security in an airport setting. As a 'safe haven', the site can be an excellent example of water security in The Netherlands (demonstrating multi-layer security: 3rd Layer). We will establish a knowledge and training centre for service providers, business, research, NGOs and aid organisations that will tap into RHEA companies and scientists specialized in clean technology products in the region.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nThis centre will serve as a demonstrator for Rotterdam. It will achieve a critical mass of organisations and institutes that will be a catalyst for innovation and research. The cluster will support resilience goals around water, energy transitions and next economy \/ 21s,century skills.\nIt will provide a safe area in case of regional emergencies and a base from which support can be delivered to disaster prone areas around the world.\nThe municipality of Rotterdam - through their Climate Proof and Adaptation Strategy - have stated an ambition to explore opportunities presented by building floating developments. The Floating Pavilion was our first move. This was followed by floating houses in the Nassau Harbour, Experimental Zone Aqua Dock and innovative designs for a floating farm and water treatment. Upscaling of these approaches and bringing them into the mainstream is our next step and is an action we will take forward as part of implementing our resilience strategy.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports innovation in climate resilient building and infrastructure provision\n\u2022\tRaises awareness of climate risks\nCOOPERATION\nBETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS\nTHE SUBSURFACE ABOVE GROUND\n24\tANALYTICAL RESEARCH ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND FEATURES IN THE SUBSURFACE\nGaining a better understanding of interdependencies and cascading effects as well as insight into the most fragile assets of the critical underground networks will allow opportunities for increasing resilience to be identified. This will require a full assessment and investigation of the existing networks in Rotterdam. This assessment will be taken forward as an action associated with the implementation of this resilience strategy.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking across all activities related to critical underground infrastructure.\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking.\n\u2022\tHelps to tease out synergies between critical infrastructure and other resilience goals.\n25\tQUICK SCAN OF SELF-RELIANCE\nThis action will provide a scan of the extent to which residents of Rotterdam are or can be self-reliant in terms of disruptions to critical infrastructure (long term power failures, heating, drinking water supply, etc).\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports greater understanding of residual vulnerabilities from infrastructure disruptions.\n\u2022\tProvides context on community and business resilience activities and investment\n\u2022\tSupports understanding of the role government can play in providing back up services during emergencies.\n26\tCOST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF INFRASTRUCTURE DECISION MAKING\nGenerally, risk management and spatial planning do not consider the costs and benefits of development in the longer term (i.e. the full life cycle considerations), but this can support effective decision making and help make the case for investment in redundancy. This is particularly prevalent in the context of underground critical infrastructure. The action will seek to determine how through cost benefit analysis can support infrastructure decision making, including for example, approaches to take account of the value of the subsurface space taken up by the infrastructure.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022 Embeds resilience thinking and proper (lifecycle) cost benefit analysis into critical underground infrastructure decision making and delivery\n27\tTHE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSET\nMANAGEMENT FOR OUR UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE\nThe municipality of Rotterdam's asset management team used to maintain and manage all assets in public spaces as well as manage a risk register. This included for items such as bridges and quay walls and also green spaces and lighting. Asset management not only considers the costs and current status of the assets themselves but also the potential risks that the failure of the assets could have on the functioning of the city. By mapping the risks, decisions can be made as to what measures should and should not be performed based on a balance of performance, risk and cost. Smart investments now can often deliver savings in the future.\nThis action will develop protocols for the asset management of underground infrastructure, intended to support decision making in respect of maintenance and replacement.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking into the management of current assets as well as future planned and developed.\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing, specifically of infrastructure risks amongst infrastructure providers and developers.\nSTREET OF THE FUTURE\nACTIVE CITIZENS\nROTTERDAM NETWORK CITY\n28\tWORLD EXPO 2025\nWorld Expo 2025 is an initiative led by a group of Rotterdam entrepreneurs. Their plan includes a ten-year economic program that culminates during the Exhibition in 2025. The Expo will last six months and attract an estimated twenty million visitors. Only the Dutch Government can put Rotterdam forward as a candidate for the Expo; a decision has yet to be taken on this. The municipality has approved the plan and agrees that the spatial integration contributes to the necessary infrastructure upgrades. Additionally, proposed is an 'Expo Works' authority, which is a special program aimed at creating jobs for young people in Rotterdam. The theme of the World Expo 2025 would be 'Rotterdam Changing Currents', with one of the subthemes titled 'Deltas in Transition'.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports inward investment in development and infrastructure and can leave a legacy (see Lisbon, Milan etc).\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking to wide range of activities.\nRESILIENCE LAB: ACTIONS.\n29\tINTERNATIONAL ADVISORY BOARD AND RESILIENCE\nThe International Advisory Board Rotterdam (IAB) is a unique advisory council made up of international leaders in academia and the private and public sectors. The IAB meets once every two years to advise the Municipal Executive of Rotterdam on economic and other aspects of urban development. The IAB serves as a sounding board for the Municipal Executive on issues related to international economic developments. The IAB is currently chaired by Jan Peter Balkenende, former prime minister of the Netherlands. Rotterdam with partners, we will explore the possibilities to address Resilience as main topic for the IAB 2017.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022 Supports knowledge sharing,\ninnovation and networking and builds the profile of the Rotterdam Resilience Programme.\n30\tCITY MAKERS CONGRESS\nAn annual congress in which a wide range of interested parties from the city, such as developers, housing corporations, design agencies and interest groups collaborate on design issues in the city. The aim is that through city labs issues are addressed and solutions are devised. The resilience office will support this congress and bring resilience to the table for discussion.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports bottom up - community led initiatives and builds cohesion.\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking to wide range of activities and stakeholders\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing, innovation and networking.\nNEIGHBOURHOOD ORIENTED GOVERNANCE\nLed by local entrepreneurs, an opportunity map was developed which identified a series of initiatives.\nIn cooperation with the municipality a strategy for how these should be realized is being developed, with the aim to deliver a robust self-supporting network. The next steps have been established with this strategy acting as a test case for the creation of an effective and efficient network at the neighbourhood level. The aim is to facilitate this development process and to learn from it, allowing lessons to be learnt and taken forward to other areas across the city.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports bottom up - community led initiatives and builds cohesion.\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking.\n\u2022\tSupports innovation and future thinking across all scales.\nThe City of Rotterdam together with the Erasmus University will start a Governance Lab, a joint initiative to come through design research to strengthen the organizational capacity of the city. This initiative is organized in line with the Rotterdam Resilience Strategy and is intended for use by design and action research to implement the city's vision of resilience. Many elements of the resilience strategy relate to the mobilization and utilization of a self-organizing, able society, and the market increasing the resilience of the city. A joint Governance Lab should make it possible to bring together the knowledge questions from Rotterdam and the research interests of the EUR and matching. It is important that the municipality combines knowledge questions and invests in the lab, especially as the university is looking towards current research programs in space, to capitalise on this knowledge. Ultimately, it comes to designing research: the translation of scientific theory and empirical research into useful concepts and designs for the practice of the city (via experimental, designing and action research).\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nA resilient system of governance is\nthe foundation for a resilient city. The\nestablishment of the resilient system of\ngovernance is situationally determined,\nand requires room for experimentation,\nimprovisation and learning.\nA new type of control and participation at the district level, Delfshaven Cooperative began in 2015 as a foundation; working towards a cooperative where likeminded committed people could work together for Bospolder\/Tussendijken. By bringing together large companies and institutions with local residents initiatives can create benefits for all parties involved. The goal is to increase the performance opportunities of the place and for its people in the long term. The Delfshaven Cooperative is an innovation in working and should be monitored in order to draw lessons to be shared with other districts.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports bottom up - community led initiatives and builds cohesion.\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking\n34\tDEVELOPMENT OPEN DATA PLATFORM\nRotterdam has developed an online data log www.rotterdamopendata.nl. From this site it is possible for anyone to open datasets regardless of the content and conditionally use it. Through active sharing of data it is expected that there will be increased economic and innovation activities as well as new forms of cooperation to better develop the economy and Rotterdam as a smart city. The site also encourages greater participation and self-reliance. Although Rotterdam is among one of the frontrunners in Europe, the municipality still wants to further increase close cooperation between the government, citizens, businesses and knowledge institutions in the city and wider region, moving to a relationship whereby these parties can freely share ideas and datasets (open data). This action will ensure the ongoing development and dissemination of learning from the open data portal.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports bottom up - community led initiatives and builds cohesion.\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking\n35\tFURTHER DEVELOP DIGITAL\nINFORMATION AND INSPIRATION PLATFORM\nRotterdammers are bursting with great ideas for their city. The municipality works to harness this through various online platforms: www.rotterdam.nl\/meedenkenendoen (to find inspiration and information) and www.citylab010.nl (to share innovative plans). It is however recognized that improvements to these could be made to increase customer-usability and consequently to inspire more people. This action will develop and enhance the existing citylabOlO platform.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\n\u2022\tSupports bottom up - community led initiatives and builds cohesion.\n\u2022\tEmbeds resilience thinking\n\u2022\tSupports knowledge sharing and networking\n\u2022\tBuilds profile\nNATIONAL PROGRAM ROTTERDAM ZUID\nROADMAP TO THE NEXT ECONOMY\n1 KM2 SUSTAINABLE ROOFSCAPE CITY CENTRE\n36\tSMART SCHOUWBURGPLEIN 7 SQUARE ENDEAVOUR\nThe aim here is to create a pleasant living environment around the Schouwburgplein for all users, which is also future proof. The square and surrounding area should not only support healthy and active lifestyles but also provide enjoyment for users. Sustainability is an integral component taking into account clean energy, recycling of materials, additional water storage and Smart Grid. This project on street level can function as a catalyst project comparable to the water square.

degree possible, we can reduce our reliance on crisis as a driver of change and,\ninstead, deliberately take the\nfuture into our own hands -for the well-being of our families, our communities, our cities, and indeed, the planet we all share.\u201d\nFrom The Resilience Dividend by DR. JUDITH RODIN\nPresident of The Rockefeller Foundation\nLianne Dalziel\nMayor\nChristchurch City Council\nDame Margaret Bazley\nChair\nCanterbury Regional Council\nKelvin Coe\nMayor\nSelwyn District Council\nDavid Ayers\nMayor\nWaimakiriri District Council\nTa Mark Solomon\nKaiwhakahaere\nTe Runanga o Ngai Tahu\nRESILIENCE is a word we have heard a lot in Greater Christchurch over the past five years. No matter what extent to which we are familiar with this word in our day-to-day lives, it is important that we collectively understand the concept of resilience. We know that we will encounter future challenges. This is not simply about preparing our infrastructure or our built environment and it's not about bouncing back to the way things used to be. For us, resilience will be about understanding the risks and challenges we face and developing ways to adapt and co-create a new normal. The strength of our resilience lies in us, not just as\nindividuals, but as communities and whanau.\nThis Resilient Greater Christchurch Plan enables us as city and district leaders\nto work together to enable and empower our communities to face the future with confidence.\nAs a group of leaders we were already working together before the earthquakes struck. The Urban Development Strategy (UDS) has as its vision:\nBy the year 2041, Greater Christchurch has a vibrant inner city, and\nsuburban centres surrounded by thriving rural communities and towns\nconnected by efficient and sustainable infrastructure. There are a wealth\nof public spaces ranging from bustling inner city streets to expansive open spaces and parks, which embrace natural systems, landscape and heritage.\nInnovative businesses are welcome and can thrive supported by a wide\nrange of attractive facilities and opportunities.\nProsperous communities can enjoy a variety of lifestyles in good health and safety, enriched by the diversity of cultures and the beautiful environment of Greater Christchurch.\nWe see this resilience plan as enabling the review of the strategy to occur with a resilience lens and an ongoing commitment from each of us to visible collaborative leadership. As we shift from recovery to regeneration, we can restate the importance of collaboration; between the city, the districts and the region, Central Government, the Canterbury District Health Board and most importantly with the many and varied communities that make up this special part of New Zealand.\nE topa atu ra taku manu taki i te tihi o Aoraki Matatu, ko tona reo mihi ka tuku atu i te hau ki nga manawa tit! o Waitaha nei.\nTena tatou i runga i tenei kaupapa whakahirahira; ma te mahi tahi, ma te whirika o te taura takata, ma te taukaea o te aroha ka whakapakaritia a Otautahi. Na, i runga i tera kai te mihi, kai te mihi, tena ra koutou katoa.\nNgai Tahu are a resilient, entrepreneurial people who made our home\nin Te Waipounamu (the South Island of New Zealand) over 800 years ago.\nOur ancestors were the first long distance seafarers, navigating by stars on voyaging waka from Hawaiki Nui. We learnt to adapt quickly to the formidable environment of the South Pacific, growing our communities\nand culture around mahinga kai and with strong adherence to values\nsuch as whanaungatanga (family) and kaitiakitanga (stewardship).\nFollowing the earthquakes, our marae opened their doors to all who needed\nsupport and our tribal organisations fell in behind to co-ordinate further support.\nIndividual iwi and Maori collectives from throughout the country extended their immense aroha by fundraising and sending us resources. I remember the day after the fatal earthquake of February 22 when Ngai Tahu and other Maori community leaders in Christchurch met at Rehua Marae. The Chairman\nof Te Runanga o Nga Matawaka, Norm Dewes, approached me and said quietly, \u201cMark, there's no you, no me, just we?\u201d I smiled. He was right; that's how we\nmoved, and that's how we built our strength. We continued our work in the months and years that followed. This extended to being firm advocates for the importance of our environment and today we consistently advocate for greater recognition and provision for the wellbeing of land and water resources across all forums. Our health depends on the health of these resources.\nI want to acknowledge the great strides that have been taken by our city, region and nation following the earthquakes in respect of working collaboratively together with iwi at the table. It hasn't always been an easy union, and it has often taken us more time to make decisions. But perhaps it has also been easier than some of us might have expected and we have discovered a lot about each other. We are on a new pathway of civic leadership in New Zealand that is visionary and will lead to more enduring outcomes. I am reminded of one of our ancestor's assessment of the Treaty of Waitangi agreement and vision for our future. Matiaha Tiramorehu's words (quoted below) in a petition to Queen Victoria are inscribed on the south wall of Christchurch's Civic Centre, Te Hononga, a joint development by the Christchurch City Council and Ngai Tahu, a home for civic leadership.\nThis was the command thy love laid upon these Governors. That the law be made one. That the commandments be made one. That the nation\nbe made one. That the white skin be made just equal with the dark skin,\nand to lay down the love of thy graciousness to the Maori that they dwell happily and that all men might enjoy a peaceful life, and the Maori remember the power of thy name.\nTa Mark Solomon\nKaiwhakahaere, Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu\nTHE CANTERBURY EARTHQUAKES -A SHOCK THAT TESTED OUR RESILIENCE\nIn October 2013 the City of Christchurch applied to The RockefellerFoundation\nto take part in their 100 Resilient Cities Centennial Challenge. The letter of application was one of the first official acts by the incoming Mayor. The application envisioned an internal network within New Zealand, so that not only could Christchurch learn from what it had been through, but so it could also share its experiences with the rest of the world. Our application was based on a desire to increase our social capital and bring about real change by embracing participatory planning and collaborative decision-making. Our membership would be an enduring legacy to the city and the nation.\nThe Canterbury Earthquake Sequence that began on 4 September 2010 contained\nfour main earthquakes and thousands of aftershocks. The initial 7.0 magnitude event at Darfield, 40 kilometres west of Christchurch resulted in widespread, although localised, damage. The second 6.3 magnitude earthquake of 22 February 2011 - centred just east of the city - was one of New Zealand's worst natural disasters. One hundred and eighty five people died. A state of national emergency, the first in New Zealand's history, was declared on 23 February and stayed in place until 30 April. The unusual aspect of this earthquake (and the June and December events that followed) was their very strong shaking relative to the size of the earthquake. The 22 February event produced the highest vertical and horizontal ground accelerations (how hard the earth shakes) ever recorded in New Zealand.\nAlongside the tragic loss of life, more than 8000 households were permanently displaced by land damage, 90% of residential properties were damaged in some way and 80% of buildings in the Central Business District have had to be demolished.\nI felt the aftershocks\nwere like a home invasion -you close your curtains and you lock your door when you go to bed at night and they\nenter into your house without an invite.\nLOUISE SWATTON QuakeStories.govt.nz\nA CALL TO ACTION\nIt is now nearly six years since the beginning of the Canterbury Earthquake Sequence. A time filled with loss: of life, heritage, communities and many other things. Also a time of strength. Strength found in a neighbour's helping hand, in emergent community organisations like the Student Volunteer Army, CANCERN and the Farmy Army; and renewed hope for our communities' thriving future together. Although some are still battling with the aftermath of our shared trauma, and we must stand with them in compassion and solidarity, it is also an important time for us to continue building our shared future. This Resilient Greater Christchurch Plan is a key part of that future. Earthquakes may have been our disrupted past, but our bright future will still hold surprises for us. Building a truly resilient Greater Christchurch will create a future where we and our children and their children can thrive in spite of multiple hazards and significant uncertainty. Christchurch, before the earthquakes, was one of the world's truly great small cities and the gateway to the Greater Christchurch and Canterbury region. I believe the Christchurch we are co-creating will be at least twice as good as the old Christchurch! It will be different, as we see the rebuild of our region taking shape, but a \u2018different' that is filled with potential, engagement and shared vibrancy.\nThis plan is not simply about our built and economic environments, but equally about our human and social environments, about our natural and hazard\nenvironments. Many of the themes and concepts incorporated in this Resilient\nGreater Christchurch Plan are captured in core Ngai Tahu cultural values, including whanaungatanga (close community relationships), kaitiakitanga (stewardship of our natural environment) and tohungatanga (building a learning culture). It is such holistic thinking that will make the difference in building more resilient people, organisations, ecologies and communities.\nThis Resilient Greater Christchurch Plan is a product of a two year process that has involved hundreds of community members from diverse backgrounds and cultures. They have been from across our region, including key partners: Waimakariri District, Selwyn District and Christchurch City councils, Environment Canterbury, Ngai Tahu, NZ Transport Agency and Canterbury District Health Board, as well as our tertiary institutions and Crown Research Institutes. We will all benefit from a more resilient city and surrounding towns and districts. In light of this shared benefit and shared future, I invite you to join in a shared endeavour to build a more resilient, thriving and equitable place to live, learn, work and play.\nAs Chair of the Resilience Plan Advisory Group and with the support of that Advisory Group, I endorse this resilience plan. This is not a static document but part of a shared resilience journey. An uncertain future requires an adaptable plan and process and that is what we have in this resilience plan.\nDr John Vargo\nCo-leader, Resilient Organisation Research Programme Chair, Advisory Group for the Resilient Greater Christchurch Plan\nHISTORY OF SETTLEMENT IN GREATER CHRISTCHURCH\nThe \u2018Black Map' - prepared\nby British Surveyors around 1850 - shows that much of Christchurch was\nwaterways and wetlands covered with harakeke (flax) and raupo.\nLocated between the fertile Canterbury Plains and the coast, overlooked by the Port Hills, Greater Christchurch has long been an attractive place to live, work and play.\nMaori have inhabited this area for over 40 generations (c. 800-1000 years) attracted by the abundant natural resources. Today, Ngai Tahu express their resilience through a strong entrepreneurial spirit, a keen sense of whanau, and an ongoing recognition of the essential relationship between land, water and people.\nThe \u2018Black Map' - prepared by British Surveyors around 1850 - shows that much of Christchurch was waterways and wetlands covered with harakeke (flax) and raupo. Since 1850, most of the wetlands have been drained and cleared as Christchurch City has grown.\nEuropean settlement in Canterbury dates from the 1830s with whaling stations being established on Banks Peninsula\/Te Pataka o Rakaihautu. In the mid-i800s, the Canterbury Association commenced formal colonisation including the founding of Christchurch\/Otautahi as the primary settlement.\nChristchurch and surrounding towns have grown over the past 150 years primarily on the back of the agricultural use of the Canterbury Plains.\nGreater Christchurch today\nChristchurch is the largest urban area in Greater Christchurch surrounded by\nseveral smaller settlements which also serve rural areas.\nToday, agriculture, food processing and associated engineering remain core to\nthe local economy. Engineering, technology and research-based industries have\ngrown in their importance to the economy in the past few decades, drawing on the strength of tertiary education opportunities provided through the University of Canterbury, Lincoln University and the Ara Institute of Canterbury.\nInternational connections and trade remain important, underlined by the fact that tourism has recently eclipsed agriculture as our largest source of overseas income. Advances in commercial aviation since the 1960s dramatically reduced Greater\nChristchurch's geographical isolation and allowed it to emerge as an international tourism destination and gateway to the scenic attractions of the South Island.\nOUR SHOCKS AND STRESSES\nBeing resilient relies on understanding, preparing, coping and adapting to the\nthreats we face. There are two broad categories:\n\u2022 Acute shocks are sudden, sharp events that threaten us. The Canterbury earthquakes represent one of the most significant types of shock any place can endure.\n\u2022 Chronic stresses weaken the fabric and functioning of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis.\nEarthquakes, pandemics, flooding, coastal erosion, storm surge, wind and tsunamis are the most significant shocks that are likely to occur in Greater Christchurch.\nChronic stresses for Greater Christchurch include climate change, affordable\nquality housing, psychosocial wellbeing and an aging population.\nSHOCKS\nSeismicity\nThe most recent earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 emerged from a little known and localised series of faults extending along an east-west axis across the\nSouth Island. However, the much larger Alpine Fault, which extends down the spine of the South Inland, is our primary seismic threat. Experts believe there is roughly a 30% to 65% chance that there could be a magnitude 8.0 earthquake on this fault in the next 50 years.\nFlooding\nFlooding is the most common hazard\nto effect our communities. Localised\nsurface water flooding occurs regularly following intense or prolonged rainfall events. Ground subsidence caused by the recent earthquakes has elevated the severity and frequency of flooding events.\nAt a larger scale, much of Greater\nChristchurch sits on a floodplain.\nMajor defences protect communities\nfrom catastrophic flooding by the\nWaimakariri River, but in the future it\nis likely to be coastal flooding, storm\nsurges and inundation that are the\ngreater threat.\nTsunami\nSeismic activity around the fringes\nof the Pacific represents constant\npotential to generate tsunami. Our\nlow-lying and flat coastal areas leave\nus exposed to this threat. Of greatest threat are distant source tsunami, particularly those resulting from underwater mass movement in the deep oceanic trench that runs parallel to the Chilean coast of South America.\nSTRESSES\nClimate Change\nThe Canterbury Earthquake Sequence has informed our conversation about resilience, but has not defined it. Preparing for climate change was already underway before 2010 and 2011 and its impacts on our region will be significant. Warmer temperatures year round will extend growing seasons but may bring more frequent droughts and fire risks. Fewer, but more intense rainfall events, will increase flood risks but also limit the amount of groundwater and soil moisture capture. Within our major rivers, lower flows will reduce the amount of sediment carried downstream and deposited along the coast to replace that being eroded by rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges. Beyond these threats, pests and diseases endemic in sub-tropical latitudes may become established in our region requiring new responses.\nGlobalisation\nJust as we are susceptible to powerful forces of nature, we are also susceptible to the forces of global markets. Greater Christchurch's normal economic activity is currently swollen by the NZ$40 billion (2015) of earthquake reconstruction funding that will extend into the 2020s.\nLeaving that aside, the externally-facing economy that draws income and prosperity into Greater Christchurch is highly geared towards agriculture and tourism. In both of these areas we have clear strengths (modern efficient farming production with high quality outputs and unrivalled scenic and cultural visitor experiences) but face threats and competition from other parts of the world.\nDemographics\nLike many developed countries globally, our population and workforce are aging. The large number of people born in the years following the Second World War (baby boomers) are now entering retirement age.\nThis age group represents a growing consumer opportunity but will place pressure on social systems including health, social care and state pensions. The loss of this age group will also see a loss of knowledge and skills in the economy, although this may be harnessed by community level action and participation. Over recent decades natural population replacement has not kept up, relying on inflows of skilled migrant labour to fill particular types of employment.\nHealth\nAs summarised in the 2016 Urban Development Strategy Update, life expectancy is increasing across Greater Christchurch. Along with it comes more chronic health conditions including Type Two diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and dementia. Being obese, overweight or inactive is also a cause of chronic conditions. In 2014, New Zealand was second only to the United States in its measures of childhood obesity.\nIn the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes, psychosocial wellbeing has emerged as a significant longterm threat to health. The trauma of the earthquakes combined with social upheavals through moving homes and schools has particularly affected children and young people. More widely, the stress of resolving insurance settlements, being dislocated from family or community networks and the everyday experience of living in a recovering city are all taking their toll on people.\nHousing and\nSocial Equity\nLoss and damage to homes as a result of the 2011 earthquake drove up rental prices, left people sleeping in garages and cars and contributed to an exodus of people from the region. It took major releases of land and rapid investment in housing over 4 years to resolve these effects.\nHowever, pre-earthquake housing stresses remain. The gap between average incomes and average house prices has steadily grown since the mid 1990s leaving a generation of younger people forced to rent rather than own their homes. Compounding this problem a substantial part of the rental housing stock, including state houses, have seen little improvement with a lack insulation and basic heating being common with consequent cost and health implications for poorer households.\nThe lack of access to decent affordable housing is symptomatic of a wider social divide we face. Low income households are forced to accept poorer quality housing, are less able to afford healthy nutritious food and in turn endure poorer health. They are also disproportionately affected by sudden shocks and events. Inequality emerges for a range of reasons and so the responses we make must be grounded in equity - tailoring action and support to specific needs and situations.\nMore information about our Shocks and Stresses and the interrelationships between them can be explored further in our Focus Area\nReports, specifically Focus Area Report\n3: Understanding and Responding to Future Challenges which can be downloaded from our web page.\nTHE DIVIDEND OF RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE\nIn 1997, Risks and Realities:\nA multi-disciplinary approach to the vulnerability of lifelines to natural\nhazards in metropolitan Christchurch\nwas developed by the Christchurch Engineering Lifelines Group. This approach was applied to infrastructure planning to provide for risk reduction and reinstatement of infrastructure following natural disasters. Although the Canterbury earthquakes caused widespread damage, our roads, rail, sea ports, airports, water networks, electricity, gas and telecommunications networks have proven to be resilient. This meant that in the hours and days following the earthquakes, most power, water and communication\nservices as well as air, road and rail travel were able to function, ensuring that the basic needs of residents were met. Within Greater Christchurch there is a high degree of understanding of the resilience of infrastructure to earthquakes, but less understanding of resilience to other shocks like major distant tsunami.\nThe rebuild of Christchurch's earthquake-damaged roads and underground pipes is being carried out with a view to the future resilience of the network. In addition, the city's grid-style water supply network, which does not rely on one main trunk pipe, adds to infrastructure resilience.\nResilience is also considered in the 30-year strategies that each territorial authority is required to prepare to identify significant infrastructure issues and the principal options for managing them.\nThe Natural Environment Recovery Programme for Greater Christchurch: Whakaara Taiao (2013) identifies ways to rehabilitate and improve the natural environment through the rebuild, and how opportunities could be taken. The programme aimed to make continuing and incremental improvements to the pre-earthquake state of the natural environment, with no further degradation.\nEarthquakes and insurance\nNew Zealanders generally hold a high level of private insurance which reduces the financial impact of acute shocks.\nThe Earthquake Commission (EQC) provides coverage for the first tranche of damage. EQC is an entity of the New Zealand Government. Its core functions include providing a natural disaster insurance for residential property, administering a natural disaster fund and funding research and education on natural disasters. All private insurance policies for home and contents include EQC cover for loss and damage from earthquakes, natural landslip, volcanic eruption, tsunami, flood and storm damage. Private insurance covers damage above the EQC legislated threshold.\nIn Canterbury, there was a high rate of insurance coverage compared with coverage for earthquakes in countries such as Japan, Chile and America. Five years after the earthquakes, some insurance claims are still to be settled. According to the NZ Treasury's February 2016 Bulletin, by 30 September 2015 insurers had paid out $26 billion.\nAs a result of the Canterbury earthquakes insurance companies have changed the way they offer residential insurance policies, from full-replacement to sum insured. This has contributed to increased cost of insurance. The EQC Natural Disaster Fund has been almost exhausted in responding to the earthquakes. This may result in a higher cost borne by the government for any future disaster until the fund is replenished.\nNational conversation on resilience\nAs a small nation of about 4.6 million people New Zealanders are interdependent economically, socially and culturally. We share a number of challenges as a nation and resilience is a conversation that is going on at a national level. There are a number of initiatives that are currently underway to build resilience at a national level, including:\n\u2022\tThe National Science Challenges are Central Government initiatives to focus science investment to tackle the biggest science-based challenges New Zealand faces. They provide opportunities for collaboration between research institutions, business and non-government organisations.\n\u2022\tThe Natural Hazards Research Platform is a multi-party research platform dedicated to increasing New Zealand's resilience to natural hazards via high-quality collaborative research.\nHOW WE DEVELOPED THIS PLAN\nloo Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation\n(100RC) is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks - earthquakes, fires, floods, etc. - but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis. Examples of these stresses include high unemployment; an overtaxed or inefficient public transportation system; endemic violence; or chronic food and water shortages.\nBy addressing both our shocks and the stresses, we will be better able to respond to adverse events, and overall better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.\nThe first phase, starting in December 2014, was a consultative scoping exercise involving a broad range of stakeholder organisations. Workshop sessions explored the shocks and stresses facing Greater Christchurch, the experiences from the Canterbury earthquakes and the priorities to improve the future resilience of Greater Christchurch communities. The resulting Preliminary Resilience Assessment, published September 2015, identified eight resilience challenges and opportunities on which to concentrate.\nPhase 2 - the development of this plan - is founded on four Focus Areas identified during the Preliminary Resilience Assessment. Project teams were set up for each of the four Focus Areas, led by individuals with subject expertise from the Canterbury District Health Board, Canterbury Development Corporation,\nCivil Defence and Emergency Management\/NZ Transport Agency (jointly) and Christchurch City Council. Reports produced by each Focus Area team identified key issues, responses and identified actions related to the eight challenges and opportunities.\nA long list of over 150 actions emerged from the Focus Area reports. Actions included current initiatives with the potential to be expanded, projects in the planning stage and other actions that could be developed further. This long list was subjected to a multi-criteria evaluation, with filters including specific benefits to vulnerable groups, applicability across Greater Christchurch, resilience dividends (i.e. multiple benefits from programmes) and resilience qualities. A shortlist of around 70 actions emerged from this evaluation.\nThe Focus Area reports and shortlisted actions were used to develop the direction of this plan. Content, concepts and emergent programmes of action were further explored through working groups, meetings and workshops with the Focus Area leaders and four key influencers who are profiled on the following pages.\nThe outcome of these discussions was the production of a draft plan in May 2016 which was presented to all the participants in the process for feedback prior to this plan - Resilient Greater Christchurch - being finalised and formally ratified by Christchurch City, Selwyn District and Waimakariri District councils and Environment Canterbury in July\/August 2016.\nKEY INFLUENCERS IN SHAPING\nTHIS PLAN\nDeveloping the Plan was a collaborative and shared journey involving community groups, the business sector, institutions and academics. To draw together the views from these interests, and to reflect different perspectives, the following key influencers have played a significant role in shaping the final content of this plan:\n\u2022\tNgai Tahu\n\u2022\tGreater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy Partnership\n\u2022\tResilience Advisory Group\n\u2022\t100 Resilient Cities\nNgai Tahu\nNgai Tahu is the largest tribe (iwi) in the South Island comprised of a number of related sub-tribes (hapu) and extended families (whanau).\nIn 1840, Ngai Tahu leaders signed Te Tiriti o Waitangi (The Treaty of Waitangi).\nIn 1849, Tiramorehu wrote a petition to Queen Victoria. The petition was signed by all the leading Ngai Tahu chiefs of the time. They asked that the Crown put aside\nadequate reserves of land for the iwi, as agreed to under the terms of its land\npurchases. In the 20 years from 1844, Ngai Tahu signed land sale contracts with the Crown for some 34.5 million acres, approximately 80% of the South Island,\nTe Waipounamu. The Crown failed to allocate one-tenth of the land to the iwi, nor\ndid it pay a fair price, as it agreed. Following this, Ngai Tahu devoted their lives in\nthe pursuit of justice to Te Kereme (the claim) to seek redress from the Crown for\nover seven generations, and in 1986 filed Wai 27 to the Waitangi Tribunal. After years of negotiations, Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu Act 1996 was passed in Parliament, followed by the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998 recognising the injustices to the Ngai Tahu people and formalising the relationship between the Crown and Ngai Tahu as Treaty partners in a new post-settlement era.\nToday, Ngai Tahu communities (hapu and whanau) are represented by 18 regional councils (papatipu runanga) and one tribal authority (Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu). Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu (TRONT) has statutory responsibility to manage collectively-held tribal assets and protect tribal interests, while regional runanga are responsible for local interests. Collectively, all Papatipu Runanga have responsibility to honour the deeds and values of Ngai Tahu ancestors and to create an inheritance for future generations. This includes traditional responsibilities to manage our environment sustainably in order to protect and enhance mahinga kai values and socio-economic capital.\nEngagement with Papatipu runanga in preparing this plan led to some important modifications.\n\u2022\tThe first was in response to the fundamental Maori worldview that people\nare intrinsically related to their environment, and that resilient communities are built on resilient ecosystems.\n\u2022\tThe second is the wider adoption of the concept of whanau as the primary\nbuilding block of Maori society and centre of its strength.\n\u2022\tFinally, the importance of establishing and maintaining strong relationships\nbetween Treaty Partners was highlighted as the means by which the two aforementioned elements will best be recognised and provided for during the\nimplementation of this plan.\nThe core cultural values and principles (tikanga) set out on the opposite page have\nbeen integrated throughout this Plan to guide and support its goals, programmes\nand actions.\nThe UDS Partnership is made up of the three territorial authorities (Christchurch City, Selwyn and\nWaimakiriri Districts), the Canterbury\nregional council, and local Maori leadership (Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu).\nIt is supported by the New Zealand Transport Agency, the Canterbury District Health Board and, from 2016, Regenerate Christchurch (a Government\/City Council regeneration partnership). The Group also maintains dialogue with Central Government through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's Greater Christchurch Group.\nThe Resilience Advisory Group was\nchaired by Dr John Vargo, co-leader of the Resilient Organisations social enterprise. Membership of the group includes individuals from Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, Canterbury University, Massey University, Aviva, Canterbury Youth Worker Collective, Avon-Otakaro Network, Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu and Environment Canterbury.\nGreater Christchurch\nUrban Development Strategy Partnership\nThe Urban Development Strategy partnership was established in 2004 to address the challenges posed by the urban growth demands of Greater Christchurch, including co-ordinated transport and infrastructure delivery and the need for collaborative sub-regional leadership in the face of market-driven urban sprawl. Wide public engagement and joint working culminated in the publication of the Urban Development Strategy in 2007.\nOne of its guiding principles is resilience \u2014 defined then as \u201cmanaging risk\nand uncertainty through strategy and implementation frameworks that\nenhance how individuals, communities and organisations respond to hazards and the unexpected\u201d. This principle, alongside six others, continues to help the partnership frame its debates and discussions about future growth management.\nFollowing the Canterbury Earthquake Sequence, the Urban Development Strategy partnership became the key reference body to guide the use of statutory powers granted under the 2011 Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act. The Urban Development Strategy itself provided a ready-made, long-term strategic land use framework which was used by the government to guide earthquake recovery. The Partnership and its Strategy have been critical to shaping recovery of our communities and have demonstrated collaborative leadership that is both visionary and practical.\nA key strand of the Partners' input has been the emphasis placed on strong relationships across different parts of government (central, regional and local) and with local tribal leaders (Nga Papatipu Rununga). The direction is that these must be cornerstones for strategic resilience-building in Greater Christchurch.\nResilience Advisory Group\nThe Resilience Advisory Group was commissioned to provide subject matter guidance, process review input and to identify interdependencies and opportunities for collaboration across the range of initiatives identified in the emerging Resilient Greater Christchurch Plan. Central to its role was the requirement that it provide input into the plan and be available for discussion and feedback.\nA key driver for this group was making the plan a living document - a plan with a clear direction, but not so rigid as to become irrelevant after a short while.\n100 Resilient Cities\npioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation\nThe guidance and international best practice being gathered by 100RC and the experiences of other cities in the 100RC network has helped to shape this plan. The City Resilience Framework (page 35) helped us to develop our Stage 1 Preliminary Resilience Assessment, particularly in determining our challenges and opportunities. Sharing of experiences with other cities in the network and the ability to leverage international insights and expertise has also enhanced the development of this plan.\nAs the remaining city strategies are released, Greater Christchurch will continue to learn from other cities and lend them support. An important resource to assist in this is the access to the 100RC Platform Partners - non-governmental organisations, businesses and consultancies - which provide a global resource of resilience building tools and services. As we advance into the implementation stages of this plan there is the ability to use services like those showcased below to help us deliver action towards our goals.\nTrimble provides geospatial technical solutions and domain to capture, measure, analyze, monitor, and share built and environmental information to help accomplish a City's resiliency goals and objectives.\nhttp:\/\/www.ecognition.com\/essentials\nThe Streetwyze app helps cities integrate community-generated data with predictive analytics they can track equity indicators, identify hot spots for equitable development, and predict future trajectories for vulnerable populations. http:\/\/www.streetwyze.com\/\nThe Nature Conservancy (TNC) provides cities with software tools and technical assistance to facilitate a standardized, science-based approach to watershed, coastal hazard, and ecosystem management, including visualization, forecasting, and investment portfolio design.\nhttp:\/\/coastalresilience.org\/\nSwiss Re provides cities a natural hazard web tool, CatNet, which helps determine what types of hazards a city faces, and how often and how badly the city might be affected.\nhttp:\/\/www.swissre.com\/clients\/client_tools\/about_catnet.html\nOUR RESILIENCE CHALLENGES\nThe Preliminary Resilience Assessment identified nine interconnected resilience challenges. The following summaries distil these challenges and set the foundations for this plan. The icons introduced here are used later in this plan to link our actions to these challenges.\nCommunity and\nsocial cohesion\nBuilding and supporting community\nnetworks is key to our resilience.\nThe earthquakes resulted in disruption to many existing communities and has seen a large increase in international migration as people come to Canterbury to take part in the rebuild. International migration to the Canterbury region has been steadily increasing since February 2011. Monthly net migration into the city has now been positive for 32 months in a row and that annual inflow is the highest level since at least 1991. Net migration into the wider Canterbury region is also at a record high. Of these new migrants, Canterbury's Employers' Chamber of Commerce has reported that the largest group is likely to be from the Philippines. The region needs to embrace this diversity, integrate the new workforce into the wider community and encourage new residents to remain once the rebuild winds down.\nSecuring our future\nin the eastern parts\nof Christchurch\nChristchurch's eastern suburbs were severely affected by the earthquakes, with widespread liquefaction and land damage resulting in the creation of a \u201cred zone\u201d where 8,000 homes were demolished. The east is also home\nto some of the city's most socially\nand economically disadvantaged\ncommunities. The future challenge is to ensure community voices are heard and considered as significant land use and natural hazard planning decisions are made.\nUnderstanding risks\nand tools for mitigation\nChristchurch has always been at risk\nfrom hazards like earthquake, land\nslip, flooding, tsunami and pandemic.\nThe earthquakes improved our\nunderstanding of some, but questions still remain on how we assess the risks and mitigate against them.\nThese issues, and the consequent role of insurance in a post-earthquake environment, must be considered at all levels of community. Insurance as a tool has helped the resilience of Christchurch by enabling much of the rebuild, but is facing challenges, for example higher excesses and premiums in areas of high risk (especially\nflooding) and the new requirement\nfor households to nominate a sum\ninsured. Ensuring government, the\nprivate sector and local communities\nunderstand the issues is essential to\nengaging them in the decision-making process.\nToitu te marae o Tane Healthy Lands\nToitu te marae o Tangaroa Healthy Waters\nToitu te iwi\nHealthy Communities\nTribal statement of identity\nHousing affordability and accessibility\nHouse prices and rents have become more affordable in recent months because of growing incomes and housing stock numbers returning to pre-quake levels, bringing welcome news to renters and first home buyers. For example improved availability of housing and reduced demand from displaced households continues to push rents downward. Private sector mean rents in Christchurch were $400 in March 2016, 4.7 percent lower than March 2015. Annual rent growth has remained negative in 2016, signalling a correction following strong rent growth in the 2012-14 period. However access to affordable, good quality, warm and healthy housing has always been an issue for the people of Christchurch. Damage and displacement caused by the earthquakes exacerbated the problem: around 16,000 properties were severely damaged and the number of people facing extreme housing deprivation has increased between 70 and 112 per cent since the earthquakes. Ensuring access to quality housing is important to future resilience.\nUrban form of\nGreater Christchurch\nChristchurch has a unique opportunity to rebuild better: for its urban form to reflect the needs and aspirations of the community. The city faces a growing population and changing demographic, significant residential redevelopment, and increased housing demand due to a reduction in the housing stock and immigration to support the rebuild. The population of Greater Christchurch grew from 414,000 in 2006 to 428,000 in 2013 and based on a medium growth projection is expected to rise to increase to 566,900 people in 2043. Effective urban planning could help mitigate future stresses such as homelessness, unemployment, traffic congestion, accessibility to services and environmental pressure.\nThe role of innovation\nTo stay competitive businesses need to innovate and workers need to develop skills to change and adopt new technology. In New Zealand in 2015, on average, innovating businesses made nearly twice as much annual profit ($3m) as non-innovating businesses ($1.6m); employed twice as many people as a non-innovating firms and made more profit per staff member.\nGreater Christchurch is well positioned in terms of the education and training infrastructure. The area has a high quality supporting institutions such as 149 primary and secondary schools; three university campuses and a polytechnic; seven Crown Research Institutes; two Centres of Excellence and a solid core of high tech manufacturing and knowledge intensive service businesses. This is a good position from which to provide innovative education and training, and to continue to build an institutional framework that supports innovation and future competitiveness.\nUnderstanding the specific impact of the technological changes on the Greater Christchurch community and economy, and then developing co-ordinated actions and growing the innovation ecosystem, are projects noted in the Actions section. Supporting innovation and using new technology to enhance innovation, will create new opportunities and make the region attractive to young people and migrants.\nCommunity leadership\nWidespread community-based responses played an important role in supporting Greater Christchurch immediately following the 2010\/2011 Canterbury earthquakes and during the ensuing period of recovery. Responses included informal, spontaneous efforts and organised responses led by the community and iwi organisations. Most organised responses were initiated by existing community groups or leaders, with some new initiatives and leaders emerging, such as the youth-led Student Volunteer Army. The act of contributing is key to a community's resilience, however initiatives like this need ongoing support to survive. Maintaining and building this culture of community response and connectedness is important for Christchurch. A key challenge for Greater Christchurch will be to maintain and broaden the \u2018culture of possibility'.\nBuilding trust between the community and\ndecision makers\nResidents want to be involved in the decisions that affect their neighbourhoods and communities. Concerns were raised about centralised decision-making processes immediately following the earthquakes and through the recovery. Now that both central and local government roles are changing, the shift in focus to regeneration offers an opportunity for a more deliberative and collaborative approach to decision-making. Community leaders in Christchurch commented that in the months after the earthquakes, the connections between organisations strengthened and new collaborations emerged. Communities felt positive and energised by the collaborative \u2018new normal' but special effort is required to maintain collaboration to a high standard.\nExperiences from other disasters have indicated that recovery solutions should be multi-disciplinary and that there should be clear links between technological solutions and social solutions. Greater Christchurch can practice a multi-disciplinary approach in engagement with people and communities and can also advocate for the community in work with agencies.\nConnection with our natural environment\nNgai Tahu recognises that all things are interconnected and that the symbiotic relationship between land, water and people is at the heart of building resilient communities. The development of Greater Christchurch has impacted the health of land and water, particularly through the draining of wetlands and degradation of waterways which has seen extensive loss of biodiversity. Post-earthquake regeneration offers an opportunity to improve the vitality and resilience of our waterways and surrounding landscapes.\nOUR APPROACH\nFrom the outset of the preparation of this plan we have used the City Resilience Framework* as a tool to help us define what resilience means for Greater Christchurch. The framework, developed by Arup and The Rockefeller Foundation, is made up of four dimensions\u2014Health & Wellbeing, Economy & Society, Infrastructure & Environment, and Leadership & Strategy\u2014and is further defined by 12 drivers of resilience. We used the framework throughout the process to assess the connections between our challenges, identify critical areas of strength and weakness, and facilitate a comprehensive discussion of resilience with our stakeholders.\nIn consultation with our key influencers, we developed a more locally specific framework to embed resilience in our community through our goals, programmes and actions. The success of this plan relies on the ability to facilitate, promote and maintain connections between people and increase understanding and acceptance of our interdependency at all levels to build people's capacity to be resilient.\nBy using this approach to evaluate and set priorities,\nGreater Christchurch will achieve the Resilience\nDividend: Instead of investing to reduce\nimpacts from a single hazard or improve\na single metric, the city will make\nstrategic decisions to improve\nits overall strength and endure\nmultiple shocks and stresses.\nInvesting in resilience can\nsave money, save lives, and\nbuild a more equitable and\nprosperous city.\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN\nTO BE RESILIENT IN GREATER CHRISTCHURCH?\nThere are many definitions and meanings of resilience and over the past few\nyears definitions of what it means to be resilient have been tested, reinforced or changed.\nManaging risk and uncertainty through strategy and implementation frameworks that\nenhance how individuals, communities and organisations respond to hazards and the unexpected.\nDefinition from the 2007 GREATER CHRISTCHURCH URBAN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY\nA community is not the co-location of houses - that's a suburb. Leadership is not a position you hold - it is a mark of your character. And resilience is not being strong in the face of adversity - that is stoicism. Resilience is about the capacity to plan and prepare for adversity, the ability to absorb the impact and recover quickly, but more importantly it's about the ability as a community to adapt to a new environment, to thrive in the face of adversity and co-create our new normal...\nLIANNE DALZIEL Christchurch Mayor\nThe capacity of individuals, communities, businesses and systems to survive, adapt and grow, no\nmatter what chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\n100 RESILIENT CITIES\nFor local Ngai Tahu, resilience is about maintaining connections between people, place and culture in a way that feeds mind, body and soul. It is inter-generational and promoted by three primary objectives:\n\u2022\tsustaining the vitality of our natural environment\n\u2022\tfostering stronger whanau\n\u2022\tbuilding meaningful Treaty partnerships with civic leaders.\nThis plan contains actions that support the delivery of the Urban Development Strategy Partnership Vision for Greater Christchurch set out in the Foreword of this document. That vision was underpinned by seven guiding principles Leadership, Partnership, Innovation, Integration, Regeneration, Equity and Resilience. The goals and programmes contained within this plan will encourage wider strategic thinking about resilience when the Urban Development Strategy is fully reviewed in coming years.\nWe are resilient\nThis plan places people at the heart of a Resilient Greater Christchurch. When people are supported by whanau, communities and organisations, collectively we form a more resilient Greater Christchurch. For this reason, throughout this plan the term \u2018we' is used widely and is intended to be inclusive as we all have roles to play in resilience building.\nThe success of this plan relies on the ability to facilitate, promote and maintain connections between people, and increase understanding and acceptance of our interdependency at all levels, to build people's capacity to be resilient. The icons introduced below are used later in this plan. They link our actions to our actors.\nORGANISATIONS All organisations have the capacity and capability to be effective agents of change to drive adaptation and continue to thrive.\nCOMMUNITIES As communities we support, foster, include and connect people so they are able to participate, respond and adapt.\nWHANAU As whanau we respect, support,\nfoster and maintain relationships with each\nother, our environment, hapu and iwi.\nINDIVIDUALS\/HOUSEHOLDS\nAs individuals and households we connect with our friends and family, whanau, neighbours and communities.\nWHANAU\nis a Maori term which can loosely be translated to mean extended family.\nIn the strict sense, Maori use this term to define those related by whakapapa (genealogical ties). However, in today's ever-changing world (te ao hurihuri), the term \u2018whanau' is often applied to other closely-connected groups of people, the members of which work for the collective benefit of the whole. This is an important nuance within the context of this plan, which recognises that in times of need it is our ability to work together for the greater good to withstand, bounce back from, or adapt to shocks and stresses.\nCOMMUNITIES\nin the context of this plan, takes the broadest meaning. It includes groups of people living or working in the same geographic area, such as a neighbourhood or suburb, and a group of people who have common interests, attitudes, business or socioeconomic characteristics. In working with this plan, you are encouraged to think inclusively about the different communities you belong to and what contributions each can make to resilience.\nORGANISATIONS\nrefers to all forms of organisation including Central Government, councils, iwi, businesses, schools, colleges and universities, charities and non-governmental bodies, churches and sports clubs.\nOUR PLAN\nThe rest of this document sets out our plan, the things we intend to do to continue\nbuilding resilince across Greater Christchurch. The plan is structured as follows:\nOur Guiding Principles\nTwo guiding principles that cut across our goals. \u2018Cross-cutting' in nature, they are symbolically wrapped around the adjacent diagram reflecting that they should be implicit to a greater or lesser degree in each programme. The principles emerged from background work and dialogue with our Key Influencers.\nFundamentally they reflect, firstly that Greater Christchurch needs to honour the bi-cultural governance arrangements agreed between Maori and European\nSettlers in the mid 1800s, and secondly, reflecting our experience since 2011, that\nernment at all levels need to work closer together.\nThe Guiding Principles are explored further on the following pages.\nOur Resilience Goals\nWe have set four goals - Connect, Participate, Prosper and Understand - to help us structure our activity towards\nextending the resilience of Greater Christchurch. Each is framed around building capacity in our people, places, organisations and systems so we have confidence to face our challenges.\nOur Resilience Programmes\nEach goal contains a series of programmes which are the building blocks for improving our resilience. Collectively all 11 programmes will strengthen our capacity to adapt and\nthrive in an uncertain future. The adjacent diagram illustrates this inter-connectivity highlighting that while programmes are\nassigned to a particular goal, they also contribute to, and align with other goals. This structure recognises the interconnected,\ncomplex nature of our challenges and encourages holistic, integrated and collaborative solutions.\nOur Resilience Actions\nUnder each of the 11 programmes are action areas which outline what this plan proposes to do to tackle the challenges described at a programme level, and the outcomes we can expect. The action areas list out aligned projects or initiatives that have recently been delivered and confirmed projects.\nHowever, the bulk of activity is contained within the implementation plan that sits towards the end of this plan. It contains a further 50 or so actions that local groups, voluntary organisations, business and governmental organisations have identified and will be committing resources to. This part of the plan will continue to evolve year on year as new ideas emerge.\nOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES\nA meaningful Treaty partnership with Ngai Tahu\nWhy is this principle critical to resilience in Greater Christchurch?\nThe expression of Treaty Partnerships took a significant step forward following the enactment\nof the Canterbury Earthquake\nRecovery Act 2011. Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu was recognised as a statutory partner alongside local and central government agencies, and invited to participate in all decisions relating to the recovery of Greater Christchurch governed by the Act. Such recognition and provision for Treaty partnership was unprecedented and has allowed each partner to understand each other better and make more meaningful decisions. This has confirmed a strong treaty partnership and examples of meaningful collaboration have resulted in positive outcomes for the Crown, Ngai Tahu and the wider community.\nThe treaty is a partnership between Maori and the Crown, which requires the partners to act toward each other \u2018reasonably and with the utmost good faith'. \u2014 1991 Waitangi Tribunal (Ngai Tahu Report)\nThis principle acknowledges the mana (influence, prestige, authority, control) of both Ngai Tahu and the Crown whose respective leaders signed Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Maori language text) in 1840. They agreed to live together, the Crown taking responsibility for European settlers (kawanatanga), Ngai Tahu communities (hapu) retaining their own autonomy (tino rangatiratanga). Incongruities across the two language versions of the Treaty gave rise to different interpretations and led ultimately to the enunciation of a series of Treaty Principles by the Waitangi Tribunal, Courts and Government in the last quarter of the 20th Century.\nThe principles focus on the broad sentiments, intentions and goals of the Treaty, not its words. The treaty partnership was expressed within the Ngai Tahu Deed of Settlement and subsequently the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998 formalising the relationship between the Crown and Ngai Tahu as Treaty Partners. They include the principle of partnership and good faith which the Resilient Greater Christchurch Plan seeks to honour and give effect to.\nWhat we will be doing?\nBuilding on this, government agencies and councils will develop and enhance their existing relationships with local Papatipu Runanga. Through regular formal engagement between respective governors, annual programmes of action can be developed, prioritised and implemented in collaboration with Ngai Tahu whanau and Papatipu Runanga.\nWhat resilience value will this principle contribute?\nThe resilience value is in building a more inclusive and genuinely bi-cultural set of governance arrangements. This will lead to more meaningful and collaborative decisions and resilience building activities for Greater Christchurch.\nConsistency and collaboration across all tiers of government\nWhy is this principle critical to resilience in Greater Christchurch?\nGovernment agencies, public organisations and iwi leaders at the local, regional and national level have a role to play in building and delivering a Resilient Greater Christchurch. They are interdependent and it is critical that there is consistency of understanding of the issues involved, as well as collaboration in policy formulation, investment and activity.\nWhat we will be doing?\nKey pillars of consistency and collaboration are developing a common base of evidence and understanding, and the use of effective and positive relationships between agencies to find solutions that reflect specific local conditions. Beyond these, it is about taking opportunities to manage resources effectively, avoiding duplication and delivering in a cost-effective manner; making use of regulation as lightly, but as robustly as is needed to drive change or compliance; and most of all, furthering the health and prosperity of Greater Christchurch.\nWhat resilience value will this principle contribute?\nWithin the New Zealand context, Greater Christchurch has many lessons to share from its earthquake experiences and a unique perspective on resilience. Often, the most powerful policy directives are mandated at a Central Government level. For this reason it is important that the affected councils co-ordinate efforts to share knowledge and insights. Collaboration and consistency plays a critical role in advancing the long-term integrated planning and initiatives that will ensure we are better prepared for the future.\nAlongside the Greater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy Partnership, the Canterbury Natural Hazard Risk Reduction Group is another example of collaboration. Formed in 2016, its role is to develop and implement a regional approach to managing natural hazard risk across the Canterbury region. The Group is a collaborative approach across all councils and Civil Defence Emergency Management. The Group reports into the governance structures for both the Canterbury Civil Defence Emergency Management Group Joint Committee and the Canterbury Mayoral Forum.\nWE ARE CONNECTED COMMUNITIES LIVING IN ADAPTABLE PLACES\nWhy this goal is important to resilience in Greater Christchurch\nConnections between people and the places they live create a sense of community. They are also critical components of resilience.\nGreater Christchurch has strong communities but the earthquakes caused change. Some people were forced to move away from earthquake-damaged areas, and others used the repair of earthquake damaged homes as an opportunity to sell and relocate. There has also been a large inflow of migrants to take up work in Greater Christchurch to help rebuild the city.\nThe change has disrupted many community connections, and in growth areas\nhas created new communities where networks between people need to be\ncreated. Without focus on whanaungatanga, or community building, we fail to learn from our post-earthquake experience. It was the power of people, through manaakitanga, that enabled us to cope and recover. Knowing our neighbours, having recognisable and accessible local leaders, and having people to turn to are critical to the resilience of our communities.\nKaitiakitanga emphasises that we must nurture the places we live in, as much as we nurture the relationships between people. Under this goal is the need to ensure our urban environments are inclusive and adaptable.\nThe availability of safe, communal places and spaces where people can meet is at the heart of a community and of turangawaewae. These places are a place to create memories, foster connections with people and generate a sense of belonging. More widely, the ability of our neighbourhoods to satisfy our needs is at the heart of resilience. Within parts of Greater Christchurch, local communities lack convenient access to local facilities, including sources of nutritious food, while in others people do not feel safe in their neighbourhoods.\nAffordable, quality housing is also at the heart of community needs. One of the most chronic stresses present across Greater Christchurch is the lack of affordable and quality housing. Average incomes fall short of what households can afford to pay for housing, whilst the quality of rental housing can affect people's health. Taking positive steps to improve the quality of our housing stock and to encourage the development of the types and sizes of homes we need is a positive investment in a resilient future.\nIn addressing the two guiding principles, the key is for government agencies and councils to facilitate grassroots relationships and networks. These will become a more enduring way to help support people and reduce levels of dependency on public services. To build effective relationships with Ngai Tahu, there needs to be wider acknowledgement of the enduring ancestral and cultural ties of Maori people that underpin their connectedness to places, and the social structures of whanau, hapu and iwi that offer lessons for wider community resilience.\nWHANAUNGATANGA\nRespecting, fostering and maintaining relationships with each other.\nMANAAKITANGA\nThe expression of reciprocity, hospitality and care for each other.\nKAITIAKITANGA\nWorking strategically to protect the environment for the use, enjoyment and prosperity of present and future generations.\nTURANGAWAEWAE\nA place to stand, a right to speak, an obligation to contribute to wider community wellbeing.\nUnder this goal,\nthree programmes of action\nare focused on how we will:\nCONNECT PEOPLE\nCREATE ADAPTABLE PLACES\nIMPROVE THE QUALITY AND CHOICE OF HOUSING\n3\n5\n3\nCONNECT PEOPLE\nOur experience following the\nearthquakes underlines that people\nand whanau are the building blocks of resilient communities. Across our communities as a whole, people worked together to help each other, but it was notable that those with strong neighbourhood connections sprang into action faster. Building connections and relationships between members of the community is an important investment for the future at a local level.\nSince the earthquakes, there has been widespread movement of people - some through displacement resulting from earthquake impacts, others as new arrivals taking part in\nrebuild work. This has brought new people into many of our communities and resulted in rapid establishment of new suburban housing. Helping these people to integrate into existing communities, and nurturing the establishment of local networks in new communities, is a critical way we can support them and help build resilience.\nVulnerable people are present in all our communities. While neighbourhood connections can help support these people in response to sudden events and to prevent social isolation, it is the everyday stresses endured by these people that needs more careful attention.\nResilience Value\nStrong communities are able to respond to change more rapidly and recover from unforeseen events. People who connect with each other are able to access support, resources and be part of informal support networks. This reduces dependency on public services. It will empower people to help themselves and others in times of crisis. Connectedness will better support individuals that may endure feelings of helplessness with consequential implications for mental health.\nACTION 1A\nACTION 1B\nDevelop events and local\ninformation resources to help new residents build connections with people in their immediate communities.\nWhat will we be doing? We will continue to create sources of local information and provide community activities to help new residents integrate into communities.\nThis may include welcome packs and social media resources and, in newly-built communities, events that help to establish community networks. At a city, town or suburban level, cultural events and other activities aimed at particular communities of interest will be supported as ways of helping to assimilate people and to celebrate our diversity.\nAs well as connecting people, these activities and resources can raise awareness of sources of social support, employment, travel choice options, emergency procedures and local\nnetworks that can help individuals,\ncommunities and whanau build their own resilience.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Increased levels of community engagement and participation in all activities across Greater Christchurch with improved levels of empowerment and self-help. Supportive and welcoming neighbourhoods where diverse people know each other.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tSelwyn Newcomers and Migrants Strategy\n\u2022\tMeet Your Street\n\u2022\tChristchurch Migrants Centre, providing free advice to new migrants on services and community groups\n\u2022\tInternational cultural festivals including the Lantern Festival and Diwali\nDevelop, improve and\nsustain support programmes\nfor vulnerable people as an\nenduring resilience-building activity.\nWhat will we be doing? In the aftermath of the Canterbury Earthquake Sequence, government agencies, including the district health board, collaborated on the Community in Mind Strategy.\nThis has stimulated community led-activity, innovative services and greater collaboration. Government agencies, community organisations and councils will seek funding to sustain and maintain these activities and services, with the aim of securing an enduring and evolving form of resilience-building for vulnerable people.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see?\nVulnerable people are well-supported and participate in the community, which helps to decrease feelings of isolation and loneliness. All organisations are aware of vulnerable people in our communities. Mental health support initiatives provide support at a local level.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tThe All Right? Campaign\n\u2022\tCommunity in Mind Strategy\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nPsychosocial Initiatives Review LEAD: Canterbury District Health Board\nCommitted (within 2 years)\n(NB. The implementation plan\ncontains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nCREATE ADAPTABLE PLACES\nOutside our own homes, the quality\nof the natural environment, buildings\nand the network of streets and spaces, defines the way we go about our daily lives. The convenience and safety of transport routes and travel modes\ndetermine our choice of travel. The\nambience and functionality of a space encourages us to spend time there, in turn shaping our lifestyle choices and social engagement and ultimately our physical and mental wellbeing. In this respect, equity is important. Only by enabling people of different physical abilities, cultural beliefs or with other specific needs to access and share\ntheir local environment will our\nplaces and spaces become inclusive.\nThe growth and development of\nGreater Christchurch has created a\npattern of commercial centres with\nroles and functions that are sometimes poorly defined, often to the detriment of their quality as places to spend time. Furthermore, our road-based transport network has become a dominant\nfeature of the urban environment.\nIn looking to the future, strategic investment (commercial, public and transport) is now being channelled into 14 Key Activity Centres and a network of smaller suburban centres across Greater Christchurch. The key challenge is to mould the primary commercial functions of each centre into hubs of wider activity that draw in public, cultural and community services as well as being well-placed to accommodate different types of housing. More integrated local centres\ncan reduce our need to travel. For\neveryday journeys - to work, to schools, to the shops - we need to encourage walking and cycling for short trips as part of a wider strategy to improve community health. For other journeys, alternatives to the private car need to be made more convenient if we are to avoid returning to pre-earthquake levels of congestion which will threaten the lifelines of our economy and the quality of our environment.\nIn making places more resilient, people must be a part of any process of change. Where local views are not\ntaken into account, people can become resistant to change and protective of their local public environments. This reaction can create bureaucratic drag, even on simple projects. The reverse is also true. Communities can be frustrated with the lack of ability to change things in their local environment because of rules, processes or other barriers - even when they have funding or know-how to deliver the work.\nResilience Value\nMaking the most of our places and spaces - including our urban centres, public buildings and reserves - will create inclusive, robust and safe places for people. Encouraging more intensive forms of housing around areas where social and community infrastructure is generally more concentrated, such as urban centres, will maximise use of infrastructure and public places. Integrated and inclusive urban planning can help improve community wellbeing by ensuring good connections between homes, workplaces, facilities and social and cultural activities.\nACTION 2A\nACTION 2B\nACTION 2C\nConsolidate and enhance our\nnetwork of strategic and local\ncentres to provide accessible\nfocal points for communities.\nWhat will we be doing? Led by\nlocal councils, we will develop plans,\nencourage investment and deliver\nprojects to make our centres become places that people enjoy spending time in, and from which they can satisfy multiple needs in a single convenient trip by foot, bicycle,\nbus and, as needed, using private\ncars. Around centres, opportunities\nwill be explored to develop high-\nquality medium density housing\ndevelopments.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to\nsee? Our centres prosper, containing a broader mix of uses including social venues, business hubs, different\nforms of housing, making efficient\nuse of space (e.g. parking\/servicing), and maximising the capacity of infrastructure networks.\nSuccessful current examples of\nactivities include:\n\u2022 Central Christchurch Recovery Plan\n\u2022\tSuburban Centre Masterplans -Christchurch City Council\n\u2022\tRangiora and Kaiapoi Town Centre Plans - Waimakariri District\n\u2022\tLincoln and Rolleston Town Centre Plans - Selwyn District\n\u2022\tKaiapoi Library\n\u2022\tTe Hapua - Halswell Community Centre\nPromote transport alternatives in everyday life to reduce car dependency.\nWhat will we be doing? Led by local councils, we will strategically look at opportunities to extend our public transport network and improve the quality and perceptions of services.\nAt a neighbourhood level we will look for opportunities to make walking and cycling the obvious choice for very short trips with a focus on making safe and convenient linkages using tools including Universal Design, Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) and Health Impact Assessment.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Everyone in Greater Christchurch has access to a variety of travel options. There will be increased levels of public transport patronage with more local trips made on foot or by bicycle contributing to healthier lifestyles. The potential of local rail transport is explored.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tChristchurch Cycleways Network\n\u2022\tCentral Christchurch Bus Exchange\nCollaborate with communities to create healthy, safe and welcoming facilities and places.\nWhat will we be doing? We are\ninvesting in post-earthquake facility rebuild projects that are creating new public environments where the input of communities and users are critical to their future success. Alongside these are funding streams focused on supporting delivery of community-led initiatives. A natural extension of this will be consideration of different models of ownership, including social enterprise. The physical assets of public facilities and reserves could be put into trusts or leased to a community organisation which can make its own decisions about fundraising and spending, and can harness the energy of local volunteers.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Spaces and facilities that are well-utilised for social gatherings and other activities, with a reduction in crime, vandalism and nuisance. Facilities run with community level support. Design of community facilities and spaces that have been informed and shaped by the community.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tLife in Vacant Spaces, Gap Filler and Greening the Rubble are successful Christchurch-based community driven initiatives that creatively define space and place\n\u2022\tTransition Programme\n\u2022\tAranui Community Centre artwork -funding and delivery support for public art\nIMPROVE THE QUALITY, CHOICE\nAND AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING\nOur homes are the most important\nplaces in the lives of our families.\nThe quality of our living environment influences our wellbeing and the costs to maintain our standard of living. The choice of housing available, along with how much we earn, can restrict where we live.\nThe underlying quality of the existing housing stock in Greater Christchurch (and wider New Zealand) is poor,\nreflecting the age of the majority of\nproperties. Limited insulation, lack\nof efficient heating, ventilation and\nsecurity, combined with poor build\nquality, are common characteristics.\nPoor quality homes are most common in the rental and social housing\nsectors where occupants are paying\ndisproportionate running costs and\ncan face consequent health problems.\nAs Greater Christchurch's population continues to grow it is imperative that people have access to a greater diversity of housing types and\ntenures at prices that they can afford. There is a mismatch between the supply and demand of particular types of housing, and supply is being driven from an investment-based perspective. Experience in parts of Europe has recognised that housing is an important resource where\npublic policy can play a role to guide\ndevelopment and management.\nResilience Value\nBetter quality housing means a safer\nand healthier community. A safer\nand healthier community is better\nable to participate and respond to\nshocks. Planning our communities\nand neighbourhoods to accommodate\ndiversity, including income, age\nand ethnicity, will minimise social\ndisplacement and disruption\nwhile building social cohesion and\nturangawaewae.\nACTION 3A\nACTION 3B\nContinue to support and develop\ninitiatives to improve the quality\nof new and existing housing.\nWhat will we be doing? We will develop detailed projects that help people to design better-quality forms of housing, using new construction techniques and modern resource-efficient materials, as well as working with government to incentivise retrofitting existing housing. Major programmes are also underway which will see substantial improvement and reconfiguration of social housing.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to\nsee? Improving standards of rental\nproperties, fewer housing-related\nhealthcare admissions, arresting the\ndecline in levels of home ownership.\nSuccessful current examples of\nactivities include:\n\u2022 Build Back Smarter\n\u2022 Housing Exemplar Projects\nDevelop a consistent source\nof housing research to inform\nproactive planning for Greater\nChristchurch's future housing needs.\nWhat will we be doing? In 2013,\nGovernment agencies and councils\n(working together under the Urban\nDevelopment Strategy Partnership)\ncommissioned a Greater Christchurch\nHousing Market Assessment that quantified trends and pressures on the housing market at the time, which drove policy changes.\nThe focus will be on regularly updating of\nthis type of information and, in response\nto trends, developing Greater Christchurch housing market policy interventions.\nWider research and activity may include experimentation with different housing concepts including co-housing, co-living and the use of community-centred architecture.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see?\nImproved match of supply and demand in\nhousing types, delivered with particular\nemphasis on affordable housing products\nfor those on and below median incomes.\nAhead of that, building more informed\nawareness of local housing market\ninformation and issues, including informed debate over particular interventions.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022 2013 Greater Christchurch Housing Market Assessment\n\u2022 Christchurch City Council Housing Policy \u2022 Christchurch Housing Accord\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nConsistent Housing Monitoring LEAD: Urban Development Strategy Partnership\nCommitted (within 1 year)\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nSelwyn Gets Ready\nThe Selwyn Gets Ready website is a tool used to create stronger, safer and more connected communities in Selwyn. Households enter their contact details and any special needs, resources and skills they have which could be helpful to their community in an emergency situation. Communities can use the website to organise local activities within their neighbourhood and share information that affects their safety and wellbeing. The Selwyn District Council Emergency Management team also uses the website to send important safety messages to individual households, streets, townships or the whole district about topics including severe weather, warnings of uncontrolled fires, boil water notices or local police messages.\nMeet Your Street\/Summer in Selwyn\nMeet Your Street and Summer in Selwyn also provide opportunities for people to meet their neighbours over coffee and games in local parks. Meet Your Street launched in 2015 in response to the Selwyn District's rapid population growth, at 4.5 per cent per year. Hosted by the Selwyn Youth Council and Selwyn District Council, Meet Your Street visited 40 different Selwyn streets and provided a fun, informal event with free coffee, tea and juice, to encourage residents to get to know their neighbours, feel welcome and connected. Summer in Selwyn offers free community events such as concerts and picnics in reserves across Selwyn.\nBrave - A Daisy Poetry Promenade\nThis project involved the production of a promenade arts performance in East Christchurch where the audience moved between six different spaces and experienced art forms such as poetry, DJ's music, Pasifika dance, singing, rapping, photography and videography. The Brave team built on strong relationships with artists in the community to create this celebration of Samoan heritage, identity and talent and in doing so fostered belonging, connection and pride in cultural identity. This initiative has been supported by the LinC (Leadership in Communities) project in 2015\/16.\nACTIS\nThe Aranui Community Trust Incorporated Society (ACTIS) takes a joined-up approach to support community-based recovery plans. ACTIS is locally and community driven and allows the community to assess its own needs, identify solutions to these needs and work towards implementation. ACTIS connects members of the community with social services including Housing New Zealand, community lawyers, New Zealand Police and budgeting and debt advice. ACTIS also runs events such as walking groups and sport events, and provides a public space in Aranui for drop-in sessions to assist members of the community.\nHealthy Christchurch\nHealthy Christchurch is led by the Canterbury District Health Board and is a multi-agency partnership based on the World Health Organization Healthy Cities model. Healthy Christchurch ensures all sectors and groups are acknowledged for their role in creating health-promoting environments in which we live, work, learn and play. Health services are one of the components of a health-promoting community; but the recreation, employment, youth, environmental enhancement, transport, and housing sectors are just as important to ensuring people are able to lead flourishing lives. Healthy Christchurch aims to:\n\u2022\tforge a common vision for a healthy city\n\u2022\tfoster healthy relationships between diverse agencies and sectors, from \u2018grassroots' groups to government agencies\n\u2022\tenable flexible, collaborative and prompt responses to emergent health issues\n\u2022\tensure all policy incorporates a health perspective.\nChristchurch City Council\nTransitional Programme\nWhat do you do when a central city has more vacant space than buildings? In Christchurch, the result has been both community- and Council-led initiatives to reimagine those spaces. Community groups such as Life in Vacant Spaces Trust, Gap Filler and Greening the Rubble work on projects to fill the spaces and engage with the community; the Council has created grant funding programmes and funded initiatives to improve public amenity. All are aimed at creating spaces which engage, delight and surprise residents and visitors.\nThe programme provides opportunities to test new ideas, explore new concepts and look at ways to bring people back to the city. As well as transforming under-utilised spaces, it provides opportunities for residents to be directly involved in the recovery of their city and showcase their creativity both nationally and internationally.\nNow, as a more holistic approach to regeneration emerges, we all have a role to play in creating adaptable and resilient space - even if some of those are temporary.\nYou Me We Us Kaiapoi\nYou Me We Us is an exciting, grassroots community development initiative that gives the people of Kaiapoi, Kairaki and Pines Beach the opportunity to make great things happen in their communities. Together, they encourage and allow the community to identify priorities and work collectively and co-operatively to deliver outcomes.\nThis approach enhances the wellbeing of the community where there is increased participation in volunteer work and more people involved in events and projects, creating a strong, vibrant neighbourhood and community. You Me We Us has developed strong relationships with local schools, community groups, local businesses and organisations which results in increased support and involvement from the whole community.\nThe initiative was established in September 2013 and to date, You Me We Us has held or supported a large number of successful projects and events including: Kaiapoi River clean-ups, \u2018Pop up' cinema events, spy training events for children, Adopt a Planter, Welcome Bags, Under 7s-Over-70s artwork afternoon, community pathway and giant Os & Xs board project, Kaiapoi Invisible Choir, Gardening through Schools, Food Forest Planting, and the Kaiapoi Night Market.\nYou Me We Us is an initiative that supports and encourages the community to shape and lead its own recovery, welcome new residents, and connect as a community.\nChristchurch Central Recovery Plan\nThe earthquake on 22 February 2011 resulted in the loss of 70 per cent of the buildings in Christchurch Central's core, causing large-scale displacement of commercial and public sector activity. Widespread demolition offered a unique\nopportunity to remodel the heart of a city. The Christchurch Central Recovery Plan was published in 2012, drawing on more than 100,000 contributions from the community captured in the \u2018Share an Idea' engagement process. Component parts of the Recovery Plan are now being delivered through a mix of public and private sector investment, with early recovery focused on large-scale public projects as a means to catalyse private investment. With people now returning to the city centre, the stages ahead will be about working with communities to identify and deliver regeneration opportunities that create the green, vibrant and liveable city that the Recovery Plan envisioned.\nNga Whariki Manaaki -\nWoven Mats of Welcome\nNga Whariki Manaaki is a series of 13 public realm works of art that feature an arrangement of natural stone pavers of varying shades and colours positioned along the Otakaro\/Avon River promenade. In sequence, they reference the Maori process of welcome (powhiri) and are intended as an expression of goodwill and hospitality for all visitors to the city of Christchurch.\nUrban Cycleway Projects\nOngoing cycleway improvements in Greater Christchurch provide enhanced safety and improve transport choice for residents.\nThe Waimakariri Urban Cycleways Project provides connections for residents to schools, workplaces, retail and health centres in Rangiora, linking Woodend to Rangiora and providing a connection from Rangiora to Kaiapoi and beyond to Christchurch City.\nSelwyn District's new nine kilometre off-road path for pedestrians and cyclists has provided an important link between Rolleston and Lincoln and is an important addition to the strategic cycling network which links the fast-growing townships in Eastern Selwyn and connects to Christchurch City.\nChristchurch City has also made a strong commitment to generating a significant modal shift to cycling through its Major Cycleway programme. This programme is planned to provide an extensive and connected cycleway network comprising 13 Major Cycle Routes to provide safe and direct links between the Central City and suburbs, education facilities, business and shopping zones as well as popular recreation areas. The Christchurch City Council will deliver $65 million of its $156 million Major Cycle Routes network over the next three years, with a local investment of $23.5 million.\nBuild Back Smarter\nBuild Back Smarter is a free service providing homeowners with face-to-face, no obligation, expert advice on making homes warmer, drier, healthier and cheaper to run. The Build Back Smarter service is available to all homes in Christchurch and neighbouring parts of Selwyn and Waimakariri districts. In 2015:\n\u2022\t1400 homes received a Build Back Smarter assessment\n\u2022\t82% of customers believe their home will be healthier and more efficient by following the advice provided\n\u2022\t84% of customers were satisfied or very satisfied with the service received\n\u2022\t53% have already made changes to their homes\n\u2022\tOver 2000 people visited each home on show through the Exemplar Homes Tour.\nWE ARE A COMMUNITY\nTHAT PARTICIPATES IN SHAPING THE FUTURE\nWhy this goal is important to resilience in Greater Christchurch\nA community where people contribute ideas and participate in decisionmaking is one that cares about its future.\nIn the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes local councils, government agencies and community organisations were placed in an overwhelming situation that in some instances exceeded their capacity. In response, the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA), was established by Central Government and was given resources and powers to drive the response and recovery phases. At a grassroots level, local communities, energised by the contributions they had made in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, felt empowered to express clear views about how their communities could be built back better. During 2011 and 2012, this community energy was harnessed by councils and government agencies to help shape plans for recovery, notably the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan.\nHowever as time has passed, different opinions have emerged about leadership and the ability to contribute. For communities in Selwyn and Waimakariri, sudden rapid growth and recovery has required careful planning and investment which will, in time, improve the overall viability of these communities. For Ngai Tahu, the earthquake recovery process has been a watershed period in establishing a stronger expression of rangatiratanga. Through legislation and positive influence, Papatipu Runanga have been empowered to inform, shape and embed cultural values, narratives and aspirations into the civic and private developments. Within Christchurch City, where the damage was most extensive, slow progress on major projects, wrangling over insurance and the draining experience of living in a damaged city have taken their toll. This is particularly true in the eastern suburbs. Community leaders have become exhausted while trust in governance has been eroded by decisions made using legislative powers, often behind closed doors.\nThis programme of action responds to the positive and negative experiences by looking to reinvigorate community whanaungatanga, particularly in the way that leaders, councils and government agencies engage communities and devolve responsibility, built on trust, to the community level.\nIn addressing the two guiding principles, government agencies and councils will work in a joined-up way to develop opportunities to actively engage and empower communities to drive change. This means supporting and building trust in the true spirit of civic partnership. Furthering effective relationships with Ngai Tahu will build on the positive momentum that has emerged from earthquake recovery governance arrangements by co-creating structures, agendas and action that resolves outstanding grievances, but more positively helps forge shared direction for the future.\nRANGATIRATANGA\nLeadership through collaboration, maintaining a high degree of personal integrity and ethical behaviour in all actions and decisions.\nWHANAUNGATANGA\nRespecting, fostering and maintaining relationships with each other.\nUnder this goal,\ntwo programmes of action are focused on how we will:\nBUILD PARTICIPATION AND TRUST IN DECISION-MAKING\nSUPPORT THE COMMUNITY\nSECTOR AND COMMUNITY LEADERS\nBUILD PARTICIPATION AND\nTRUST IN DECISION-MAKING\nPeople gain satisfaction from taking part in even small activities that give a sense of purpose and achievement. Lack of opportunities for participation can lead to a sense of powerlessness which compounds psychological stress and increases apathy with governance structures. Across Greater Christchurch, the community has become increasingly frustrated about the uncertainty of governance arrangements for long-term recovery and resilience, particularly in Christchurch City. The role of central government, both immediately postdisaster and through the recovery, has been a key issue along with concerns about turnover in leadership positions due to burn-out. Given the point in recovery that Greater Christchurch is approaching, such frustrations and concerns around trust, empowerment,\ntransparency, participation and governance must be addressed.\nThe challenge is to build a more trusting relationship between communities and decision-makers in Greater Christchurch. Central to this is changing the way in which governance engages with people, as all too often their processes rely on rigid and formulaic methods that are set up to be adversarial. These processes make engagement difficult, and are often protracted, meaning that people struggle to keep up with what is being decided.\nTransparent and participatory governance empowers the community to collaborate on plans and initiatives in areas which affect their interests.\nResilience Value\nPersonal involvement, engagement and activism aid the recovery of individuals, especially following a sudden event. This enhances wellbeing and a sense of belonging for those in supporting roles and those being supported. Long-term, the collective participation of individuals builds a sense of place in a community and collective effort to get things done. It is important that the necessary tools and resources are available for citizens to feel empowered and effect change.\nACTION 4A\nACTION 4B\nExperiment with alternative\nforms of public participation\nto promote awareness of\nissues and engage people in\ndecision-making.\nWhat will we be doing? Councils\nand government agencies will\nseek alternative forms of public\nengagement and experiment\nwith them to improve the quality\nof communication. To develop\nprojects, policies or initiatives we\nwill explore ways to involve people\nat the earliest stages so that more\ninclusive and effective outcomes can be achieved. Councils will look at how Community Boards, advisory groups and working parties involve members of the community across Greater\nChristchurch and share best practice.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to\nsee? People are more informed\nabout the issues that community\nleaders have to make decisions on and there is greater engagement of the \u2018silent majority' on important issues, improving levels of confidence in\ndecision-making. There is increased\nvoting participation in local elections.\nSuccessful current examples of\nactivities include:\n\u2022 Eastern Vision\/Evo::Space\n\u2022 Let's Plan - Waimakariri Red Zone engagement process\nDevelop tools, mechanisms and processes that enable individuals to be more active participants in the success of Greater Christchurch.\nWhat will we be doing? Councils and\ngovernment agencies will develop, trial and roll out initiatives to enable people to take ownership and\/ or leadership of issues that drive change. Areas under consideration include wider publication of regular Open Source data that could be developed for commercial or social enterprise purposes and alternative, inclusive plan-making processes. We will explore opportunities emerging through wider use of mobile technology.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? More active participation and engagement in problem identification and solving stages of public service project development.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tSnap Send Solve\n\u2022\tLittle River Community Plan -a community-initiated plan supported by Council staff and resources which is as much about local action as it is about longer-term infrastructure investment\nSUPPORT COMMUNITY\nORGANISATIONS AND LEADERS\nA study of community-based support during and following the earthquakes found it enhanced the wellbeing and sense of belonging of both those in the supporting role and those being supported. The act of contributing is crucial in adapting during and after disasters and in building resilience to adverse events. However, this phenomenon is not entirely self-sustaining. The support of external organisations, such as central government and councils, is essential to the ongoing success and sustainability of such community initiatives.\nAt a grassroots level, the key for external organisations is to limit the amount of precious volunteer-time tied up in complex bureaucracy, delays because of legal technicalities, or\nhold-ups to the action because the right equipment cannot be provided at the right time. These types of barriers can be highly demotivating for people who are the driving force for making things happen. Similarly, community leaders who bring energy to drive local action can become overwhelmed and are vulnerable to fatigue by being overlooked and taken for granted.\nAt the community, voluntary and not-for-profit level, organisations rely on funding arrangements and contracts with government agencies, councils or other service providers. As a result business models and project plans can be very short-term in nature, while the scale of activity can be unavoidably limited. Creating a more stable platform of funding and support for our community organisations\nand voluntary sector means they can continue to deliver existing programmes and invest in bigger projects with more confidence.\nResilience Value\nWith strong grassroots connections, community organisations can be leaders and natural partners with government agencies and councils in driving social, environmental, cultural and economic wellbeing. Whether as part of everyday support systems, or in times of crisis, community and voluntary organisations are a vital source of support, energy and knowledge. Supporting these community organisations as partners in maintaining the wellbeing of our communities is an investment in our future resilience.\nACTION 5A\nACTION 5B\nACTION 5C\nProvide support services that enable community groups and leaders to resolve administrative and regulatory processes.\nWhat will we be doing? Together we will design and develop support frameworks that simplify bureaucratic processes, provide appropriate technical expertise and otherwise enable community groups to focus on the delivery of outcomes. Support arrangements and training programmes that build the capability of community leaders will also be reviewed.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? The community sector reduces expenditure of effort on processes. Groups are able to access readily identifiable sources of support to build more confident and skilled community leaders.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tLyttelton Time Bank\n\u2022\tLife in Vacant Spaces Trust\n\u2022\tStudent Volunteer Army\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nPlace Based Planning Framework LEAD: Christchurch City Council\nIn Progress (within 1 year)\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nFacilitate networking between community organisations as a means to develop shared direction and more efficient use of resources.\nWhat will we be doing? We will develop and maintain open databases of community organisations, encourage networking and host forums around complex or strategic issues. We will also encourage crosssector collaboration to develop integrated solutions to community issues and better sharing of resources.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Stronger community voices able to articulate wider perspectives on particular issues with more effective resource sharing, joint commissioning of projects and leveraging of private sector funding to reduce dependency on public services.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tChristchurch Housing Forum -an open forum involving council, community and voluntary sector interests concerned with housing related issues\n\u2022\tMinistry of Awesome - \u2018Canterbury Innovation Ecosystem Map'\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nCommunity Group\/\nResource Mapping LEAD: Urban Development Strategy Partners\nIn Progress (1-2 years)\nStrengthen funding\narrangements to build confidence and stimulate investment in the community and voluntary sector.\nWhat will we be doing? Councils, government agencies and community organisations will develop and enhance funding arrangements by establishing new models of funding agreements, longer-term service contracts and funding roundtables. These approaches will have collaboration and cooperation at their core, looking at ways to grow the community and voluntary sector and, as opportunities arise, support the establishment of social enterprises.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Closer partnering arrangements between government agencies, councils and the community and voluntary sector. Longer-term investment in staff, assets and resources with links to business where opportunities arise.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022 LinC Project\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nFunding Roundtables\/Multi Year Agreements\/Alliance models LEADS: Councils\/Govt Agencies\nTo Develop (1-3 years)\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nSnap Send Solve\nSnap Send Solve is a free smartphone app used by the Waimakariri District, Selwyn District, and Christchurch City councils to help make reporting issues easy, thereby facilitating participation and empowering community members.\nIf residents spot something in the district such as a pothole, vandalism, litter or a damaged footpath, it can be instantly reported from a mobile phone. The report is then allocated to the relevant Council department.\nEastern Vision\nEastern Vision is a group of community leaders focused on the regeneration of the eastern flatland suburbs of Christchurch. It advocates for community participation in regeneration decisions which is informed by robust science and technical information and integrated planning. The organisation established a website EVO::SPACE which provides a one-stop-shop platform to engage members of the public, collate and map proposals for the east, and generate an analysis report and map of community aspirations. The website acts as a forum for community empowerment by providing information which supports a greater understanding of the ongoing ideas for the regeneration of the eastern suburbs of Christchurch. The website was complemented by a seven-part TV series Eyes East which remains available for viewing online. Eastern Vision aims to help communities create a big-picture plan for the whole of the east that is widely supported and that will still work in 100 years' time. To support this, the organisation has developed, and will continue to develop, relationships with government and other agencies to make information readily and reliably available online for members of the community.\nLinC Project\nThe LinC Project (Leadership in Communities) is facilitated by Leadership Lab to support local leaders and recognised change agents drawn from the voluntary, non-governmental organisations, and central and local government sectors across Greater Christchurch. Objectives of the LinC Project include increasing knowledge, skills and confidence as well as strengthening collaborations at a community level, including projects and initiatives that build local connections and wellbeing.\nDuring 2015, this 10-month, strengths-based leadership programme worked with 40 leaders from diverse communities of interest across Greater Christchurch.\nA second group of 45 leaders began the programme in December 2015, 35 of these from community organisations and 10 from government organisations.\nFunding and other support for the LinC Project have been contributed by the New Zealand Red Cross, Rata Foundation (formerly Canterbury Community Trust), Ministry for Social Development, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Community in Mind Strategy), the Wayne Francis Charitable Trust, the Tindall Foundation, Christchurch City Council, Selwyn District Council, Waimakariri District Council, Ara Institute of Canterbury (formerly Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology and Aoraki Polytechnic) and the University of Canterbury.\nStudent Volunteer Army (SVA)\nThe Student Volunteer Army was created in 2010 through a Facebook page for those wanting to volunteer in response to the September earthquake. Throughout all the major earthquakes, more than 11,000 students were mobilised to clear liquefaction and offer support for other organisations and for residents.\nThe movement has spread to more than eight countries and is focused on young people being involved in volunteering as a way to inquire, problem solve and contribute to the community. In 2016, the Student Volunteer Army launched \u2018Serve For NZ' to mobilise people to volunteer on public holidays, instead of just waiting for a disaster.\nFriday Night All Stars (Rangiora)\nThis recently-created basketball All Stars event, developed as part of the North Canterbury Basketball league, aims to create an avenue for deeper community engagement and provide a public platform where participants can realise their dreams. The All Stars event involves a large public sporting fixture which features key young and emerging players from \u201cnorth and south\u201d. This event has created strong interest and participation from the wider community and has had a very positive impact on community connection and celebration. This initiative was supported by the LinC (Leadership in Communities) Project in 2015.\nLyttelton Harbour TimeBank\nTimeBanks have worked very effectively in some communities and provide a means of both engaging with, and encouraging participation across a community. TimeBanking is a way of trading skills in a community that is not based on money, but rather on time as a measurement tool. TimeBanking can be used by individuals or groups to trade skills and fill in each other's gaps\/needs through non-financial means. Project Lyttelton set up New Zealand's first ever TimeBank. Participants have built up a local marketplace of members' skills and abilities, creating a publicly-available community skills inventory. The Lyttelton Harbour TimeBank has been operating for 11 years and boasts more than 700 members.\nWE ARE PROSPEROUS BY SUSTAINING\nTHE VITALITY OF THE NATURAL\nENVIRONMENT, FOSTERING INNOVATION\nAND ATTRACTING PEOPLE\nWhy this goal is important to resilience in Greater Christchurch\nProsperity covers an array of values and wellbeings including tangible measures,\nsuch as material wealth, as well as measures of health and the notion of ecosystem service benefits. The resilience of Greater Christchurch's prosperity is based on sustaining our environment, nurturing people to maximise their potential, diversifying our output (particularly by embracing innovation to generate higher value output) and making connections nationally and internationally.\nWhanaungatanga remains as important as ever to establish and develop trading partnerships. Our ability to contribute quality products, skills and knowledge in international partnerships can help protect us from global economic changes.\nAt a strategic level, building relationships with global consumers is essential in attracting tourism, people and ideas that support a modern innovative economy.\nAttracting new people, while still supporting and nurturing our own people, is essential to rebalance our ageing population and workforce. Investing in community, recreational, environmental and cultural facilities and services, as well as being able to offer good jobs and a safe healthy environment, helps retain existing residents and attract young skilled migrants.\nTohungatanga is at the heart of innovation and our ability to respond to the pace of technological change. The world is experiencing rapid inter-connected technological, societal, environmental and geo-political change which creates both opportunities and challenges for individuals, businesses and cities. Greater Christchurch is well-positioned to respond to these challenges and opportunities with strong education and research infrastructure that can support and foster innovation. Many ideas, businesses and social enterprises were borne out of the Canterbury Earthquake Sequence and provide an important foundation for building prosperity.\nUnderpinning a prosperous economy is kaitiakitanga. Greater Christchurch is situated among a stunning backdrop of hills, mountains, rivers and beaches. Centuries ago, it was this rich, natural abundance that first drew people to our region. Today, our natural environment remains our most important asset, underpinning our regional agricultural economy, attracting visitors and new residents from around the world, and providing essential ecosystem services.\nGovernment agencies and councils support the two guiding principles by working together to build confidence and invest in people and enterprises.\nTaking steps to safeguard the restoration of our natural environment will support the foundation of our prosperity. Effective relationships with Ngai Tahu will be founded on supporting growth and diversification of Maori business, improving skills, and collaborating in new ventures.\nTOHUNGATANGA\nRecognising the value of experience, expertise and the pursuit of knowledge and ideas that will strengthen and grow individuals, whanau and communities.\nKAITIAKITANGA\nWorking strategically to protect the environment for the use, enjoyment and prosperity of present and future generations.\nWHANAUNGATANGA\nRespecting, fostering and maintaining relationships with each other.\nUnder this goal, three programmes of action are focused on how we will:\nCONNECT INTERNATIONALLY\nFOSTER A CULTURE OF INNOVATION\nSUSTAIN THE VITALITY OF\nOUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT\nCONNECT INTERNATIONALLY\nBuilding strong connections is essential for the flow of people, ideas and resources into and around Greater Christchurch. We already have good local business networks and support systems, which provide a foundation for further sharing of knowledge and the development of stronger commercial partnerships. Further improvement of the breadth and depth of our international connections can build more integrated trading and research partnerships. Without relationships, our products and opportunities are faceless, unknown and perceptually \u2018risky' to consumers around the world.\nThe number of people retiring will increase from 25,000 to 30,000 per year over the next decade. At the same time the proportion of people under 16 is projected to remain static over the next 20 years. While technology may take up some of this gap, employers may face increasing skill shortages and rapidly rising labour costs that may threaten our economic base.\nThe infrastructure that connects Greater Christchurch to the world is important to all sectors of our economy. Continued investment in our international airport and Lyttelton\nPort are important for exporting businesses, tourism and provide opportunities to further leverage international connections.\nResilience Value\nOur economy remains strongly influenced by our ability to export primary sector products and resources, and increasingly on tourism. Growing the flow of people, ideas, and resources to realise new opportunities can soften the impact from global economic shocks and maintain Greater Christchurch's relevance and competitiveness into the future.\nACTION 6A\nACTION 6B\nBuild strong national and international connections as foundations to attract people, develop markets and stimulate collaboration.\nWhat will we be doing? Greater\nChristchurch needs to sell itself and its opportunities to individuals worldwide as a place of high-quality output, research and innovation, and natural beauty. We will develop initiatives that market Greater Christchurch to overseas investors, visitors and workers. We will also provide support to overseas investors and use people to match investors with opportunities.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see?\nA clearer Greater Christchurch story being told overseas that articulates the investment opportunities and the attractions for visitors and talent. Better access to capital will help develop products and services, while international collaborations will be more common. The number of tourists using Christchurch as a gateway to the South Island and New Zealand will continue to increase.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tMinistry of Awesome\n\u2022\tCanterbury International Education Leadership Accord\n\u2022\tAntarctic Support Programme\n\u2022\tSister Cities\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\n\u2022\tGuangdong Strategy\nLEAD: Christchurch City Council\nCommitted (1-2 years)\n\u2022\tAttraction Strategy\nLEAD: Canterbury Development Corporation\nIn Progress (1-2 years)\n\u2022\tAntarctic Strategy\nLEAD: Christchurch Antarctic Office\nCommitted (within 1 years)\nFuture proof our physical infrastructure to safeguard our economic performance and overseas trading connections.\nWhat will we be doing? Continued investment in the growth of Lyttelton Port through the Lyttelton Port Recovery Plan, and maximising the numbers of passengers through Christchurch International Airport will help build connections to international markets. The sub-regional roll out of fibre broadband and ongoing dialogue around a South Island international data cable link will better connect our communities and businesses to the world. Beyond these, further evaluation of the risks to our infrastructure networks are important to maintaining our resilience.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Increasing use of our upgraded port and airport capacity as conduits for trade. Growth of business and service activity, particularly in more remote communities, using communication technology. Investment in alternative\/backup digital capability.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tLyttelton Port Recovery Plan\n\u2022\tChristchurch Airport Open Sky Policy\nACTION 6C\nInvest in attracting and retaining workers from overseas to supplement our ageing workforce and stimulate new business ideas.\nWhat will we be doing? Retaining the estimated 25,000 workers who came to Christchurch to work on the rebuild, and harnessing their skills in other industries, could be an important economic legacy of the earthquakes. The other key opportunity lies in retaining more of our own young people and attracting others from overseas through our universities and tertiary education institutes, which are building strong links to local businesses.\nActions, initiatives and projects contained within Programmes 1, 2 and 3 of this Plan are important to activities around skills and training. The availability of affordable, quality housing, attractive living environments and a sense of belonging are all important for young people and migrants considering a future in Greater Christchurch.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Continued post-rebuild interest in migration to Greater Christchurch, higher levels of conversion of work visas to permanent resident visas and citizenship among rebuild workers, stability and decline in the outflow of younger people, further alignment of education and business to build the skills of the future.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022 Starts with a Smile\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other\nproposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nFOSTER A CULTURE OF INNOVATION\nOur economy has low wage and productivity rates relative to other cities in Australasia, and is dependent to a great degree on the regional agricultural industry which itself is strongly influenced by volatility in international commodity markets.\nWith a large, stable talent pool fed by three major tertiary institutions and seven Crown Research Institutes we can broaden the base of our economy, act as a magnet for talent and investment, and help our companies build stronger links into world markets. Developing higher value products is a key opportunity for our economy, as demonstrated by the agricultural research sector.\nCreating environments which stimulate and enable innovation\nand the commercialisation of ideas is an important part of developing our knowledge and creative sectors. Projects are already emerging in the form of Innovation Hubs which seek to co-locate research, businesses and commercialisation expertise to drive new product development and associated spin-offs.\nThe pace of change in technology, social trends and product development means that obsolescence is an increasing risk. For our companies, investment is precious and we need to ensure that the decisions we make today build in enough flexibility and adaptability to cope with change.\nSocial enterprises represent an underdeveloped part of our economy\nthat can create more sustainable employment, improve the quality of our environments and empower the community and voluntary sector to deliver services better.\nResilience Value\nBecoming an urban region that champions imaginative, creative, innovative people can help transform our economy by developing higher value products, processes and new technologies. In turn, these can make us less reliant on supply chains that are forged around selling bulk products onto volatile world markets. Keeping abreast of technological change is also important in keeping our products and places relevant to people - local or international.\nACTION 7A\nSupport an environment that enables innovation and creativity as means to diversify our economy and add value to\nour production.\nWhat will we be doing? We will collaborate to further develop innovative and creative networks, simplify processes and procedures that stand in the way of commercial development of opportunities, and support research activities that can improve productivity or open new horizons. Showcase events bring people together in relation to particular fields of activity and provide opportunities to share ideas and develop collaborations.\nThe SMART City concept takes the idea of local innovation precincts further by embedding technology and enabling opportunities for commercial and public sector organisations to collaborate. For government agencies and councils this will allow better choices about resource uses in the urban environment, extend real-time control of city assets and make shared use of commercial systems.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see?\nAn increasing diversity of employment activities, increases in productivity, national and international scale product development collaborations, emergence of national and international research capabilities, increasing wages\/incomes, continued high levels of entrepreneurial activity and small business formation.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tBusiness Friendly Councils\n\u2022\tEPIC and the Innovation Precinct\n\u2022\tPowerhouse\n\u2022\tFoodSouth\n\u2022\tGreenHouse\n\u2022\tCreative Industries Support Fund\n\u2022\tAgResearch\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\n\u2022\tSMART City\nLEAD: Christchurch City Council\nCommitted (1-2 years)\n\u2022\tRegional Innovation Strategy Projects LEAD: Canterbury Development Corporation\nCommitted (0-2 years)\nACTION 7B\nCommissioning of research and regular reviews of global and technological trends to maintain awareness of fast moving change.\nWhat will we be doing?\nGovernment agencies, councils and the private sector will collaborate to understand how change will affect how we work, travel, communicate, access services and manage our environment to encourage smart choices and avoid wasteful duplication or inefficiencies in resource use.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Informed private, public and community sector organisations, willingness to take up and experiment with new ideas, effective future-proof investment in innovation that exploits emergent technologies.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022 Canterbury Development Corporation and Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce speaker and events programmes\nInitial committed projects identified\nin the Implementation Plan\nFuture Ready Programme of Action\nLEAD: Christchurch City Council\nTo Develop (1-3 years)\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nACTION 7C\nSupport the emergence of the social enterprise sector as partners in driving change in our communities.\nWhat will we be doing? We will support the development of the embryonic social enterprise sector and host the Social Enterprise World Forum in 2017, exposing us to international best practice, stimulating collaboration and building global relationships.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Emergence of social enterprises as positive agents of change, adjustments in traditional markets, evolution of public services into the not-for-profit sector.\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nHosting of the 2017 Social Enterprise World Forum LEAD: Akina Foundation\nIn Progress (within 1 year)\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other\nproposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nSUSTAIN THE VITALITY OF\nTHE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT\nOur prosperity is built on the quality of our natural environment. Settlement of the Greater Christchurch by Maori, and subsequently European colonists, relied on the quality and diversity of environmental assets, including fisheries, clean water, productive land and access to the coast. Today these assets remain critical to our economy, providing us with food, water, fibre, and timber, and regulation of climate and air quality.\nMahinga kai is a cornerstone of Ngai Tahu identity that relates to the hunting and gathering of natural resources which fed whanau and kept them together. Urban development has reduced opportunities to access mahinga kai and impacted the quality of the natural environment from which it is sourced. As with other urban areas, Greater Christchurch relies on food supply chains which are dominated by external sources subject to national and global price and supply issues.\nWithout our natural environment we would have no prosperity. Over time the quality of our natural environment has deteriorated with loss of indigenous biodiversity, draining of wetlands and waterway pollution. For our natural environment to continue to support us we need to better understand our role within the ecosystem and continually care for the health and life of our surroundings.\nCentral to this programme is collaboration to align resources, build knowledge and develop consistent approaches which acknowledge the fact that we all have a stake in our environment and that everyone's piece of the environment has value.\nResilience Value\nResilient communities are rooted in resilient environments. Sourcing food locally reduces the cost, carbon footprint and dependency on global markets, supports local food\nproducers and improves accessibility to healthy food. Greater Christchurch is blessed with a variety of natural assets which are irreplaceable. Just as strong interpersonal relationships can assist in building resilience, close connections with our natural surroundings help us have perspective in facing everyday stresses and can sustain us in times of crisis and need.\nFostering closer connections between people and place will increase our \u2018urban awareness' of nature's ecosystem services. Strategic identification, protection and enhancement of \u2018blue' and \u2018green' corridors will help rebuild nature's resilience, supplement the costs of urban and rural infrastructure (e.g. stormwater management), and buffer us against acute shocks and chronic stresses.\nACTION 8A\nACTION 8B\nBuild capacity to source food from our local and urban environments to sustain our people and rediscover our relationships with nature.\nWhat will we be doing? Within our\nnatural environment, particularly our rivers, we will re-evaluate the modifications we have made and the maintenance programmes we use to encourage the restoration of their ecological functions. Beyond this we will develop public and community land, or temporarily lease private land, to develop community gardens, edible forests, rongoa (medicine gardens) and other projects involving local resource production.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see?\nRe-emergence of local food supply chains and a local food economy. Wider participation in community gardening that supplements local market gardening and larger-scale agriculture. More community gardens that act as productive and social hubs where people can build relationships and more healthy lifestyles.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tChristchurch Food Resilience Policy\n\u2022\tWhaka-inaka\n\u2022\tFood Resilience Network Action Plan\n\u2022\tEdible Canterbury - campaign to develop interest and collaboration\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nOtakaro Orchard\nLEAD: Food Resilience Network\nCommitted (1-3 years)\nDevelop projects and initiatives that support restoration of indigenous biodiversity across an ecological network.\nWhat will we be doing? We will establish a partnership to drive co-ordinated action across the multitude of environmental interests (funders, regulators, academics, volunteers) across Greater Christchurch. This partnership can be a collective advocate for restoring biodiversity, driving short term activity, and helping identify strategic priorities for a sustainable ecological network.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Co-ordinated restoration and enhancement of indigenous biodiversity in Greater Christchurch to provide a sustainable ecological network and biodiversity corridors. An increase in indigenous biodiversity in Greater Christchurch.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022 Mahinga Kai Exemplar\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nDevelop a Local Biodiversity Partnership\nLEAD: Urban Development Strategy Partnership\nTo Develop (1-3 years)\n(NB.

The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nMinistry of Awesome\nMinistry of Awesome connects awesome ideas with the resources to turn them into reality - people, funding, mentors, government entry points and enthusiasm, all with the aim of rippling awesome through our community to strengthen, encourage and inspire. Ministry of Awesome believes that an awesome city is by definition a compelling place to invest, create businesses, seek employment, as well as a place of love, laughter, and delight. Ministry of Awesome offers a variety of services including: start-up\/idea mentorship, events, consulting, coworking spaces, and ecosystem development and engagement. It fosters the entrepreneurial ecosystem with regular events and educational workshops, runs two welcoming and inspiring Awesome HQ co-working spaces, and offers one-on-one support through the Start-Up Activator Programme.\nOne of the ways it has helped to engage, activate, and connect the community in Greater Christchurch is by partnering with Canterbury Development Corporation to create a web-based ecosystem map that connects entrepreneurs and innovators to the resources they need. Whether they are working on an idea, preparing to launch a new business, or seeking support for an existing venture, the Innovation Map can put entrepreneurs in touch with the people they need to talk to. Key partners include the Christchurch City Council and the Rata Foundation.\nStarts with a Smile\nThe Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce campaign encourages the general public to make new migrants feel welcome and to stay by \u2018starting with\na smile.' The campaign encourages Kiwi-born residents of Christchurch to interact with the new arrivals from overseas, many of whom have formed part of the migrant workforce for the Canterbury Rebuild and who will permanently migrate to New Zealand.\nThis collaborative project includes a wide range of partner and supporting organisations such as the Rata Foundation, the Canterbury District Health Board, schools, construction companies, law firms, and Christchurch City Council. Marketing\nmaterial appears on billboards, posters, media and social media, and through a travelling \u201cSmile Couch\u201d which visits different locations to get people from different ethnic backgrounds talking.\nChristchurch Airport\nOpen Sky Policy\nThis policy has removed regulatory access issues for foreign carriers to use more of the available air capacity into the South Island through Christchurch International Airport. Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand, Virgin and Jetstar have increased their services or are using larger aircraft, while Qantas, China Airlines and China Southern are running new services. Passenger numbers now exceed pre-earthquake levels.\nEPIC\nEPIC recognises that \u201cinnovation is a major driver of economic growth in Canterbury, helping create high value jobs, pay for local services and raise our\nregion's quality of life.\u201d The EPIC (Sanctuary) building was established to house local Canterbury businesses displaced by the Canterbury earthquakes. EPIC was the first commercial venture back into the Central City red zone, following the Re:Start Mall, and was a finalist in the 2013 Champions of Canterbury Business Awards. EPIC now has 30 information and communications technologies (ICT)\/high-tech focused companies under its roof, and is home for between 250-300 full-time workers engaging in active collaboration with each other every day.\npowerHouse\nWhile great value is stored in the knowledge held by research-based organisations, it is internationally recognised that the process of transforming academic knowledge into successful business models, commercial operations and sales is extremely challenging. powerHouse is a company based in Christchurch that has developed a unique model resulting in a high rate of commercial \u201cspin-out\u201d companies from academic institutions.\nIn New Zealand last year, the 100 high-value Technology Investment Network manufacturing and technology companies (TIN100), some of which are based in Canterbury, grew by 5% to record revenues of NZ$7 billion. Exports grew by 4% to over NZ$5 billion. powerHouse's purpose is to create more high-value technology companies like these. Canterbury Development Corporation was an establishment shareholder of powerHouse when the company was formed in 2008 to meet an identified market failure at that time, to provide a source of capital for intellectual property-based, early-stage ventures.\nEdible Canterbury\nEdible Canterbury evolved partly as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes when more people became aware both of how insecure our current food system is, and of the incredible opportunity presented through the availability of good land to grow more food locally.\nA food resilience hui was held at the University of Canterbury in 2013, cohosted by Soil and Health Canterbury and the Rangiora Earthquake Express.\nThis resulted in a Food Resilience Network, which in 2014 established Edible Canterbury.\nThe agencies involved in Edible Canterbury include those focused on social, cultural and ecological issues, social enterprise, public health, and local government, enabling us to examine the question of food availability from a wide range of perspectives.\n\nMahinga Kai Exemplar Project\nTe Runanga o Ngai Tahu, Ngai Tuahuriri, the Avon Otakaro Network and the Canterbury Waterways Research Centre are working together to develop an exemplar project for the protection and enhancement of mahinga kai values along the Avon River\/Otakaro corridor at Anzac Drive Reserve.\nMahinga kai is the Ngai Tahu term for foods and other natural resources, the places where those resources are found, and the philosophies and practices that surround them. The abundance of mahinga kai is indicative of kaitiakitanga (good stewardship, sustainable management) values in action, and the effective collaboration of local community leaders, groups and individuals to act in respect of their environment.\nThe Mahinga Kai Exemplar project aims to increase understanding of mahinga kai and kaitiakitanga values along the river in the hope that others adopt these philosophies and practices in their own community projects and backyards. Relationships have been developed with schools, Canterbury University, community members and businesses, NGOs, polititians and local and central government agencies.\nProject leaders want to bring local people together to help restore the natural heritage values of their neighbourhood and, in the process, help create a healthy, safe and welcoming environment that provides opportunities for education, learning, physical and spiritual sustenance.\nWhaka-Inaka : Causing Whitebait\nInaka (Galaxias maculatus) is the South Island dialect for inanga (whitebait). It is one of the five whitebait species in NZ and the only one found in the Otakaro\/ Avon River. Whitebaiting in heartland New Zealand is one of our quintessentially \u201ckiwi\u201d pastimes. Year in, year out, whitebaiting draws fishers and their families to river mouths and has clear social, cultural, recreational and economic wellbeing outcomes for whanau and families throughout the country.\nThe Whaka-Inaka : Causing Whitebait project was initiated in February 2016 in recognition of the degraded state of inaka habitat in Otautahi\/Christchurch, and a strong desire to take a lead in promoting an improvement to this situation. The project aims ultimately to increase the number of inaka in local rivers, believing that this will have significant wellbeing outcomes for local whanau and families.\nOur strategy has been to build greater awareness and understanding of the habitat needs of inaka, which require dense vegetation and shade along the margins of the river on the high \u2018spring' tides of late summer and autumn.\n\u201cBy laying their eggs in vegetation along the banks during the highest \u2018spring' tides, inaka can keep their eggs safe from predators in the river,\u201d says Dr. Mike Hickford, research biologist at the University of Canterbury (Marine Ecology Research Group), and project partner for Whaka Inaka. \u201cThis however makes\nthem more vulnerable to changes to the riverbanks where they spawn. At the end of the day, if there is no habitat, then there will be no eggs and ultimately no fish.\u201d\nIn February of this year, 192 straw bales were installed at 34 sites along the lower reaches of the Opawaho\/Heathcote River and around Lake Kate Sheppard on the Otakaro\/Avon River. \u201cThe bales act like the Hotel Hilton for inaka,\u201d says\nproject leader and principal scientist at EOS Ecology, Shelley McMurtrie. \u201cThey provide much-needed spawning habitat for inaka and effectively highlight where they prefer to lay their eggs if the right conditions were present. Our monitoring and research will be able to paint a clear picture to the community and Council where whitebait spawn. We have monitored the bales for egg presence and abundance from February to June, and now have a much clearer understanding of where whitebait would spawn.\u201d\n\u201cThe project is a model of collaboration between science, education, iwi, business, government and nongovernment organisations,\u201d says Te Marino Lenihan, a customary fisheries representative for Ngai Tuahuriri and Whaka-Inaka project partner. \u201cOne of the greatest outcomes of our project is the number of local schools that have helped us monitor the straw bales every week from February to June. Our children are having fun in the field and learning by doing. I see them as the next generation of river guardians, and hope that our legacy for them is a river full of fish. Just imagine how well-off our city will be when that happens.\u201d\nPhotos at left \u00a9 EOS Ecology, www.eosecology.co.nz\nWE UNDERSTAND OUR RISKS TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR FUTURE CHALLENGES\nWhy this goal is important to resilience in Greater Christchurch\nFollowing the Canterbury earthquakes, individuals, communities and agencies in Greater Christchurch have an improved understanding of the need to be prepared for emergencies, as well as the many impacts of earthquakes. The key to planning for the future resilience of the region is to help people draw on consistent knowledge about other risks and hazards that they can understand and relate to.\nUnderstanding the risk from disaster is a worldwide issue. In 2013 the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned that economic losses from disasters were out of control. The direct global financial costs of disasters from 2000 to 2013 amounted to an estimated US$2.5 trillion. As a response, the 2015 World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction approved the Sendai Framework which has four priorities for action to prevent and reduce exposure to disaster risks -understanding, managing\/avoiding, mitigating and preparing.\nFor Greater Christchurch, tohungatanga is essential as a basis to be better prepared for future challenges, while rangatiratanga is needed to help our communities make complex decisions about how we prepare for the future. Strong leadership is needed to help us balance our responses, which will need to consider risk reduction, risk transfer and risk acceptance.\nTo truly understand and prepare for future risks, we will need to make informed decisions about our vulnerabilities, how much we are prepared to pay as communities and households to safeguard and offset those risks, and whether we can live with the residual risks. This approach applies to the risks of natural hazards, financial decisions, travel, sporting activities and even everyday activities like driving a car or crossing the road.\nThese decisions inevitably cross over into kaitiakitanga - how our generation makes important calls on the future use of land and resources, and safeguards our lives and livelihoods.\nIn addressing the two guiding principles, government agencies and councils have a central leadership role in developing a shared platform of knowledge and understanding. People need to know the risks and be involved in decision-making on responses that affect them and future generations. Effective relationships with Ngai Tahu will be founded on joint decision-making around risk that takes a wider cultural perspective on the relationships between people and places, embedding the role of stewardship during our lifetimes.\nTOHUNGATANGA\nRecognising the value of experience, expertise and the pursuit of knowledge and ideas that will strengthen and grow individuals, whanau and communities.\nKAITIAKITANGA\nWorking strategically to protect the environment for the use, enjoyment and prosperity of present and future generations.\nRANGATIRATANGA\nLeadership through collaboration, maintaining a high degree of personal integrity and ethical behaviour in all actions and decisions.\nUnder this goal,\nthree programmes of action are focused on how we will:\nIMPROVE COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF RISK MANAGE THE RISKS WE FACE\nSECURE OUR FUTURE IN THE EASTERN PARTS OF CHRISTCHURCH\nIMPROVE COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF RISK\nInternational debate around climate change over the last 30 years has demonstrated that complex science, vested interests, inconsistent messaging from governments and technical experts can combine to dilute debate about necessary change.\nGreater Christchurch faces a range of risks that we collectively need to understand and make decisions about. Better conversations with the community to improve understanding and acceptance of risk is a key component of community resilience planning.\nEvery day we live with risks - when we cross the road, when we use electrical appliances, when we participate in sports and recreational pursuits.\nRisk does not stop us doing things but, consciously or sub-consciously, we consider how we go about those activities to minimise the risks involved. In facing decisions about how we respond to the threats and hazards that face our communities, people need to understand the available\ninformation and then come to their own and collective conclusions about levels of risk they are prepared to accept and potentially take steps that lessen risks.\nThis level of understanding and acceptance is essential to better inform decisions across all types of risk - what is the expected impact, consequence, and the likelihood of that happening? Armed with this understanding people can then decide what they are willing to accept and the steps they need to make to minimise the exposure to effects, or the level of impact they can absorb or offset by other means.\nThe use of quantitative risk assessment in land use planning and resilience needs considerable discussion and community involvement. This approach has been applied in the Port Hills since the earthquakes. Even when the theoretical levels of risk were published, most people were prepared to accept the risk. Perhaps this was\nbecause, intuitively, people recognised that such a low probability was \u201calmost incredible\u201d: theoretically possible but not expected to occur.\nResilience Value\nBy building capacity to understand and accept risk, everyone will have the same knowledge of the stresses and shocks that we are likely to face. Enabling engagement between the community and councils in responding to managing risk will help build trust between the community and decisionmakers. Understanding risk is more than natural hazard risk, it includes the full spectrum of shocks and stresses, including financial, organisational, biological and technological threats, as well as opportunities for Greater Christchurch to achieve its aspirational goals, in particular prosperity. Improved understanding and acceptance of risk will improve the ability to manage risk and decisions around this, empowering individuals to make decisions.\nACTION 9A\nACTION 9B\nDevelop and agree objective risk evidence and definitions in a non-technical language as starting points to engage the community about risks they face.\nWhat will we be doing? Our councils and government agencies will continue to work together to develop and gather an objective base of evidence about the risks we face, being open about the origin of data and assumptions that are used. In developing this resource, methodologies, data collection and analysis will be subject to robust peer review and challenge. A non-technical community focused review will take perspectives from a broad community viewpoint to frame subsequent debate using widely-understood language.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see?\nAccepted baseline sources of information about areas of risk that councils and Central Government can draw from; community confidence in and a firm understanding of risk; recognition of different perspectives about levels of risk acceptance.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022 Canterbury Geotechnical Database\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nCanterbury Natural Hazard Risk Reduction Group\nLEAD: Canterbury Regional Council\nOngoing\n(NB. The implementation plan\ncontains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nOpenly engage the community to explore risk scenarios as a foundation for dialogue about risk reduction.\nWhat will we be doing? We will engage with communities so that people can understand their vulnerability to shocks and stresses, showing people realistic scenarios of how particular hazards might affect them. This information will be confronting and may cause anxiety, but only with such information can households and communities have meaningful discussions around risk management and what risk acceptance actually means.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see?\nOpen and transparent engagement with people using understandable information to help them make decisions and balance the consequences of action or inaction in relation to risk management (explored under Programme 10) and preparedness and resilience.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022 Dudley Creek and Flockton Basin Flood Mitigation Schemes\nMANAGE THE RISKS WE FACE\nExisting and emerging threats impose risks on our communities, our infrastructure, our economy and our environment. Having understood these threats, making decisions about how we can manage risk can be challenging. Many decisions will be personal - threats to life, job security, level of stress. For others, particularly organisations, the main approaches used involve managing the financial risk of uncertainty. Spending money on protective mechanisms (from engineering works to stockpiling vaccines) to reduce the consequences of an event is a cost. For unlikely events this can be very expensive and may sit lower in lists of priorities for funding. But, for higher frequency events where the disruption and recovery costs are greater, a more balanced economic case can be made. This influences how\nmuch we avoid or adapt to mitigate to protect ourselves.\nThere is uncertainty around the availability and cost of natural disaster insurance in the future. Following the earthquakes insurance policies have changed which may result in lower rates of cover (in California only 10% of residential properties have earthquake cover) and incomplete cover which will have consequential implications for recovery from future events.\nAcross the range of risks that people and communities in Greater Christchurch face, the steps we can take to manage risk are important to how we live our lives, go about our business and plan for the future. Where risks remain, building resilience into our homes, business and urban\nareas is the way we can be prepared to face challenges and change.\nResilience Value\nPlanning to avoid, manage and mitigate risks from threats and hazards helps us maintain a stable economy, thriving communities and healthy environments. We cannot eliminate all the risks we face and must accept that in some cases, responses to future events might compromise the value we place on our current quality of life. Transferring risk and being prepared for the impact of an event, forecasted or unexpected, sudden or gradual, is the key to resilience. If these tools cannot reduce risk to acceptable levels then we need to make bold decisions for our future to avoid loss of life and livelihoods.\nACTION 10A\nACTION 10B\nACTION 10C\nDevelop a risk reduction framework to help us invest efficiently in interventions around our threats and hazards.\nWhat will we be doing? Led by\ncouncils and government agencies, we will develop risk reduction projects and programmes to feed into conversations with affected communities that highlight the compromises involved in managing risk. Stop-banks, stormwater pumping, seismic land strengthening and flood storage basins are examples where innovation continues to evolve, and there are opportunities to trial projects. We will draw knowledge from international experience including cities within the 100RC network. Where necessary, councils will look to put in place urban design responses that can be included today to cope with tomorrow, and regulation that ensures we avoid particular land uses in vulnerable locations, and standards to improve the safety and adaptability of structures will be pursued.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Well-framed risk reduction projects and initiatives are developed and proposed to help communities understand the options available to offset risk. In extreme cases, the range of options available may not be cost-effective to implement.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tEstablishment of District Plan standards around minimum floor heights for new buildings in flood-prone areas\n\u2022\tIncrease in Building Code seismic standards\n\u2022\tDudley Creek and Flockton Basin Flood Mitigation Schemes\nReview the role and use of insurance as a tool for risk transfer.\nWhat will we be doing? With central government and council leadership, we will work together to inform the right balance of risk mitigation and risk transfer that keeps insurance premiums in an affordable range. Information and education about the value and types of insurance is also important to help people understand the extent to which they can protect their interests. This is particularly important for the small business sector.\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? The ongoing availability of understandable and affordable insurance products that give people clear understanding of how their interests are protected. In areas of higher risk, premiums may increase but insurance products with exclusions may still be appropriate for those able to accept particular risks.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022 covered.org.nz - insurance industry education resource for consumers\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nResilience Scorecards LEAD: Councils\nTo Develop (1-2 years)\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nSupport community\npreparedness in response to acceptance of risk.\nWhat will we be doing? We will encourage communities to get involved with planning for how they can be more resilient to respond to disruptive events. Civil Defence will continue to provide advice, while information and updates to recommendations on emergency supplies will continue to be issued to make whanau and businesses more resilient and adaptable. There are links to the neighbourhood and community building actions in Programme 1 (Connect People) and Programme 4 (Build Participation).\nWhat outcomes do we expect to see? Communities understand the consequences of various events and know what to do whatever the event, including drawing on assistance from their immediate community and insurers.\nSuccessful current examples of activities include:\n\u2022\tSelwyn gets ready\n\u2022\tCanterbury Civil Defence and Emergency Management (CDEM)\n\u2022\tCollaboration for Business Resilience\nInitial committed projects identified in the Implementation Plan\nCommunity Level Resilience Planning\nLEAD: Councils and Civil Defence\nOngoing\n(NB. The implementation plan contains other proposed projects and ideas to be developed)\nRISK TERMINOLOGY\nRisk reduction draws together the measures we can take to limit our exposure to hazards or the impact of hazards should they affect us. There are three sub-strategies within this broad area.\nAVOIDANCE\nnot taking a particular course of action in response to the risks faced\nMANAGEMENT\naccepting the risks that are there and modifying the way in which we do things to reduce our exposure or the impact of them\nMITIGATION\nconscious investment in measures that, if called upon, will protect, absorb or offset exposure of\npeople to the impacts of known risks\nRisk transfer is a form of risk reduction mitigation (typically in the form of insurance or contingency funding) that addresses the aftermath of an event rather than addressing the cause, but is important in underpinning our resilience.\nThe New Zealand Earthquake Commission (EQC) scheme underpins the availability of affordable insurance for residential property and assets in New Zealand. As a result around 70% of losses from the major earthquake events of the Canterbury Earthquake Series were covered. This compares to 20-30% in Japanese and Chilean earthquake events in 2010 and 2011, and 35% for the last major US earthquake at Northridge in 1994. Costed premiums will reflect the level of risk in the knowledge that losses suffered will be equivalently compensated.\nRisk acceptance is a state of being that influences the level of risk reduction and risk transfer, and ultimately the level of preparedness, we are willing to invest in and it can change as we use other responses.\nPreparedness describes the everyday steps we can take to bounce back from the impacts of an event in the knowledge that risk reduction cannot insulate us from all magnitudes of hazards, and that insurance will not be able to help us during and in the immediate aftermath of an event.\nSECURING OUR FUTURE IN THE\nEASTERN PARTS OF CHRISTCHURCH\nThe population of Eastern Christchurch faces a range of challenging socio-economic issues including poorer educational attainment, below average incomes, higher levels of people on state benefits and poor quality social housing. The 2011 earthquake hit this area the hardest. Ground shaking led to widespread liquefaction and subsidence resulting in 6.3 square kilometres becoming so damaged that the government had to step in and buy nearly 7,300 homes.\nSecuring our future in the eastern parts of Christchurch will require a\nmulti-party collaboration to resolve a range of different issues that include social and economic problems, future risks from climate change, particularly sea level rise and the reuse of earthquake damaged land, and water management. Our response needs to consider the cost as well as the potential benefits for the community.\nResilience Value\nThis programme represents a meeting point of all the goals and programmes contained within the Resilient Greater Christchurch Plan. The future of Eastern Christchurch will be founded\nupon a clear understanding of the risks that the area faces and from there a participative process can best determine how hazards are managed, new prosperity is built and how existing and new communities are connected.\nKey strands of activity are summarised under each of the four themes of narrative below around which this plan's goals are framed.\nEastern Christchurch is a substantial area of the city lying between the Central City and the coast. These pages highlight some of the threats and challenges that the area faces.\nLAND ELEVATION\nThe elevation bands shown on the adjacent map are not hazard zones and should not be interpreted as such. This mapping may aid in identifying areas at risk as the sea rises. Local characteristics, such as coastal landforms or transport corridor embankments will influence the extent of areas at risk.\nSource: Preparing New Zealand for rising seas: Certainty and Uncertainty. Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (November 2015).\nSince 2011 the worst affected areas\nin eastern Christchurch have been\nthe subject of intervention by the\nGovernment. Homes on damaged land have been bought up and demolished leaving once flourishing riverside\ncommunities as vacant land with\nroads and garden trees being the only residual features.\nGroups within the community\nhave already taken the initiative in\ndeveloping ideas for the future of\nthese areas. These include:\n\u2022 opportunities to integrate the river(s) and the ocean into the urban environment as part of a strategy to adapt to sea level rise\n\u2022 large scale visitor attractions\/ water-based sporting venues\n\u2022 community-led plans and placemaking initiatives\n\u2022 resilience demonstration projects\nIn 2015, the Government and the Mayor committed to a new regeneration phase in for the city where more collaborative planning for the future would focus on building back places for people rather than just buildings.\nTo drive this a new entity, Regenerate Christchurch, was created in April 2016.\nReflecting this context, actions\nunder this programme are the least\ndeveloped in this plan. During 2016\/17, the newly formed Regenerate Christchurch will set out it initial list of priorities and projects which the living Implementation Plan (at the back of this document) will pick up.\nThe governance structure put in place for Regenerate Christchurch is consistent with this plan's principle around driving consistency and collaboration across tiers of government.\nRegenerate Christchurch is a body established by the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act 2016 and jointly funded by the Crown and Christchurch City Council.\nOverseen by an appointed board, it has a lifespan of five years, following which it may become a wholly City Council\nentity. Its purpose is to support a vibrant, thriving Christchurch that has economic, social and lifestyle opportunities for residents, businesses visitors, investors and developers.\nIts objectives are to lead the regeneration of Christchurch City by engaging\neffectively with communities, stakeholders and decision-makers to achieve its\npurpose. In doing so it will work collaboratively with other organisations to achieve regeneration outcomes.\nIts functions are to develop visions, strategies and Regeneration Plans to assist\nin achieving regeneration. It will provide advice to the Minister on planning\ninstruments and changes, be an independent source of advice on regeneration\nactivities to the City Council and the Minister and also facilitate increased\ninvestment. Regenerate Christchurch will also comment on regeneration\noutcomes, interventions and the contributions of Otakaro Limited and\nDevelopment Christchurch Limited, giving them (and other organisations) advice on regeneration outcomes being sought.\nThe future of Eastern Christchurch is a key area of focus for Papatipu Runanga. The majority of residential red zone land within Greater Christchurch sits beside waterways that have significant cultural value for local Ngai Tahu. This programme therefore sits at the heart of the principle of building a meaningful Treaty\npartnership with Ngai Tahu.\nOne longstanding issue for Papatipu Runanga relates to the taking of the Te Ihutai (Maori Reserve 900) fishing easement in 1956 in order to build the city's waste water treatment facility (see New Zealand Gazette, 1956, pp 364, 1179). The reserve and its fishery was considered so valuable that the owners would not accept the money offered by the Crown in consideration for its loss. The natural resources of Christchurch's wetlands and waterways were once so rich that there were seven significant pre-European settlements scattered strategically along the Otakaro\/Avon River and its tributaries. The development of the Christchurch Residential Redzone presents an unprecedented opportunity to protect and enhance these habitats and species such that they may once again feed local communities and reinforce this \u2018cornerstone' of local culture.\nHow will our Resilience Goals influence this programme?\n43% of households renting compared with 35% in the city overall\n50% fewer households with access to a motor vehicle than the rest of the city\nCONNECT\nThe sense of community is strong in many eastern parts of Christchurch.\nAny decisions about the future need to involve its people, whether they are long-established, have temporarily moved away or are new to the area. Preparing people to participate in\na process of large-scale change is critical to mobilising their input and building their ownership in a better future.\n1 in 5\nChristchurch residents live in the East\nPARTICIPATE\n0\n42% of the Samoan speakers and 32% of the city's Maori language\nspeakers\nPeople in eastern communities have differing views and perspectives. There are highly circumspect communities who have been promised positive change over the years but have not seen it. In contrast there are highly motivated communities, willing to work together to deliver projects and safeguard the way of life their communities want. The challenge across the area is to openly set expectations with the community, and where capacity and capability exists or emerges, use that drive and energy to build ownership of issues and projects.\nPROSPER\nUNDERSTAND\nEconomic regeneration of the east, specifically through the Otakaro\/Avon River Corridor out to New Brighton, will depend upon exploiting the opportunities that are now available -not least the available, although damaged, red-zoned land and the multi-agency commitment to regeneration. The two strands of making new and relevant connections to people across Greater Christchurch as well as visitors from New Zealand and overseas, combined with fostering an environment that attracts innovation and new ideas, are particularly valid for the future of this area.\nEastern Christchurch, perhaps more than any other part of urbanised Greater Christchurch, is exposed to multiple hazards. The level of risk from those hazards will vary from sudden and extreme inundation from relatively rare tsunami events, to very real projections of sea level rise expected in the next 50-100 years. The level of risk able to be managed through different building standards and mitigation, the level of insurance that people have access to, or areas we may need to retreat from are all issues that will shape the future for the area.\n18km of Avon-Otakaro river\t10% slower business and employment growth since 2000\tOver 1,900\tIn 2013, 80% of Christchurch's most socially deprived people lived within Eastern Christchurch\nand 443 hectares\t\tproperties protected\t\nof residential\t\tby approximately\t\nred zone land\t\t10km of temporary\t\n\t\tstopbanks\t\nCanterbury Natural Hazard\nRisk Reduction Group\nThe Canterbury Natural Hazard Risk Reduction Group was formed in 2016 to develop and implement a regional approach to managing natural hazard risk in Canterbury. In developing a regional approach to managing natural hazard risks, the Group will consider matters around facilitating communication on hazards, co-ordination of information-sharing, exploring opportunities to reduce hazard risk and identification of tools that can result in reduction of hazards in Canterbury.\nCollaboration for Business Resilience\nFollowing a disaster, businesses need to stay in business and keep contributing to the economic and social wellbeing of their local communities. Once this is achieved, they may also be able to assist the wider community's recovery by providing goods, services, facilities, skills or other resources. As the Canterbury recovery has progressed, the many different ways businesses can contribute have become evident.\nResilient New Zealand was formed by a group of like-minded organisations who want to help make New Zealand more resilient to natural disasters. Members of Resilient New Zealand include: BECA, BNZ, IAG, New Zealand Red Cross, and VODAFONE. Resilient New Zealand aims to encourage businesses to embed resilience in their existing planning structures and practices so they are better able to contribute to recovery. Resilient New Zealand is also aiming to work with central and local government to develop governance frameworks that enable the capabilities, resources and people of businesses to be better utilised in a recovery.\nResilient New Zealand's first project, Contributing More: Improving the Role of Business in Recovery (2015), looks at how businesses can:\n\u2022\timprove their own resilience and contribute towards community resilience\n\u2022\tplay a greater leadership role in recovery\n\u2022\tcollaborate with other parties to better enable recovery.\nThe report draws on discussions with more than 50 business, central and local government, and community leaders involved in the Canterbury earthquake recovery and highlights a number of lessons on business resilience, leadership in recovery and collaboration. It also includes recommendations to both the public and private sector on how they can help facilitate businesses contributing more to future natural disaster recoveries. Initially, the report will be used to engage with a range of stakeholders to publicise their findings and to promote their recommendations. Where possible, Resilient New Zealand would like to work in partnership with organisations to implement their recommendations.\nCanterbury Civil Defence Emergency\nManagement (CDEM) Group\nCanterbury CDEM is a partnership of local authorities, emergency services and other organisations tasked with ensuring the effective delivery of civil defence emergency management in Canterbury. As well as preparing and co-ordinating responses, CDEM is tasked with preparing a Group Management Plan for the region which includes monitoring and evaluation of risks and hazards as well as delivering information and education to the public.\nOpawaho Heathcote River Network\nOpawaho Heathcote River Network is working to enhance and restore the whole of Opawaho-Heathcote River as an ecologically healthy river that people take pride in, enjoy and care for. Since its inception in 2015, the network has worked to connect stakeholders up and down the river to work toward this goal. The network has established sound relationships with other community groups, and has received support from Environment Canterbury and Christchurch City Council. In May 2016 the network co-ordinated (along with the Ihutai Estuary Trust and the Otakaro-Avon River Network) the first whole-of-river clean-up for the entire catchment. Current mid-term activities are focused on building the strength and capacity of the network itself (e.g. developing a charter and a website), mapping potential walkways, and supporting potential ecological restoration projects. This initiative was supported by the LinC (Leadership in Communities) Project in 2015.\nKI TE HOE - LET'S GET TO WORK!\nwith Chief Resilience Officer Mike Gillooly\nEveryone has a role to play in building a Resilient Greater Christchurch\nWe are made up of many proud communities working together to recover from one of New Zealand's worst disasters in modern times. Resilience is what enables people to survive, adapt and thrive in the face of acute shocks and chronic stresses and thriving in these conditions is what offers us so much opportunity. We are an amazing region that is globally connected by sea and air, we have modern hospitals, quality academic institutions, a thriving regional economy grounded in agriculture, manufacturing, IT and tourism. We have many reasons to be optimistic about our future.\nAll participants in the development of this plan have contributed a wealth of expert knowledge and a ready understanding of the drivers and dependencies of factors of resilience. The contribution of the not-for-profit sector to this resilience plan, across all the dimensions of resilience, was recognised at all workshops. Specific issues raised during the development of this plan recognised the need to build a more trusting relationship between communities and decision-makers, nurture existing community networks and support systems and recognise the impact and opportunity that the migrant rebuild workforce brings to Greater Christchurch. Repeatedly, there was overlap of key issues - health, wellbeing, infrastructure, environment, economy and society - as interdependent dimensions of resilience, underpinned by the need for strong and effective leadership. Resilience for Greater Christchurch is a journey, not an end in itself. This plan provides a road map for us continue on the path to building a more resilient future.\nIMPLEMENTATION\nOn the following page is an Implementation Plan which is not fixed.\nThe Implementation Plan contains an initial list of detailed projects and initiatives that actors and networks across Greater Christchurch may pursue in building resilience.\nThe listed projects and initiatives consist of those that were already being planned, could be developed or were identified as opportunities when this plan was being developed. Alongside each are identified actors and networks who will play a key role in delivering specific projects and initiatives.\nThis plan is designed to inspire and encourage people to lead or participate in resiliencebuilding programmes, actions and initiatives. Over coming years the Implementation Plan will be reported on and republished containing new actions and initiatives. This will draw on involvement and engagement with the community identifying how we can all take steps to build our resilience.\nSome new projects will be driven by the Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) and these are identified in the Implementation Plan, along with specific partners and timeframes.\nThe Greater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy Partnership will oversee the implementation of the wider plan while also leading some of the projects themselves. The partners are committed to leveraging and maximising existing sources of funding to achieve resilience benefits, including the estimated NZ$40 billion of post-earthquake reinvestment that will go into our infrastructure, buildings and urban environments.\nLEARNING FROM THE OTHER CITIES IN THE NETWORK\nOne of the benefits of our membership of the 100 Resilient Cities network is our ability to not only share what we have learned but also to learn from others. In this plan we have highlighted a number of cites with whom we share common goals and challenges. As we progress into implementation we will look to other cities in the network like Melbourne which has established \u201cThe Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office\u201d to oversee the implementation of the Resilient Melbourne Strategy, and San Francisco which has established an Office of Resilience and Recovery, both tangible examples of initiatives being led by their own Chief Resilience Officer.\nGETTING INVOLVED\nThe aim is that most of the new projects from here onwards are derived from community-level action, including ideas from individuals. Only by learning how we can help ourselves and others can we learn to become resilient.\nA starting point for assistance and advice is our Chief Resilience Officer.\nThe Chief Resilience Officer will advocate for co-ordination across the Urban Development Strategy partners, broker solutions with different organisations, draw on technical support resources, negotiate funding and work directly with community representatives helping to develop and sustain initiatives.\nContact the Chief Resilience Officer if there are programmes, actions or new initiatives that you, your whanau, your community or your organisations could lead or have a role in.","ENTITIES":{"PERSON":["Ngai Tahu Why","Maori","Rolleston","Ngai Tahu Ngai Tahu","Kaiapoi","Kairaki","Dudley Creek","JUDITH RODIN","Kate

cities like ours are becoming the economic, social and cultural backbone of our countries. This represents an opportunity to lead the way like never before - but it also comes with challenges.\nHere in New Zealand\u2019s capital we\u2019ve had our fair share, and we know that our future holds more.\nSome - like earthquakes and sea level rise - have a measure of predictability. While we don\u2019t know when they might happen, we do know what the effects will look and feel like. We\u2019ve seen them before, often very close to home. For example, I believe we owe it to the people of Christchurch to take what we can from what their city has been through over the last 6 years.\nBut along with the more predictable challenges, there are shocks and stresses we don\u2019t yet know about.\nWhat we do know is that resilient communities will pull together in times of adversity, while also having better lives each and every day.\nWe also know there are things we can do today that will pay back exponentially when the time comes. Some things are simple, like getting to know your neighbours, but others are more complex, like investing in housing and transport frameworks to make them efficient and robust. By preparing now, we\u2019re making sure we can rise to meet the challenges in the future.\nThis strategy lays out a coherent blueprint for dealing with future shocks and stresses. Some of the plans we have are short term and tactical; others are longer term and more strategic in nature. All of them have people at the centre.\nHe aha te mea nui o te ao? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata.1\nIn recent years climate experts, disaster responders and sustainability proponents have come into rare alignment. They agree we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop and invest in a future for Wellington that ensures we will not only survive shocks and stresses, but also thrive afterwards.\nOn behalf of Wellingtonians, present and especially future, I would like to thank 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, for their support, and I would like to thank the many people who contributed to the development of this document.\nI\u2019m privileged to be able to launch Wellington\u2019s inaugural Resilience Strategy.\nTu whare ora.\nKia ora,\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate Mayor Lester and the city of Wellington on the release of your Resilience Strategy. This is a major milestone for the city and lOORC\u2019s partnership with \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest little capital\u201d.\nWellingtonians have had a long history of resilient determination, whether as warriors, or pioneers, creating strong communities in this beautiful but sometimes harsh harbour at the southern tip of the North Island. Potentially destructive earthquakes, rising seas, and the city\u2019s famous winds have kept Wellingtonians acutely aware of their vulnerability and helped hone their famous Kiwi ingenuity.\nWith the strategy, Wellington continues the serious work of ensuring that the city becomes resilient not only to the shocks of earthquakes but also the daily stresses that can be equally destructive, such as social and economic inequality, the physical integrity of the city\u2019s houses, and issues of mental health and addiction that plague too many.\nWellington is changing; its population is growing and becoming more diverse. It is also getting older, and as the city welcomes newcomers who will enrich the city and ensure its vibrant future, this strategy provides for programmes for their employment and integration.\nAs Wellington evolves, it must foster collaboration between its communities, provide access to information and services to all, and ensure meaningful involvement in decision making.\nThis strategy emphasises that trust and collaboration are key - without them, true resilience that takes into account all of Wellington\u2019s voices and concerns cannot be achieved. The ancient Maori legend of Ngake and Whataitai beautifully illustrates the kind of inclusivity and resourcefulness that will support Wellington\u2019s resilience journey in the coming years and beyond.\nLate last year the Kaikoura earthquake drove home the urgency of building this kind of resilience. It also highlighted a major reason why Wellington will undoubtedly be able to do so: Chief Resilience Officer Mike Mendon^a. Mike\u2019s work on the recovery after the earthquake shows he and his team have already begun the work of embedding resilience thinking into how the city manages its shocks and stresses. Rather than trying to defy nature, the Wellington Resilience Strategy seeks to live in tandem with it, using the challenges it poses as opportunities to become even stronger.\nThis document is just the beginning, of course. As the capital city of a progressive nation, we\u2019re looking to you to lead the way nationally and internationally; you\u2019ve already begun to lead by example, and we\u2019ve come to expect nothing less.\nResilient Wellington - a strategy\nFifty years ago, Wellington looked completely different to the way it looks today. It\u2019s unlikely that Wellingtonians of the 1960s could have dreamed of how connected their children and grandchildren would be to each other and the rest of the world - virtually, through massive advances in technology and telecommunications, and physically, through a bustling international airport.\nThey probably wouldn\u2019t have thought that our population would be 13 percent Maori,\n8 percent Pasihka and 8 percent Asian, with more than 80 ethnic groups and dozens of languages spoken on the streets. Nor would they have thought that Wellington could be transformed from a government town into \u201cthe coolest little capital in the world\u201d.\nWhile they might have expected earthquakes to be an ongoing worry, they would not have foreseen traffic congestion, people living rough in the central city, or that the climate would have changed to the point that we need to adapt our city to rising sea levels, and to more intense and frequent flash floods and high winds.\nIn another few decades, people will reflect on our time and wonder at the change that will have occurred between 2017 and 2050.\nThis strategy sets out a blueprint to enable Wellingtonians to better prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions. It is designed to maintain and build on the resilience momentum that has been generated to date. It outlines accountabilities and actions for change - its purpose is to make a positive difference. It is our vision that as Wellington moves and changes, everyone here will survive and thrive.\nThree goals will support this vision: that people are connected, empowered and feel part of a community; decision making is integrated and well informed; and our homes, natural and built environment are healthy and robust. These goals will drive a series of strategic projects designed to shape our future city. Each of the projects signals a need to change from the status quo, such as preparing Wellington to adapt itself to the effects of sea level rise, and integrating recovery planning for the earthquake that we know will strike Wellington.\nIn developing this strategy, 200 people including infrastructure managers, researchers, community members, businesses and council staff from across the Wellington region imagined themselves in the shoes of their children and grandchildren in 35 years\u2019 time.\nWhat will be the shocks and stresses they are likely to encounter, and what can we do today so that their lives - and ours - can be improved? How can we be Resilient Wellington?\nTo help bring these likely experiences to life, we developed a \u2018resilience story\u2019 through a series of stakeholder workshops. The story follows a fictional family as they grapple with life in Wellington over the coming decades.\nThe story provided an inspiration and a test environment for a series of accelerated design workshops, where the actions that form this strategy have been developed, building on Wellington\u2019s strengths.\nWe developed the strategy using four principles: to co-design wherever possible, to accelerate design, to use a strengths based approach, and to use story telling to communicate the resilience agenda.\nThe process allowed Wellingtonians to define resilience for their own city, and to come up with the most important areas for investment. This was no easy task, as it quickly became clear that the word resilience means different things to different people. It was very important to build\non experiences around the world and to understand what resilience means for Wellington. Once there was a common understanding, it became much easier to challenge the status quo, and to focus on the areas and initiatives that could really make a difference.\nCity Resilience Framework\nThe City Resilience\nFramework (CRF), developed\nby Arup and The Rockefeller\nFoundation, identifies 12\ndrivers of resilient cities\nacross the areas of health\nand wellbeing, economy\nand society, infrastructure\nand environment, and\nleadership and strategy.\nWe used this tool to assess\nthe completeness of our\ncurrent initiatives and\nunderstand various city\nsystems\u2019 ability to cope\nwith shocks and stresses.\nWe also used it to ensure\nwe had a representative\nsample of people and\norganisations contributing\nto the development of the\nstrategy. The tool enabled\nus to broaden thinking in\nWellington beyond disaster\npreparedness and recovery\nand ensure that the initiatives\nidentified will make the\nbest ongoing contribution to\nbuilding the city's resilience.\nReading this strategy\nThis strategy is about change. Current and future changes to the ocean, land and our society will drive our decisions.\nThis strategy is divided in two parts\nOur resilience story\nOur resilience story tells how we coped with challenges in the past and how we hope to in the future, and sets the vision for Resilient Wellington.\nChapter 1\nLooking back.\nChapter 2\n2020s - Our society is transforming.\nChapter 3\n2030s - The earth is moving.\nChapter 4\n2040s - The sea is rising.\nOur goals and programmes\nWe also provide further detail on our goals and individual programmes, the challenges they aim to address, and the specific actions we are planning.\nGoall\nPeople are connected, empowered and feel part of a community.\nGoal 2\nDecision making at all levels is integrated and well informed.\nGoal 3\nOur homes and natural and built environments are healthy and robust.\nMany of the events in the story are the drivers behind our three goals and the actions contained in this strategy. Look out for our characters in the goals and programmes sections to see how the story and actions connect. Relevant project numbers are highlighted throughout the story.\nOur Resilient Wellington vision is that:\nAs Wellington changes, everyone here will survive and thrive.\nWellington's resilience challenges originate from three big systems on the move.\nOur society is transforming.\nWellington\u2019s population is growing. It is getting older, more diverse and less equitable. Some of our homes, instead of being a source of resilience, are cold, wet and unaffordable. New people are arriving - some will struggle to develop skills and find jobs. Some of our citizens are disconnected from society, living on the streets at the mercy of their mental health issues or substance addictions. Communities and the public and private sectors must share information, trust one another, and work together more effectively to develop a better resilience culture.\nThe earth is moving in Wellington.\nA significant seismic event is inevitable. Current efforts are focussed on saving lives but our buildings will be damaged and it will take time before we can use them again. The energy, transport, water and telecommunications infrastructure that serves our communities, our Government and our business sectors are centralised and vulnerable. Central Wellington generates eight percent of national GDP and 48 percent of regional GDP. If the robustness and integration of knowledge, planning and governance in Wellington isn\u2019t improved, the consequences could be socially and economically significant.\nThe sea is rising.\nExtreme weather is already affecting our coastline and low-lying parts of the city, damaging seawalls and flooding homes. More intense rain and wind will cause more flooding in our streets, land slips on our hills, damage natural and built assets, and increase maintenance costs. We are yet to understand climate change\u2019s physical, financial, cultural and social implications, and how we should adapt. We have many strengths - including a stunning natural environment and insights from Maori culture on integrating human activities with nature - but we must collaborate within Wellington, New Zealand and even globally to find long-term solutions.\nGoall\nPeople are connected, empowered and feel part of a community\nOur connections in the community provide us with informal support and shared resources, such as locally grown food, car pooling options, and opportunities to socialise. As our city grows and our systems are stretched, people in communities that are cohesive and empowered will be better able to support each other through disasters, as well as thrive in the face of everyday challenges.\nProgramme 1.1\tp. 42\nEveryone thrives\nWe will enable all Wellingtonians to have an opportunity to enhance wellbeing for themselves and their communities.\nProgramme 1.2\tp. 48\nCommunity resilience\nWe will build on existing strengths to develop innovative programmes that connect and empower communities to improve their wellbeing.\nProgramme 1.3\tp. 56\nEconomic resilience\nWe will support our business community to improve preparedness and strengthen our economic activity.\nProgramme 1.1\nEveryone thrives\nWe will enable all Wellingtonians to have an opportunity to enhance wellbeing for themselves and their communities.\nWhile most Wellingtonians\nhave high levels of education and income, there are pockets of severe deprivation with high support needs and more limited access to services. Maori, Pasihka and refugee populations are over-represented in these areas. We are also not comfortable with the number of people living rough on our streets in recent years.\nThis sort of inequality can be a self-fulfilling cycle that entrenches existing disadvantage. Due to increasing pressures on housing affordability, people on lower incomes often have to settle for cold and damp housing in areas with limited access to public transport and other essential services. These factors can contribute to poorer health, reinforcing existing economic\ndeprivation and social isolation through reduced ability to work, and lower capacity to be prepared for disruptive events.\nWellington\u2019s population is also ageing - by 2030 the number of people over 65 will double. This will place increased pressure on our healthcare system and aged care support services, and there will be a smaller percentage of working aged people to fund these services through taxes. We need to reassess how our infrastructure, including housing and our transport system, supports the needs of older residents. Employers will need to prepare for a higher percentage of older workers. Wellington\u2019s ethnic mix and skills pool are also changing but we have even less information on that.\nWellington is in an area prone to a range of acute shocks. Our essential services are vulnerable to disruption, meaning that Wellingtonians need to take greater responsibility for their preparedness and ability to ensure their basic needs are met. At present, many Wellingtonians may be unable to access household items and services that can improve their resilience. Some may not be able to afford them, while others may not have access to them due to lack of awareness, physical isolation, or language barriers.\nLead\nWCC and WREMO\nScaling up existing regional project\nWe will improve access to household items that enhance preparedness and recovery, ensuring that all Wellingtonians can survive in their own home for at least the first 7 days after a major shock event.\nAction\nThis project will promote and scale up existing education programmes, services and products such as household water tanks, items for urban agriculture and Grab&Go bags. In addition, we will explore partnership opportunities with the private sector around new, affordable products that improve personal preparedness for shock events and improve day-to-day wellbeing, such as home kits to secure house foundations, and partnerships with nurseries to supply fruit trees and other produce that can be grown at home. The project will also investigate how to reduce cost barriers to access these products through subsidisation and private sector involvement. Other barriers will be considered too - we will partner with local trusted networks (for example, community groups and elders) to broaden the reach into more communities.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project will build the capacity of vulnerable Wellingtonians to support themselves in the event of a shock (Project 18). Resilience resources will increase community confidence and also benefit Wellingtonians outside times of shock, improving social cohesiveness and reducing inequality (Project 4).\nLead\nKey\npartners\nWCC\tWREMO, Universities, Office for Seniors\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will plan our transport, housing, health system and social spaces to enable our ageing population to fully participate and contribute to the economic and social life of our city.\nAction\nThe Council will host a symposium to discuss and share existing local efforts and international best practice in approaches to catering for ageing populations. It will bring together people from a wide range of backgrounds including senior and youth associations, health sector, sport and aged care industry, as well as architects, transport and urban planners. Topics will include examples from other 100RC cities and the WHO Global Network of Age Friendly Cities and Communities.\nThe symposium will be followed by a research project and spatial mapping of existing services for seniors and a loneliness index. The project will provide recommendations for changes required to prepare for a larger aged population.\nA multiagency steering group is proposed to oversee the project.\nResilience co-benefits\nAs a result of this project, our aged population will, over time, have access to more suitable housing, mobility options and healthcare. The project will focus on enabling this growing subset of our community to contribute actively to the economic (Projects 8,10) and social life (Projects 4, 5) of our city, thus generating benefits for us all. Applying universal design principles will make our housing and open spaces more flexible and inclusive (Project 20). This will also ensure seniors are able to cope in an emergency as well as to provide support for others.\nBy better integrating seniors into society we will enhance their ability to cope in an emergency as well as provide support for others.\nInspiration from the 100RC Network\n- Homes4Bnstol\nRather than searching for the elusive \u2018silver bullet\u2019 solution to homelessness, Bristol has settled on a mature and realistic mix of approaches to combat what is invariably a complex problem.\nBristol is building on already successful programmes (such as better use of otherwise empty homes) to combat homelessness.\nThe city is now investing in early intervention and better co-ordinated social services to prevent homelessness in the first place, with a particular focus on youth. At the same time, Bristol deals assertively with the existing problem. This is supported by analysis that reinforces co-benefits to healthcare and other policy areas if homelessness can be prevented in the first place. There is further focus on making it easy for people to move on as soon as they are ready, and to prevent repeat homelessness.\nWellington will continue to look to Bristol and other parts of the 10 ORC network to combat homelessness.\no\nReduce homelessness\nLead\nwcc\nKey partners\nHousing New Zealand, Te Whakamura Ai te Ahi\nScaling up existing city project\nWe will reduce street homelessness in Wellington and integrate the most vulnerable people into society by enabling access to housing and partnering with health, social services and other support agencies.\nAction\nTe Mahana is a community driven strategy to reduce homelessness in Wellington. Given that Maori are over-represented in those experiencing homelessness, the strategy has been built with strong Maori input, providing a cultural perspective on homelessness, which is essential to changing outcomes for Maori in this area. The work of Resilient Wellington has identified that the additional success of this strategy will require greater investment and focus. The programme will be expanded so that frontline staff can work one-on-one with homeless people -this project will provide funding and training for these staff.\nResilience co-benefits\nAs well as building greater awareness of the challenge posed by homelessness in Wellington, this project will give more of our citizens a chance to be self-sufficient and an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to our communities (Projects 4,10,18).\nProgramme 1.2\nCommunity resilience\nWe will build on existing strengths to develop innovative programmes that connect and empower communities to improve their wellbeing.\nResilient cities are integrated\nand resourceful. They harness connections between systems and institutions to generate multiple benefits, seeking better ways to use existing resources. At the core of these principles is sharing - something most Wellingtonians do regularly. We have a number of start-ups related to car sharing and communal gardens, and we have realised the benefits of shared spaces for innovative thinking through initiatives such as the BizDojo community space and Urban Agriculture programme.\nThis idea of sharing is nothing new to Maori, for whom manaakitanga2 and papakainga3 are traditional values. These values came to the fore in the response and recovery phases of the Canterbury earthquakes. Marae\nfacilities around the country, including Wellington, were opened up to the whole community for accommodation, catering and support. Maori communities were among the hardest hit by the earthquakes, and marae became a central hub for the Maori response and recovery.\nFollowing the earthquakes, the marae network wasn\u2019t just about buildings and facilities. It was as much about leadership and governance - leaders with the autonomy to act quickly within an existing chain of command. These same attributes will be critical in addressing Wellington\u2019s next major shock and chronic stresses.\nWellington\u2019s changing size and demographics require us to think differently about how we design and use\nour urban areas and common spaces. A key part of this will be multi-purpose places that enable safe gathering during or immediately after a shock, drive social connections and innovation every day, and provide a location for shared and distributed infrastructure.\nIf these spaces are to meet the needs of our communities, we\u2019ll need to forge meaningful partnerships to understand their diverse and evolving needs, ensuring they are actively involved in decisions around new spaces and infrastructure. While neighbourhoods will always be important, it\u2019s also about engaging with communities of interest, as well as virtual communities who connect online.\nLead\nKey partners\nWCC,WREMO\tCommunities, Neighbours Day Aotearoa, NZ\nRed Cross, NZ Post\nScaling up existing regional and Wellington City projects\nWe will develop and grow innovative programmes that empower communities to increase people\u2019s wellbeing and emergency preparedness, connecting them to each other and their city.\nAction\nThis project builds on existing engaged and connected communities, as well as current community resilience programmes. It will be run in two streams coordinated by the Council and WREMO.\nThe Council will expand the #wellynextdoor programme and, with the community, develop a series of events in streets and apartment buildings. It will also expand the existing participatory, place-based, co-design approach to community planning used in Strathmore Park and Newtown to develop similar projects in other communities in the future. The team will identify opportunities to develop new community spaces, such as community dojos, where a range of people and organisations can use the space to increase social connection and cohesion. All of these places need to be included in disaster planning as alternative shelter and work spaces. We will explore options to make funding accessible to groups and organisations that may not be legal entities.\nWREMO will scale up its community response and resilience planning with councils throughout the region to expand opportunities to address community vulnerabilities and incorporate urban planning at the neighbourhood level. They will work with local leaders to build on their existing strengths and develop tailored community-led initiatives. WREMO, with support from key partners, will be offering emergency preparedness training and community preparedness workshops with schools, businesses, NGOs and residents. This will include a new Community Leadership module that will focus on helping local leaders direct their communities through change and times of stress.\nThe two streams of work are complementary, and a collaborative, participative approach to their design and delivery activities will be taken. They will also link the initiatives with wider planning frameworks.\nResilience co-benefits\nEngaged and empowered communities are at the heart of Wellington\u2019s resilience. This project builds further opportunities for neighbours to meet and make changes to their community that improve their day-to-day wellbeing, while at the same time developing connections and collaboration skills that are essential in emergencies. The project will support flexible and inclusive local initiatives with specialist knowledge and resources. The Council and WREMO will ensure the initiatives are coordinated at a regional level and are well connected to urban planning and other city functions.\nIncreased community investment in neighbourhoods will lead to healthier and safer communities, generating education and employment opportunities and improving day-to-day wellbeing.\nThis project relates strongly to action on household resilience (Project 1), community spaces (Project 5), new economic hubs (Project 8) and climate action (Project 17).\nLead\nKey partners\nSupport community spaces in taking on wellbeing and post-disaster roles\nWCC,WREMO\tCommunities, Victoria University School\nof Architecture and Design\nScaling up a Wellington City project\nWe will optimise new and existing multi-purpose spaces where communities can interact in good times, as well as after emergency events.\nAction\nDrawing on WREMO\u2019s community response planning and the Council\u2019s urban development process, the project team will work with land use planners, infrastructure owners, iwi and businesses to draw greater benefits from multipurpose spaces in Wellington.\nThe project team will build on existing work by Victoria University of Wellington School of Architecture and Design to expand their research on the city\u2019s open space network for post-disaster housing, economic continuity, education and healthcare provision. The team will undertake an assessment to identify the potential for new and existing spaces such as parks, gardens, community dojos, offices and cultural venues to be developed or redeveloped to incorporate a disaster resilience component (such as water sources, food production, electricity, shelter and so on) while enhancing them to maximise their contribution to community wellbeing. A special focus will be given to providing space for volunteers. Ensuring these spaces are accessible to vulnerable Wellingtonians, such as the elderly, ill and recent arrivals, will be a key consideration in this process. Enabling local communities to be part of the design\/redesign of those spaces is also critical to ensure they meet evolving needs.\nThese places will be the key locations for back-up power and water supply as well as for storage of maintenance and emergency supplies.\nResilience co-benefits\nAll Wellingtonians have the opportunity to benefit from this project. Rethinking our existing open and community spaces so they can serve multiple purposes supports the quality of resourcefulness - seeking to do more with what we have, sometimes at little additional cost (Project 6 and 24). When well designed, those new or redeveloped spaces will provide people with enhanced opportunities to connect and collaborate in good times (Project 4), build valuable knowledge and networks (Project 8) (like skills or resources to help recovery), as well as enable people to self-organise more easily in the event of a major disaster.\nThose spaces will play a major role in ensuring people have access to basic services - food, water, shelter, warmth and so on - soon after a major disruptive event (Project 18).\nLead\nDevelop sustainable food networks\nKey partners\nWCC\tFood distribution network, Sustainability Trust\nScaling up a Wellington City project\nWe will develop a sustainable food network building on current initiatives and creating new programmes that meet social and health needs as well as ensuring a robust food distribution network post emergency event.\nAction\nThe Council will expand its current urban agriculture programme to map and connect existing community food projects. We will identify partnership opportunities with groups targeting child obesity, type 2 diabetes, families in need, marae, mental health, seniors, refugees, and prisons to develop new community gardening projects. We will also identify communities in need and establish coordinators there to run community garden programmes.\nWe will support the establishment and growth of local food businesses through the Good Food educational and mentoring programme and community funding. We will also explore food distribution models to develop a plan for Wellington in the event of a shock.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project will teach potentially vulnerable Wellingtonians how to grow food for their own use and to establish small businesses. This can support their physical and mental health, wellbeing and provide a new source of income (Projects 1, 2,10). The project provides an opportunity for refugees, aged or other people disconnected from the wider society to integrate back into their neighbourhoods (Project 3).\nIt also makes more local food available in an event where Wellington has reduced connection with the rest of the country (Project 18).\nDevelop disaster risk management plans for heritage areas\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tBuilding owners, MBIE\nScaling up a Wellington City project\nWe will develop risk management plans for selected heritage areas to guide predisaster investment.\nAction\nThis initiative sets out to identify the most highly valued heritage areas, and to formally plan to invest in their resilience.\nThe Government has recognised that unreinforced masonry facades and parapets in Wellington present a risk to public safety, and has allocated funding to mitigate the risk. Many of the relevant buildings are in heritage areas. The Council will use a risk management framework to work with relevant agencies and building owners to better secure these heritage assets.\nWellington is already strengthening earthquake-prone buildings; this initiative will provide prioritisation for funding and the development of guidance for postevent decision making. It will also consider ways disaster resilience investment can improve the use of heritage places.\nResilience co-benefits\nPre-event preparedness will allow robust and considered post-event action, enabling us to better protect our sense of who we are and what we stand for. This project will enable more inclusive management of our heritage. It will be incorporated into wider community resilience building work (Project 4, 5,14).\nInspiration from 100RC network\n- Byblos's approach to managing their heritage\nByblos has dedicated a pillar of its Resilience Strategy to the protection and celebration of its natural and cultural heritage as a catalyst for improved economic development, community engagement, participation and social cohesion. The city worked with Platform Partner Swiss Re to conduct a tsunami simulation on the Old Port after it was damaged by storm Zina in January 2015. Old Port and some older religious buildings have been confirmed to be at risk from coastal flooding. It is predicted that the largest tsunami could create a 6-metre wave in the port area; this type of event has a return period of around 2000 years, while a smaller tsunami of 1-3 metres may re-occur every 300-1000 years. Following the work undertaken, Byblos is developing measures, guidelines and frameworks to protect the city\u2019s historic assets, including developing affordable restoration techniques for property owners to carry out. Training and implementation is being incentivised by loans and tax deductions.\nProgramme 1.3\nEconomic resilience\nWe will support our business community to improve preparedness and strengthen our economic activity.\nOver recent years, Wellington has experienced significant growth in the numbers of people working, living and playing in the central city. This has helped enhance Wellington\u2019s compact urban form, with more people living close to where they work, with easy access to essential services and little need to own a car.\nA major challenge will be continuing to provide access to quality services as the residential population of the central city more than doubles by 2043.\nAs home to New Zealand\u2019s Parliament and Government, higher skilled services and public governance\nservices contribute about two-thirds of Wellington City\u2019s GDP. This leaves us vulnerable to disruptive events such as earthquakes and terrorist attacks.\nAs large tracts of the central city are also vulnerable to inundation in a future affected by sea level rise, there is a strong case to be made for spreading the risk by strengthening our central city at the same time as other commercial centres.\nOver 90 percent of businesses in Wellington have nine or fewer employees. While small can mean agile, small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) can also be especially vulnerable to disruptions to their supply chain and essential services, particularly if they have not planned ahead (Grow Wellington Ltd, 2011). Over the last year, WREMO has run free business continuity planning\nworkshops attended by 120 Wellington businesses. However, this is only a fraction of all businesses in Wellington - among many SMEs there is still limited understanding and uptake of business continuity planning.\nBut building Wellington\u2019s economic resilience is not just about being prepared for disruptive events - it also means better understanding\nwhat segments of our economy will grow and provide future employment. An important element of this work will be partnering with our educational institutions and the private sector to ensure we have the right mix of skills for future industries. This will mean providing opportunities for workers to retrain and upskill for the jobs of the future.\nIncrease economic resilience of central city and outside hubs\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tChambers of Commerce\nNew regional project\nWe will reduce the vulnerability of the central city and improve the capacity of outside hubs to carry out more economic activity.\nAction\nThe Council, in partnership with other councils, business and community groups, will assess the economic resilience of the central city, Karori, Johnsonville, Tawa, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt and Porirua. The product will be a set of recommendations on how to reduce vulnerability in the central city and generate economic opportunities in the hubs.\nResilience co-benefits\nThe central city is both the most productive and the most vulnerable part of Wellington. This project sets out to involve interested parties in a structured way, ensuring inclusiveness with broad consultation and communication; and learning from the positives and negatives from Wellington\u2019s story so far, as well as from Christchurch and overseas (Project 18).\nThe project will improve Wellington\u2019s resilience to major disasters by building economic redundancy throughout the region, but it will also generate an opportunity to diversify our economy and prepare it for future demands and a changing workforce (Projects 8, 5,10).\nThe central city is both the most productive and the most vulnerable part of Wellington. This project aims to build economic redundancy targeting new areas and new industries.\nHelp improve business continuity planning\nLead\tKey partners\nChambers of Commerce\tWCC, WREMO\nScaling up existing regional project\nWe will improve the level of business continuity planning by small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) in Wellington.\nAction\nCurrently, around 100 SMEs per annum participate in the existing WREMO business continuity programme. At little or no cost to businesses, this project aims to improve the reach of the existing WREMO programme by enlisting the support of other agencies, such as the Chambers of Commerce, the Wellington Region Economic Development Agency and the Earthquake Commission, to promote the programme and other opportunities for planning, with a view to 1,000 SMEs per annum participating. The intent is to develop an SME culture where continuity planning, including insurance, even at a rudimentary level, is part of normal business in Wellington. The mode of delivery will be active, with positive engagement on business locations, as well as the current offering.\nResilience co-benefits\nWellington\u2019s business community will be better prepared to face shocks and quickly resume operations following a major disruptive event, such as an earthquake. This will help keep Wellington\u2019s economy ticking over, as well as provide Wellingtonians with access to the services they need.\nBusiness continuity planning will also help SMEs reduce the impact of minor disruptive events (such as equipment failures). The benefits also go beyond preparedness - business continuity planning requires organisations to examine their business process, which can identify opportunities to make operational improvements that increase overall competitiveness and efficiency as well as engagement within the business. This also relates to recovery planning\n(Project 18), connective capacity for working from home (Project 23) and insurance literacy (Project 21).\nIn a disaster it is critical that SMEs can quickly resume their operations. By investing to resilience SMEs will also improve their competitiveness and efficiency.\nImprove\nunderstanding of workforce trends\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tChambers of Commerce\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will work with a range of partners to undertake a study to better understand future workforce trends and investigate ways to prepare for them.\nAction\nWe recognise a resilience challenge for Wellington in relation to changing workforce requirements. The future economy will need different skills and we need to adapt to it. We will undertake a study to better understand this challenge and how we can respond to it. This will include an analysis of short to medium-term economic predictions, the offerings of existing tertiary learning institutions throughout the region, and how existing resources can be better harnessed to capitalise on future opportunities.\nResilience co-benefits\nChanges in the economy and the way products and services are developed are transforming the way we work. This project aims to reduce Wellington\u2019s overreliance on government services and allow the city to take opportunities to diversify the economy. There are clear links with our work on ageing population (Project 2) and economic hubs outside of central city (Project 8).\nProgramme 2.1\nGovernance\nWe will ensure that resilience is integrated into our governance.\nMany Wellington organisations and institutions are implementing programmes aimed at improving the resilience\nof the city and region. While it is important for grassroots programmes to be allowed to flourish without unnecessary administrative burdens,\nthere is a risk that we will miss opportunities for collaboration and co-benefits without appropriate coordination and governance.\nApproximately\nwhich is estimated to have saved Orion\nThe expected growth in our central city will require innovative thinking around service provision. Achieving this will also require innovative governance - rather than thinking first about\ninfrastructure, we will need to support businesses and retailers in talking directly with communities. This will help them to better understand the vulnerability of services and infrastructure that is needed in mainly\napartment-based living, and a service-based economy, as well as coordinate the physical risk management activities of Wellington utility and transport service providers.\nIntroduce regulatory tools (rncludrng enforcement) for resrlrence\nLead\nwcc\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will assess regulatory options to mitigate future liabilities of liquefaction, flooding, sea level rise and other hazards, and to build resilience into our city\u2019s decision making.\nAction\nThe Council will assess possible regulatory responses to improve resilience to the impacts of sea level rise, earthquake, liquefaction, and tsunami, including options to amend land use through the District Plan, building regulation and non-regulatory options to require residents to secure their homes (including chimneys, joists and verandahs), and emergency water storage requirements. Options for supporting wider resilience through regulation will also be explored. The project will include assessment of the economic impact of regulating and not regulating.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project seeks to reflect on the lessons learned from the Christchurch earthquakes and make sure they inform Wellington\u2019s planning. It will prepare the city for both response to and recovery from natural disasters (Project 18), but will also ensure the city continues to learn and innovate during quiet times (Project 5, 20, 24).\nLead\nReview Wellington Lifelines Group\nWellington Lifelines Group\nExisting regional project\nKey partners\nWellington City, Porirua, Lower Hutt councils\nIn partnership with the Wellington Lifelines Group (WeLG), we will better communicate the vulnerabilities of our city\u2019s lifelines to leaders and decision makers in order to prompt and prioritise action.\nAction\nWeLG will coordinate a programme to ensure asset owners are making\nWellington\u2019s decision makers aware of the effect on communities of vulnerabilities in lifelines (power, water, telecommunications and transport in particular), and that the interdependencies of these lifelines is a key focus. This programme will centre on what is required to ensure community needs (such as clean water, sanitation, energy, and communications) are met under all circumstances, which will then inform decision making about infrastructure.\nThe programme will bring Transpower, WWL, WE* and NZTA together with Wellington, Porirua and Lower Hutt councils to assess the vulnerabilities associated with local authorities in our region.\nThe programme will also include analysis of all Wellington infrastructure to provide a clear understanding of the benefits and costs of investing and failing to invest appropriately. It is expected the existing Measuring the Economics of Resilient Infrastructure (MERIT) tool will be used as it is well understood by Treasury, who will be a key player in future investment decisions, but other approaches will also be investigated.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project will help set expectations for decisions makers, while strengthening key relationships with partners. It will help to communicate the risks of living in Wellington and lead to formal commitment from key players. More reflective collaboration and action will in turn lead to more resilient approaches to meeting community needs, including more robust networks. This will result in water, energy, telecommunication and transport services able to withstand significant shocks while enabling communities and economy to thrive every day.\nThe Resilient Wellington initiative has revealed that we do not fully understand the likely economic impacts of a major shock to Wellington. Results from the MERIT study would greatly enhance our understanding of where to focus investment to maximise benefits for disaster resilience. The analysis will also outline the costs and consequences of inaction and failure to invest in resilient homes and infrastructure. WLG will be an essential partner in the recovery planning (Project 18).\nLead\nMaintain monitoring and evaluation of resilience goals\nKey partners\nWCC\tResilient Wellington Steering Group\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will maintain the momentum generated by the strategy development process through a formal governance structure to oversee the implementation and review of the strategy.\nWe will maintain momentum generated in the strategy phase to empower various stakeholders to build resilience into their projects, facilitating ongoing learning and collaboration with the 100RC network.\nAction\nThe Resilient Wellington Steering Group brought together for the development of this strategy will remain in place to oversee strategy implementation and to coordinate resilience efforts across the city.\nSteering Group members will be expected to contribute to robust and constructive discussion to ensure implementation of the strategy is a success. They will consider the progress of each project in regards to timeliness, budget, outcomes and barriers to implementation. Members will also have a public role, acting as champions of Wellington\u2019s resilience and celebrating key achievements with the community and media. The Steering Group is expected to formally report to the Wellington City, Lower Hutt and Porirua councils annually in February.\nWe will link the project to other Wellington governance bodies such as the Joint Committee and the Coordinating Executive Group to ensure integration, good governance and strategic overview.\nIn 2019 the Steering Group will be asked to make recommendations on improvements to the strategy to the Council, including recommendations for adding or removing projects, objectives, shocks and stresses, and other recommendations as members see fit. This is an opportunity to revise the strategy\u2019s approach in light of progress and changes to the local, regional, national and international situation.\nThe Chief Resilience Officer will manage the implementation of the strategy as set out in the Implementation Plan. This will maintain momentum generated in the strategy phase and empower various stakeholders to build resilience into their projects, facilitating ongoing learning and collaboration with the 100RC network.\nResilience co-benefits\nThe Resilient Wellington Steering Group acting as Wellington resilience champions will ensure the strategy is implemented in an efficient and collaborative way, and will ensure that resilience efforts continue in the future.\nThis project will hold key people to account for the resilience tasks they have been allocated. This in turn will provide elected officials and others with the\nassurance and transparency required for good governance.\nInspiration from the 10 ORC network\n- New York Rebuild By Design\nFollowing Superstorm Sandy, the city of New York realised that a shift in thinking was required. A shift away from simply responding to disasters, and towards investing in planning, preparing and designing the City to deal with the disruptions that will be part of the next century.\nThe Rockefeller Foundation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development used the Rebuild By Design competition to achieve a collaborative approach to build resilience into future New York. The process ocussed strongly and deliberately on collaboration, engagement and understanding challenges before starting to contemplate potential solutions. This avoided the temptation to leap to conclusions, and ensured the groundwork was properly completed.\nThe approach was a popular success, and Rebuild By Design is now its own\norganisation, using its design approach to help cities to invest before disasters strike. Mexico City, San Francisco, Rotterdam and others now use the approach for specific planning challenges in their own environments, using ecological and landscape design techniques to address climate related challenges.\nAs Wellington works to understand and respond to vulnerabilities like sea level rise and flooding, we will take heed of Rebuild By Design\u2019s collaborative and visionary approach.\nWellington is not in the business of waiting for disasters and responding to them. Like Rebuild By Design, Wellington is in the business of coming together with communities to invest in smart interventions that benefit people - today and tomorrow.\nProgramme 2.2\nInformation\nWe will make information on all aspects of living in Wellington easily accessible.\nWe hold tremendous amounts of data about our city, but despite this, most Wellingtonians still hnd it hard to access reliable and easy-to-use information to inform key life decisions, such as the earthquake and climate risks of a property they are interested in. This sometimes means Wellingtonians make decisions that place them at heightened risk from disruptive events, which increases the burden on government and community organisations to provide support if this happens.\nWe have some difficult decisions to make, like the future of our coastal properties. We need to improve how we bring our economic, demographic, scientific and other information together to inform decision making and future investments. A key part of this will be using more open-source approaches that empower our residents to make well-informed decisions of their own.\nAs a knowledgeable and creative city, we also have the resources at our disposal to build our resilience in more innovative ways. We can combine these strengths to cater for a range of different audiences and learning styles. For example, creating virtual reality environments to help visualise the impacts of natural hazards and collaborate on solutions, or devising art installations, films and events that encourage creativity and steer action around adaptation and preparedness.\nInspiration from 100RC network\n- The Great Model in Mexico\nMexico City is developing an interactive city model, La Gran Maqueta de la Ciudad de Mexico, which represents a technological leap toward sustainable urban planning for the city. The model allows experts, citizens and the private sector to have a visual and manageable representation of city data, past and present. \u201cThe Great Model\u201d is accompanied by a technological display that explores the complexity of the Mexican capital, its origins, its emotions and its urban evolution. There are also multimedia installations, most of which are interactive and participative; a consultation room; a large format audio-visual installation; the latest generation touch screens; maps; plans; and hundreds of photographs, giving visitors an experience for all the senses. Mexico City is the only city in the country to be a member of C40, so alongside the 100 Resilient Cities programme, they are ahead of the majority with the formation of databases and high regulatory benchmarks aligned to international standards.\nGive Wellingtonians information they need to make decisions\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tNEC\nExisting Wellington City project\nWe will bring together a wide range of data on Wellington and make it available so that citizens, researchers, investors and visitors can use it to make their own decisions and plans.\nAction\nWorking closely with end users and partners, the Council will develop an online information hub to connect citizens with available information about all aspects of living in Wellington. In the first instance this will involve developing an intelligence system to support post-earthquake building inspections - this will draw on emerging sensor technology to better inform decision making.\nThe hub will also include information around hazards such as sea level rise, liquefaction, tsunami, ground shaking, as well as opportunities like volunteering, social support, funding and shared community resources. This will be a virtual collaboration space building on and connecting existing services like #wellynextdoor, Neighbourly and the Community Resilience Map. It will be based on open source data and informed by real-time sensors around the city.\nThe hub will be robust and designed to be accessible during a major shock event.\nResilience co-benefits\nThe project enables responders, citizens, researchers, investors and visitors to better participate in decision making. While the project will enable people to better understand the types of natural disasters they might encounter (Project 18), it will also provide for more engaged and connected communities (Project 4). People will be able to make their own decisions in light of the available data.\nDevelop a virtual reality model of the central city built environment\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tNEC\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will develop a model of Wellington\u2019s central city that uses 3D, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) techniques to better communicate information about Wellington and its hazards.\nAction\nTechnology plays an increasingly important role in how Wellingtonians communicate and engage with information. We have an opportunity to draw on our gaming and tech sectors to improve awareness of Wellington\u2019s hazards by developing a 3D\/VR model of the central city and simulations of how it could be affected by events such as earthquakes and sea level rise. This could be used by emergency management agencies and first responders, as well as the general public.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project will increase awareness and preparedness among groups in Wellington that may otherwise be unprepared (Project 18), as well as continuing to build capacity within our technology and academic sectors (Project 10). It will also be a mechanism for further public conversations and engagement across levels of government.\nProgramme 2.3\nAdaptation\nWe will raise awareness about the potential effects of climate change and sea level rise, and develop an adaptation plan that emphasises the need for\nfuture decisions to be made.\nClimate change presents some extremely difficult decisions around the future of existing infrastructure. As we operate, maintain and rebuild our assets,\nwe have an opportunity to build resilience qualities, including preparedness for climate change and earthquakes, into much of the infrastructure that will service\nWellingtonians for decades to come. Achieving this requires climate adaptation to be embedded into the decision making of our governments, utilities and businesses.\nHowever, this won\u2019t be easy. In a city where most people live within three kilometres of the coastline, we face some challenging discussions about future land use.\nOne of the most difficult aspects of rising sea levels is the impact on people\u2019s homes, which for many are\nnot just their homes but also their...\nfinancial security now and for their grandchildren. While coastal property owners are increasingly seeking to protect their property, some measures\nmay conflict with the wider public and environmental values of preserving natural coastal character, amenity, and public access. There is also a wider community conflict of who pays, and who gets to make decisions.\nIn Wellington we have an opportunity with National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) to develop a participatory approach to discussions with coastal communities about coastal adapation issues, including supporting tools and information.\nOur Maori communities have been here the longest; they have recovered from more shocks and stresses than most, and have evolved a network and knowledge that is pivotal for Wellington\u2019s resilience. The concept of kaitiakitanga4, guardianship of the natural environment, will remain' prominent'.....................\nLead\nDevelop a communications and engagement strategy for the Adaptation Plan\nKey partners\nWCC\tHutt City Council\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will raise awareness among coastal communities about the potential effects of sea level rise to better emphasise the need for decisions to be made in this area and prepare ground for the future Adaptation Plan.\nAction\nThis project is a preliminary step to prepare communities for the likelihood that decisions will need to be taken in the future to adapt to the effect of changing sea levels and behaviours.\nWe will talk with coastal communities to decide how we will plan for sea level rise. Engagement could be through a series of formally constituted community representative groups\/panels, including elected officials, iwi, schools and other educational facilities to co-design approaches for dealing with sea level rise.\nThe project will look for ways to preserve our natural coastal environment and its ecosystem services.\nThe project will prepare us for difficult decisions concerning\nResilience co-benefits\nThe project will start conversations with communities about climate change and especially sea level rise to make the process of developing our Adaptation Plan more inclusive and reflective (using good experiences from our other community resilience work - Project 4).\nThe project will maximise the use of natural infrastructure to protect the coast from storm damage and preserve our beaches and dunes, which are essential to Wellington\u2019s quality of life (Project 24).\nLead\nEncorage climate adaptation actions\nKey partners\nWCC\tResearch and education, arts and sports sectors\nExisting Wellington City project\nWe will encourage action on climate adaptation by providing funding for innovative projects and increasing awareness of the issues.\nAction\nWe will work with the education, arts and sports sectors to develop new, creative and engaging ways of communicating about climate change and take every opportunity to communicate about sea level rise.\nWe will also modify the Low Carbon Challenge to include climate change adaptation initiatives that promote environmental restoration and community cohesion. Finally, we will introduce a Wellington climate change adaptation fund to help cover the future costs of infrastructure redevelopment and other works required to deal with the effects of sea level rise.\nWe will work with climate entrepreneurs in other 100RC cities such as New Orleans, New York and Rotterdam to forge new links and inspire new ideas.\nResilience co-benefits\nBy using co-design principles and allocating funding to grassroots initiatives we will generate an opportunity to build stronger and more engaged communities (Project 4) by empowering people to make informed decisions about their future.\nProgramme 2.4\nRecovery\nWe will develop a framework for successful recovery from any disruption.\nWhile the Wellington region includes eight Territorial Authorities (TAs) and a regional authority - each with its own jurisdiction - our cities and districts are inseparable. Many of us live in one city or district and work in another, and much of our critical infrastructure serves multiple parts of the region. Large-scale shock events - such as big earthquakes, water contamination incidents or major storms - have no regard for jurisdictional boundaries. One issue we already know to be a challenge for our recovery across\nthe Wellington region is temporary housing. We lack good information on what percentage of homes would be uninhabitable in the event of a major natural disaster, although the number is expected to be significant.\nAt present, the Wellington region has limited arrangements and plans in place to deal with regional scale coordination after a major shock event felt across the region. The Kaikoura earthquake tested those systems and we now have a better idea of what is needed. By having\ntough discussions now about postevent leadership and governance, we can strengthen partnerships and improve coordination for when disaster strikes, as well as building more cohesive communities in good times. This will need to include all TAs in our region, Central Government, lifelines, private sector organisations, and communities themselves. This increased coordination may also help find solutions to other problems, such as growing inequality and housing affordability constraints.\nInspiration from 100RC network\n- Learning from our sibling, Christchurch\nAs Christchurch has recovered from the trauma of the earthquakes, people have rightly been focussed on future promise rather than past trauma. For Wellington, that past contains some valuable pieces of information given the seismic profile of the capital, and given the Kaikoura earthquake experience. While Wellington and Christchurch do not share exactly the same geography, they have similar governance and decisionmaking environments, infrastructure networks and cultures.\nThe 100RC network has given Wellington extra impetus and resource to allow the lessons from Christchurch and Kaikoura, good and bad, to be considered and, where appropriate, included in Wellington\u2019s planning and business.\nWe are working closely with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery entities, analysing information around governance, collaboration with Central Government, effects of liquefaction and vulnerability of centralised infrastructure. Some of the examples especially relevant for Wellington include the following.\n\u2022\tRecovery planning: Clear recovery expectations, roles and responsibilities are often discussed but rarely actioned. There is no reason not to plan for post-shock Wellington and to be open about who will be expected to do what.\n\u2022\tFocus on small business: Generally, corporates can take care of themselves. But SMEs are a large part of Wellington\u2019s economy. There are some simple things SMEs could have done in Christchurch to reduce the trauma. Wellington SMEs have the opportunity to do these things pre-event.\n\u2022\tYour home is your castle: Without a safe haven, people are emotionally vulnerable. There are simple things we can do in our homes so they can be the social, emotional and economic mainstay of our personal and collective resilience.\nLead\nKey partners\nUndertake recovery planning for the Wellington regron\nWREMO\tWellington, Hutt and Porirua councils,\nWellington Chamber of Commerce, Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency\nNew regional project\nWe will develop a Pre-disaster Recovery Framework and facilitated process to guide post-event decision making.\nAction\nWREMO will develop a recovery framework addressing all types of shocks and stresses to \u201cprepare the region to partner\u201d by addressing the varied interests of local councils, the region as a whole, the private and community sectors as well as central government. The framework will be developed to inform resilience investments across the built, social, economic, natural and cultural environments. We will facilitate a planning process with key stakeholders in the private, community and government sectors to develop a shared recovery vision and provide greater clarity of governance arrangements, roles and responsibilities, decision-making frameworks and clear linkages to resilience related investments. Ultimately, it will aim to create the right conditions for a positive recovery by preparing the region\u2019s many diverse stakeholders to partner effectively through a shared recovery framework.\nThe framework will embody the lessons learned from the Kaikoura and Canterbury earthquakes. We will explore the balance of life safety and earthquake damage. The project will link closely to other resilience projects such as Wellington Lifelines (Project 12) and Info Hub (Project 14).\nWhile preparing the city for recovery from a major disaste this planning process will als help strengthen relationships between key stakeholders.\nResilience co-benefits\nThe planning process will help to communicate the risks of living in Wellington and get formal commitment from key players that would be needed to work towards a shared recovery vision in a post-event environment. While preparing the city for recovery from a major disaster, this planning process will also help strengthen relationships between key stakeholders. It will allow us to continue mitigating risks and improve Wellington\u2019s resilience to ongoing stresses.\nLead\nCarry out postearthquake housing study\nKey partners\nWREMO\tWellington, Hutt and Porirua councils\nNew regional project\nWe will undertake a study to understand the constraints and opportunities for providing shelter and housing through the response and recovery phases after a significant seismic event or other shock affecting property.\nAction\nWREMO will undertake a temporary housing study to understand options for emergency response and recovery planning. It will address emergency and transitional shelter options, temporary housing options, live-in-place and repair options, alternative uses for existing open spaces, as well as potential finance assistance models for housing recovery. This project will examine options for various earthquake and flooding scenarios where temporary accommodation might be required, and will outline any gaps in capacity, with recommendations for how this might be addressed.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project will provide decision-makers with a clearer understanding of the capacity and capability for temporary accommodation, enabling this to be built into response and recovery planning (Project 18). While this is primarily focussed on earthquakes, as these are most likely to require large-scale temporary housing, the outcomes of this project could apply to other shocks as well. A co-benefit of this study will be identifying possible sources of temporary accommodation that could assist with the ongoing challenge of homelessness (Project 2) or temporary housing for climate refugees (Project 16).\nProgramme 3.1\nHomes and telecommunication\nWe will support initiatives that contribute to Wellington homes forming the cornerstone of the city's resilience.\nSafe, warm housing is a basic human need, but meeting this need can be expensive in Wellington. Nationally, New Zealanders spend around 23 percent of their gross disposable income on housing (seventh among OECD countries - OECD, 2015), while in Wellington City housing is considered severely unaffordable due to median prices approaching six times the median household income.\nIt is estimated the city will need an additional 21,400 houses by 2043 to meet demand (WCC, 2015b).\nDespite the high prices, the standard of housing for many Wellingtonians is inadequate. Wellington\u2019s hilly terrain means some areas do not receive much\nsun, and housing can be cold, damp and prone to mould and borer. It is well documented that poor quality housing drives significant health and energy costs across the country, although the scale of the problem is not well understood in Wellington.\nThe greatest concerns about housing quality are most often about rental properties, which are the homes of our most vulnerable citizens including immigrants, students and young families. In many cases these homes are also the least resilient to earthquakes.\nImproving the quality of these homes will not be cheap, and limited insurance literacy means that restoring homes following\na major shock event may prove difficult for many. This stems from recent changes to house insurance, where only a fixed sum is insured, rather than the total replacement cost. The result is that many Wellingtonians may not have sufficient cover to resume the same standard of living following a shock like a major earthquake. In addition, research by Massey University (2013) found that only 21 percent of New Zealanders had income protection or disability insurance, meaning most would have limited income if a major shock disrupted their place of employment.\nOur homes should be spaces to feel safe and recover following a major seismic event, but at the moment many cannot serve this function. The central city could be compromised\nand people might need to work from home at a large scale. At this point, we are not sure if our homes and telecommunications networks can support this.\nThe Mayoral Taskforce on Housing acknowledges our future challenges -as does the Future Central City project. These initiatives complement the Resilience Strategy and will be linked through the Resilience Steering Group.\nLead\nKey partners\nHelp make homes warm, safe and dry\nWREMO\tBRANZ, Earthquake Commission,\ninsurance sector\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will investigate options to improve the resilience of Wellington\u2019s new and existing housing stock so that homes can better withstand earthquakes and storms, and can be used post-event as workplaces.\nAction\nThe Council will lead two work streams: new homes and existing homes.\nWe will investigate regulatory and non-regulatory options for improving the resilience of new homes. This will include the potential requirement for new homes to be constructed with emergency water tanks, collection of grey water, solar panels and for multi-unit buildings to have \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201cbumping\u201d spaces where people can meet and work together.\nWe will also investigate regulatory and non-regulatory options and tools for existing homes. This will include the potential requirement for subfloor, foundation and roof bracing within structures to be secure, dry and adequately ventilated. In addition we will promote chimneys to be seismically secure and undertake analysis of the extent and risk of borer infestations. Existing homeowners will also be informed of other co-benefits linked to a variety of seismic strengthening options available, which will increase the resilience of their home. We will investigate opportunities to link earthquake strengthening to interventions improving the health of home environments through ventilation, insulation and double glazing.\nBoth work streams will work closely with the Mayoral Housing Taskforce. We will widely communicate the lessons learned from Christchurch. We will develop a housing warrant of fitness for owners to ensure they understand the level of maintenance needed to keep homes warm, resilient and dry. We will work with banks and insurers to explore incentives for home owners. This project will enable the Council to better evaluate the risk to the city of doing nothing. More widely, it will also improve guidance for working on older homes and develop training models on home renovations through the Building and Construction Industry Training Organisation.\nThis project is closely connected to the telecommunication sector assessment to enable large-scale working from home (Project 23) and improving access to household resilience items (Project 1).\n84 Wellington Resilience Strategy\nResilience co-benefits\nThe project will give home owners, tenants, insurers and planners confidence that housing stock can withstand a moderate level earthquake so that people can remain in their homes, and possibly work from home in the event that commercial buildings are compromised (Projects 18,19, 23).\nImproving the quality of our homes - making them warmer, safer and healthier - can also generate benefits in terms of productivity and education, becoming spaces where people can build their personal resilience to any shocks or stresses (Projects 1, 2). The project will also strengthen communities by providing an opportunity to design resilience into shared spaces (Project 5).\nInspiration from 100RC network\n- Warm, safe and dry homes in New Orleans\nWe know that Wellington\u2019s homes leave a lot to be desired. We can deal with new homes through regulations, but most of our homes are already built, and are very difficult and expensive to retrofit to make warm, dry and safe to natural hazards. Typically, the people who are most vulnerable in their homes are those who can least afford to do anything about it.\nThrough its Resilience Strategy, New Orleans has developed ways to encourage and support home owners in vulnerable areas to modify their homes to the effects of flooding. In particular, we noted the financial incentives and levers New Orleans has successfully implemented to change home owners\u2019 behaviours, and we are keen to explore similar options to achieve warmer, drier and safer homes in Wellington.\nLead\nKey partners\nSupport insurance literacy campaign\nWCC\tInsurance Council of New Zealand,\nEarthquake Commission (EQC), banks\nNew regional project\nWe will support home, business and asset owners to make informed decisions about their insurance cover.\nAction\nThe Insurance Council of New Zealand (ICNZ) will conduct a survey to test the level of knowledge about insurance and better understand the social consequences of underinsurance. We will also assess people\u2019s ability to access insurance. Depending on survey results, ICNZ will undertake a targeted campaign to make home and asset owners aware of the gap between assumption and reality, with advice on where to hnd out more information, and what to consider when calculating the right level of insurance cover.\nResilience co-benefits\nReflecting on Canterbury, better information about insurance will allow systems to be integrated with response, recovery and risk reduction planning. It will open doors to debate on other tools to build resilience into Wellington\u2019s homes. EQC will be able to better communicate its role and responsibilities.\nIt is also an opportunity to engage with communities, and to connect them to key information and knowledge so they can make better decisions. Home owners will have a more realistic understanding of their liability\nand responsibility, and will make sure they have the right\nlevel of insurance. This work will support the objectives\nrelating to home resilience (Project 20) and business\nresilience (Project 9).\nUnderstand the scale of the non-weathertight homes problem\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tMinistry of Business Innovation and\nEmployment\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will undertake a study of Wellington homes to assess the risk of water ingress in our new and existing housing leading to health issues resulting from cold, dampness and mould.\nAction\nThe Council will undertake a targeted analysis to determine the scale of weathertightness issues in Wellington\u2019s housing stock. The project report will provide recommendations or actions required for home improvements, and be accompanied by guidance developed for home owners; promoting regular maintenance, adequate insulation and ventilation and outlining options for cost-effective repairs.\nThe project will provide information to support discussions with central government and the building sector to address this issue. It will also support a balanced public debate and provide an opportunity to talk with communities and offer them key information to make better decisions.\nResilience co-benefits\nThe project will improve the Council\u2019s understanding of the scale of the problem. This will enable decisions to be made around what, if any, action is required to ensure these homes can withstand future shocks from seismic and extreme weather events. Warmer and drier homes lead to better health and comfort for the occupants, improving their chances in regards to social, educational and economic outcomes. The outcomes of this project will inform our work on resilient homes (Project 20).\nAssess the capacity for large-scale remote working\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tVodafone, Spark, Porirua and Hutt councils\nNew regional project\nWe will assess the telecommunications sector\u2019s capability to support high numbers of people working from home after a seismic event or other significant shock. This initiative is undertaken in conjunction with Project 5 - supporting community spaces for wellbeing and post-disaster roles.\nAction\nWCC and other councils will work with the asset owners to assess the\ntelecommunications sector\u2019s ability to support remote working for a large number of Wellingtonians over a prolonged period, based on a common understanding of levels of service. The assessment will make recommendations on any gaps identified.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project will help us understand the gaps we need to fill to ensure a large percentage of Wellington\u2019s workforce and economy can continue operating after a major shock. At the same time, this work could also see a reduced need for travel and encourage more flexibility in ways of working, even when not faced with a disruptive event. This could benefit employers and employees, potentially reducing an existing barrier to workforce participation; for example, by enabling more part-time work by those caring for children or returning from maternity leave, as well as older people or those with mobility constraints. This project is related to promotion of new economic hubs (Project 8) and development of community spaces for post-disaster roles (Project 5) and has relevance to work with ageing population (Project 3).\n1-connected homes provide more ibility during disruptions and are e inclusive for people who can't on't want to travel to work.\nProgramme 3.2\nWater and natural environment\nWe will ensure that Wellingtonians always have access to water services, in a way that enhances our natural environment.\nt is estimated that in the event of a significant earthquake, water supply in Wellington will not be restored for up to 70 days in some locations. Most Wellingtonians only store water for 3 days. Rainwater collection could significantly improve levels of self-sufficiency, but very few houses are equipped for this. This also represents a missed opportunity to future-proof our water supply from threats that may seem remote today, but could arise in an uncertain future, such as droughts.\nPopulation growth will put further pressure on our wastewater infrastructure, which is already at capacity, posing a risk for human health and the environment. Wellingtonians are not prepared to manage their wastewater without reticulated wastewater infrastructure. Any disaster is likely to be compounded by health risks related to contamination of public spaces with untreated sewage.\nClimate change is expected to bring more intense rainfall, which will put additional stress on our highly modified (by culverts, for example) urban water systems. Urban intensification in response to population growth in our city is also generating demand for available land, placing increased pressure on our natural assets, while increasing demand for fresh water and generating more wastewater and runoff.\nw\n\"e depend on a healthy natural environment to provide a range of benefits known collectively as \u201cecosystem services\u201d, which include water and air purification, recreation and wellbeing, and pollination. The biodiversity that contributes to these services exists in our reserves, parks, urban gardens, waterways, wetlands and coast. While some of this may be under increasing pressure, Wellington is fortunate to have abundant natural assets.\nA key element in the City Resilience Framework used across the 100RC network is protecting and enhancing these natural assets. This is especially relevant for adapting to rising sea levels and increased storm surges - \u201csoft\u201d measures, such as dune nourishment and protecting natural kelp beds, can be highly effective for dissipating wave energy and reducing the extent and severity of erosion and inundation. From an urban resilience perspective, the\ngreat advantage of these approaches is the opportunity for co-benefits - natural defences can provide recreational values, generate habitat for indigenous biodiversity, and make an area more attractive. They may also be combined with harder defences to provide flexible community spaces and active transport corridors along a raised shoreline.\nLead\nImprove water systems through ecological interventions\nKey partners\nWCC\tThe Nature Conservancy, Wellington Water\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will integrate ecological interventions into how we manage Wellington\u2019s water system to improve the quality of stormwater entering our streams and coast, improve resilience to flash floods and enhance urban biodiversity.\nAction\nThe Council\u2019s urban ecology team will reduce the barriers to the uptake of water sensitive urban design (WSUD) by delivering a series of studies and demonstration projects in partnership with infrastructure managers and environmental groups. Specifically, we will assess the costs and benefits of ecologically enhanced stormwater systems, investigate alternative financing instruments and map existing expertise. We will also develop a large-scale demonstration project in a number of hydrologically linked locations in urban settings and bigger open public spaces. The project will also include a series of training seminars delivered by international experts from The Nature Conservancy and other 100RC cities.\nWe have an opportunity to improve the quality of our urban spaces, enhancing biodiversity and our wellbeing, while at the same time improving our city's ability to cope with heavy rainfall or earthquakes.\nResilience co-benefits\nThe project will improve understanding of the feasibility and value case for applying ecological interventions in fresh water management, including stream daylighting, developing wetlands, and other WSUD such as rain gardens, ponds and tanks, permeable pavements, and green walls and roofs. It will provide an opportunity for traditional water engineers and landscape designers to collectively develop effective, place-based approaches by learning from each other and international experts.\nEffective WSUD slows down rainwater flow and improves its quality by capturing contaminants. As a result, it minimises damage associated with slips and erosion and reduces need for water treatment. This type of measure is likely to form part of our climate Adaptation Plan (Project 16). In addition, better capture of rainwater provides an efficient alternative to expensive infrastructure development and reduces impact on water sources in our regional parks. WSUD will also improve the quality of urban spaces for our communities (Project 5), enhancing our biodiversity and our wellbeing, as well as being increasing our robustness and resilience in a seismic event (Project 18).\nWorking with Platform Partners\n- Conserving nature with The Nature Conservancy\nWellingtonians love nature. As a port city, we especially acknowledge Tangaroa and te mana o te wai5. As the city grows and changes, we will need to work hard to retain and maybe enhance what we have for future generations.\nThe Nature Conservancy, one of the 100RC Platform Partners, will be an important partner in helping us improve water systems through ecological interventions.\nThe Nature Conservancy has a wealth of experience in this area, and we have looked to the work undertaken with the city of Melbourne in biodiversity to understand the strength of this opportunity. We are looking to make better use of Wellington\u2019s natural resources through initiatives such as transforming some stormwater pipes into open streams, enhancing the city\u2019s biodiversity and amenity while managing hydraulic flows.\nUrban SOS\nVictoria University students\u2019 future vision for a water sensitive Wellington has been shortlisted from 200 participants in a global competition, Urban SOS: Fair Share, which is run jointly by 100RC, AECOM and Van Alen Institute.\nLead\nKey partners\nWCC\tVeolia, Wellington Water\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will reduce carbon and landfill liability related to sewage management.\nAction\nThe Council will undertake an options assessment for sewage sludge disposal to identify preferred options.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project directly addresses the stress on infrastructure, and puts in place a suite of investment options that mitigate future capacity issues. At the same time, the city\u2019s financial exposure to carbon markets will be reduced.\nAdditionally, a better sludge disposal operation can be linked to energy production, making Wellington less dependent on external energy supply.\nFinally, the status quo is not consistent with how Wellington perceives itself environmentally. A better disposal option will bring Wellington\u2019s aspirations into alignment with what actually happens on the ground.\nWorking with Platform Partners\n- Talking rubbish with Veolia\nWellington aspires to be an eco-city that is a leader in environmental practice. One of the biggest differences the city can make is to improve the way we dispose of organic waste - currently this makes up the largest proportion of the Council\u2019s carbon emissions inventory.\nFacilitated by 100RC, Veolia and Wellington Water have come together to examine the opportunity to change the current practice, and are developing proposals to convert organic waste, and sewage sludge in particular, into energy. This would not only solve several complex waste management issues, but also build redundancy into Wellington\u2019s vulnerable energy supply chain.\nVeolia is one of the 100RC platform partners. It works with hundreds of diverse cities around the world on water, energy, and waste management.\nLead\nEnsure emergency water supply for Wellrngton Hosprtal\nKey partners\nWCC\tCapital and Coast District Health Board\nExisting Wellington City project\nWe will ensure robust emergency water supply for Wellington Hospital in Newtown.\nAction\nThe Council will work with Wellington Water, the District Health Board and relevant Central Government agencies to agree on delivery methods and funding for the emergency water supply for Wellington Hospital and implement the project. The project will investigate synergies related to restoration of existing watercourses and irrigation of urban agriculture projects in the neighbourhood.\nResilience co-benefits\nThis project improves the likelihood that Wellington Hospital will be able to function after an earthquake and may also identify water efficiency opportunities for the day-to-day operation of the hospital.\nThe project presents an opportunity to create a new amenity in Newtown, perhaps connecting with some of the local streams (Project 24) and providing irrigation for the local urban farm (Projects 5 and 6).\nInvest in water and wastewater resilience and awareness\nLead\tKey partners\nWellington Water\tWCC, WREMO\nScaling up of existing regional project\nWe will accelerate investment in water resilience and promote emergency water and sewage preparedness options to citizens, businesses and institutions to encourage them to take action and be self-sufficient for at least 7 days following a disaster.\nAction\nWellington Water will design and implement an accelerated investment programme supported by an initiative that reinforces the need for all individuals, communities and institutions to take responsibility for their own emergency water and sewage. This includes further promotion of household emergency water tanks and increased use of grey and rain water. The communication will also aim to grow awareness of the sewage disposal challenge if reticulation is unavailable.\nResilience co-benefits\nThe project will improve Wellington\u2019s ability to cope with a shock, and the ability of Wellingtonians to withstand a water and a sewage network outage for longer periods of time. This will be beneficial in the immediate response during a disaster and recovery minimising health risks and contamination of the environment (Project 18).\nAt the same time, promotion of grey water use and rainwater retention measures will reduce demand for water from the mains network, reducing pressure on water supply, as well as reducing costs of water treatment and pumping. This will also have a beneficial effect for stormwater management (Project 24), slowing down the runoff during the flash floods expected as a consequence of climate change (Project 16).\nProgramme 3.3\nTransport and energy\nWe will work with infrastructure owners to ensure flexibility and robustness of transport and energy services in Wellington.\nThe current and future\nprosperity of Wellington relies on mobility of people, goods and information. Despite higher levels of cycling and walking than most other parts of New Zealand, Wellington remains highly reliant on road transportation. Seventy-one percent of trips were made by car in the Wellington region between 2010 and 2014, and 70 percent of freight was moved by road in 2012.\nThe way our region\u2019s transport corridor is shaped means it can be easily disrupted. Around 27% of workers in Wellington use it each day, and if it is closed, even briefly as it was after the Kaikoura earthquake, traffic comes to a standstill. Projects like the Transmission Gully motorway are important for the robustness of our region\u2019s transport networks, but we also need to look at other approaches for generating\nflexibility and relieving congestion. While Wellington Harbour is also important for inter-island transport between Aotea Quay and Picton, it is also the main backup point of entry should land access be compromised.\nThe Kaikoura earthquake has highlighted the fact this is a significant vulnerability for Wellington.\nWellington\u2019s public transport continues to improve, but it is likely that private vehicle travel will remain important in Wellington. There is a trend towards types of vehicle that are less reliant on our vulnerable fuel supply chains and also produce fewer emissions. As 82 percent (MBIE, 2016) of Wellington\u2019s electricity comes from renewable sources - chiefly from a windfarm located within the boundary of Wellington City - we are especially well positioned for use of electric vehicles.\nWellington\u2019s strong use of renewables is a great asset for our ability to cope with oil price shocks and breakdown in supply chains, but we know that our electricity distribution network is vulnerable to high winds, earthquake, fires and other natural and manmade hazards. Most citizens are unaware of the high degree of vulnerability, or of how reliant our economy is on its power supply. While we are currently looking to build robustness into the physical network, Wellingtonians are also increasingly discussing the idea of distributed infrastructure such us mini hydro, solar and wind generators. Distributed generation infrastructure builds our ability to cope with fuel and power supply disruptions following major shocks, and in the future may be able to help relieve the pressures on households from rising energy costs.\n98 Wellington Resilience Strategy\nSupport flexible energy supply\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tWellington Electricity, Transpower\nNew regional project\nWe will work with Wellington\u2019s electricity sector to build in redundancy and flexibility into our energy supply.\nAction\nThe Council will work with Wellington Electricity and the Commerce Commission to make the network less vulnerable and perform to the agreed service levels.\nThis will include investigation into incorporating network resilience in price setting mechanisms. We will also investigate options for incentivising uptake of technology that will build household energy independence, which could include microgeneration, battery packs, solar roofs, small-scale wind, tidal energy and neighbourhood microgrids.\nResilience co-benefits\nThe project seeks an energy network that is robust and flexible. A more decentralised network that includes multiple small-scale generation sources will perform better in an earthquake or a storm (Project 18), and will have an added benefit of reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\nThis approach can also generate economic opportunity, positioning Wellington as a leader in alternative technologies and building on our existing reputation as a low-carbon city (Projects 8,10).\nSupport widespread adoption of electric vehicles\nLead\tKey partners\nWCC\tWellington Electricity\nNew Wellington City project\nWe will enable widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs) in Wellington, reducing dependence on the vulnerable fuel supply chain, as well as our carbon footprint.\nAction\nThis project will see the Council lead by example by switching its fleet to EVs as they become due for replacement. We will give priority to contractors that use EVs, including waste, recycling and street cleaning contractors.\nWe will support use outside of the Council by investing in charging\ninfrastructure across the city, as well as working with other regional councils to establish a broader charging network. Uptake of EVs will also be supported through the District Plan, particularly in regards to charging infrastructure for apartments and new homes.\nResilience co-benefits\nA significant increase in electric vehicles will drive reductions in air pollution and noise, resulting in health benefits for all Wellingtonians. In the event of a major shock that disrupts fuel supply chains, EVs may provide ongoing mobility, particularly if they are able to be recharged through renewable and distributed sources of energy (Project 28). EV batteries may also be able to provide emergency household power sources in the event of a seismic emergency.\nThe project will also generate alternative income\/business development opportunities in the clean technology industry (Project 8 and 10).\nInspiration from 100RC network\n- Mexico's integrated mobility system\nMexico\u2019s vision is to have an integrated mobility system that prioritises public transportation over private vehicles and provides a safe urban environment for pedestrians and cyclists.\nRather than accept traffic congestion, the city has decided to act decisively to promote an integrated mobility system to revitalise Mexico; discourage the use of private vehicles; create a safe and accessible city for pedestrians and cyclists; prepare the mobility system for the potential risks and effects of climate change, and promote the use of data to improve decision making on mobility.\nMexico City focusses on mobility, not cars, which resonates with many\nWellingtonians, as does the explicit connection to climate change and revitalisation. Improved mobility also has a very real benefit in reducing air pollution and traffic congestion, with health and social co-benefits.\nLead\nKey partners\nLeverage transportation investment to improve Wellington's resilience\nNew Zealand Transport\tWCC\nAgency (NZTA)\nExisting Wellington City project\nWe will work with NZTA to build and maintain resilient transport infrastructure for critical routes and all transport modes.\nAction\nThis project is effectively an advisory project, where the Council will be an active partner and resilience champion for the following projects:\n\u2022\tCoastal cycleways: improving cycle network and coastal defence\n\u2022\tPetone to Ngauranga link: addressing vulnerability of link between Hutt and central Wellington\n\u2022\tLet\u2019s Get Wellington Moving: reducing congestion in the central city\n\u2022\tFuture of the Port: reducing vulnerability of the port\nThis will involve the Council strongly advocating for application of resilience principles in these projects. This could include greater inclusiveness through more meaningful engagement on end-user needs during project design and delivery, resourcefulness by encouraging infrastructure that serves multiple purposes, or robustness by ensuring that worst-case climate change projections are considered during project design phases.\nResilience co-benefits\nAs a group, these projects will improve access into the city for people and goods, as well as encouraging active lifestyles. All road users will benefit. It will provide redundancy in transport while improving everyday options. Advocating strongly for active use of resilience principles will ensure that co-benefits are maximised. Key projects that will connect with this initiative are encouraging adoption of electric vehicles (Project 29), undertaking recovery planning (Project 18) and developing a climate adaptation plan (Project 16).\nA resilient transport network has inbuilt redundancy and flexibility to cope with disaster. It can also encourage an active lifestyle.\nImplementing Wellington Resilience Strategy\nProducing a strategy it not the end of thinkin about resilience -\nit\u2019s the beginnin\nWe are currently working on an Implementation Plan that will assign responsibilities, time frames and resources to ensure the projects are delivered and their resilience value realised. Collectively, the projects will begin the process of integrating resilience thinking into all decisions affecting the future of our city, including long-term planning. Many Wellingtonians have already put up their hand to join the project teams.\nWe hope many more will join in as we start delivering our resilience projects.\nA number of leaders have been identified and organised into a Resilience Steering Group that will empower key sectors to integrate and adapt resilience thinking into their work.\nSteering Group members have been drawn from Central Government; the social and housing sectors; Wellington, Hutt City and Porirua City councils; Civil Defence; the insurance and commercial sectors; and academia.\nAs well as monitoring progress, the group will undertake a 3-year review early in\n2020 to provide recommendations to further improve the strategy. This could include amending the project list in consideration of lessons learned, refining our goals and programmes, and reviewing our resilience challenges to ensure they remain relevant.\nThe Steering Group will formally report to Wellington, Porirua and Hutt City councils annually in February.\n104 Wellington Resilience Strategy\n100 Resilient

efforts of both its people and institutions. These efforts helped Ramallah become selected as a proud member of the global 100 Resilient Cities network. Ramallah is well situated to lead the resilience efforts in our evolving state, as part of our work to achieve our full independence and self-determination. Membership of the network signifies a shift in establishing a vital multidisciplinary tactic to proactively cope, adapt and transform againstthe shocksand stresses Palestinian cities may encounter.\nThrough its history, culture and architecture, every aspect of Ramallah is evidence of its resilience. Ramallah city is persistently overcoming obstacles, whilst transitioning with innovation and creativity. Nowadays, the challenges facing our urban condition are different and freguently altering. Therefore, in times of limited resources, building urban resilience to eguip the city from the social, environmental and economic aspect is needed like no other time before. Ramallah now reguires excellence in social and institutional\ntransformation by employing resilience thinking in all of its operations. Involvement in this project will unite efforts, and foster energies through the new resilience global network.\nWe commend Ramallah Municipality- represented by its Mayor Mousa Hadid and its Municipal Council, staff, 100RC and the resilience team, all partners, and Ramallah citizens - for actively participating in the development of Resilient Ramallah 2050. The Office of the President and the Government of Palestine will provide all possible support needed to facilitate the strategy implementation, in preparation for its expansion in other Palestinian cities, and on the top is \"The Jewel of the Crown\", our capital, Jerusalem. In this regard, we ask all local and international partners to provide support to translate this strategy into actions on the ground to benefit our people. This is a step further in the process of building our necessary state institutions, and in supportto end occupation and achieve independence and freedom for our people.\nThis is a great opportunity for Ramallah and Palestine to integrate resilience thinking into our development paradigm, especially in our efforts to achieve a sustainable and viable Palestinian economy and overall development.\nThe release of Resilient Ramallah 2050 will help our efforts to reduce our dependency on others and contribute to a more holistic and integrated development in Palestine. We will make all efforts to capitalize on Ramallah's excellent work to date and we will provide all possible support needed to achieve the resilience vision of Ramallah as a leading example in local government development.\nWe congratulate Ramallah municipality represented by its Mayor Mousa Hadid and its municipal councils, city director and staff, the Resilience team represented by Dr Shaheen, 100 Resilient Cities and their partners for this excellent achievement. We look forward to putting this strategy into actions that can have positive impact on Palestinian people in Ramallah and Palestine.\nBefore the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, the local government sector faced several economic, social and physical shocks related to Israeli occupation. Dealing with these urgent challenges diverted resources away from achieving our long-term vision to delivers modern local government sector that provides guality services and is adaptable to current and future challenges. Despite these shocks, we have continued towards our vision with a strength and commitment of which we should be very proud.\nIn this context, it is an honour to be part of a creative and successful initiative: the Resilient Ramallah 2050. This strategy reflects our success in planning and developing a new non-traditional approach in local government. This strategy will help us enter to a new phase of investing in the future to deal with natural or human-made shocks and stresses, and to secure wellbeing and safety of our people in all circumstances. Additionally, the actions in the Resilient Ramallah 2050 strategy serve as an important milestone in the advancement of science and technology in Palestine and our guest to keep pace with leading developed nations.\nResilient Ramallah 2050 is truly forward-thinking, seeking to positively influence the resilience of Ramallah and its\nsurroundings, and in doing so will provide an inspiring model for other cities in Palestine. The strategy will allow us to deal more effectively with a range of challenges associated with rapidly growing cities, as well as build resilience to external pressures that undermine Palestine's stability and can drive internal migration, crowdedness, and socioeconomic ineguality. These challenges have been addressed creatively in this strategy.\nFinally, I would like to thank all teams who participated in completing this strategy, including the Ministry of Local Government, Ramallah Municipality, and the project's Steering Committee members. Special thanks mustalso go to 100 Resilient Cities, which has provided significant supportand facilitated access to a range of international experts who helped in the technical development of this strategy.\nMayor of Ramallah\nWelcome to our dynamic, vibrant and optimistic city of\nRamallah!\nIt has been a tremendous privilege for our city to join the 100\nResilient Cities network. It has allowed city leaders to come\ntogether with a wide range of citizens representing many\ndifferent sectors and walks of life, applying new thinking to\nthe challenges facing our city. Together, we have considered\nthe guestion: whatactions mustwe take to ensure our city is\ntruly resilient by 2050 and beyond?\nDespite the complex political challenges facing our city,\nRamallah has always stayed optimistic. Our city can\nprovide an illuminating example for other cities - not only\nhave we survived complex challenges presented by Israeli\noccupation - but we have witnessed rapid growth that is\nimproving guality of life for many of our people, in difficult\nconditions. Despite these successes, we continue to strive\nfora better future.\nApplying a resilience lens - where we consider the\ninteractions between the acute shocks and chronic stresses that Ramallah may face - has helped us to identify new, collaborative ways of working that can help improve the lives of all Rama Hites. Our work to date has also emphasized the important role Ramallah Municipality has in leading the charge of building resilience within the city, our region, and potentially even at the national level. This has evolved gradually not only through producing this strategy document, but also in integrating the work across the different departments and sectors in the city.\nI would like to seize the opportunity to invite you all to come and visit our vibrant and hospitable city, to enjoy its food, culture, history, and to socialize with our hospitable citizens. We welcome new partnerships based on mutual respect and interests -in Ramallah you will find open hearts, minds, and a culture of welcoming and respecting others.\nFinally, I would like to thank all local citizens, partners and experts who participated actively in the development of this strategy. In addition to the resilience team led by Dr Mohammad Shaheen, this includes the steering committee represented by his Excellency Dr Hussein Alaaraj (Minister of Local Government), the Advisory Committee, Municipal Council and staff, City Director, members of working groups, and all those who contributed to our numerous workshops and other events. With our great local and international partners, we are committed to turning this strategy into reality.\nPresident of 100 Resilient Cities\nOn behalf of 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation (100RC), I wantto congratulate Mayor Hadid and the City of Ramallah on the release of Resilient Ramallah 2050, the city's first Resilience Strategy. The Strategy is the product of much hard work and is an important milestone in Ramallah's resilience journey.\nA message of optimism runs through this strategy that reflects a key strength of Ramallah and its people. While it acknowledges the city's unigue position within the 100RC network as facing significant constraints around use of land, resources, and free movement of its people, Resilient Ramallah 2050 does not focus on what isn't possible. Instead, it is a call to remain focused on what can be done, nowand in the future, to realise the city's great potential, develop resilience to whatever shocks and stresses it may face, and build a future in which Ramallah not only survives but thrives.\nAs Ramallah and surrounding cities continue their rapid growth, this Strategy encourages new types of partnerships. Closer coordination with neighbouring Al-Bireh and Beitunia\nwill help Ramallah achieve its resilience goals, as well as that of the region. Other partnerships are also critical to the city's success, including new collaborations with the private and academic sectors and active engagement with the city's various communities to ensure their voices and concerns are reflected in the decisions affecting them. We are also excited by the relationships Ramallah will develop from our partners and cities in the 100RC network - be it learning from other cities facing similar challenges, or working with specialists from our Platform of Partners.\nResilient Ramallah 2050 presents an ambitious but practical program. It includes actions in which the municipality and other partners can achieve immediate benefits, as well as other longer-term actions that have the potential to be truly transformative.\nWe commend Ramallah Municipality on this enormous achievement. Though this strategy represents the end of the strategic planning process, it is only the beginning of the exciting workto come in the months and years ahead. And 100 Resilient Cities' partnership with the city is also just beginning.\nNow we can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively impactthe lives of all who call Ramallah home. We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these efforts.\nDr Mohammad Shaheen, Ramallah's Chief Resilience Officer\nIt gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Resilient Ramallah 2050. This is our city's first ever comprehensive resilience strategy, which lays out a vision for a sustainable and optimistic city that is resilient to any challenge it may face.\nAlthough Ramallah is a relatively small city in size and population, we have been able to grow, thrive and become a model city in Palestine and the region. Ramallah has managed to demonstrate resilience despite conflict and continuous political and environmental stresses. The importance of this Strategy is to join forces under a common vision and framework, integrating efforts to achieve benefits that may not be possible through working separately.\nAs our city grows, the challenges we face become increasingly interconnected. The growth of Ramallah as a center for employment presents not only a huge opportunity, butalso significant challenges for mobilityand service provision that extend beyond municipal borders. Additionally, our city relies almost entirely on water and energy resources controlled by Israel, leaving us vulnerable to supply disruptions.\nAddressing these and other challenges reguires us to rethink our ways of working, embracing new kinds of collaboration across sectors and levels of government. As someone who has spent his career working as a public health professional, butwithouta background in urban planning, I have learnt so much from collaborating with others and considering different perspectives on how to realize Ramallah's amazing potential. This also reguires us to listen to community members who bearthe conseguences- positive or otherwise - of many of the decisions we make about our city.\nIt is in this spirit that we have identified the 37 tangible resilience-building actions outlined in this strategy. These are distinct, yet connected actions to be delivered over different spatial scales and timeframes. This includes a mix of \u2018quick win' actions (which involve building on our strengths and scaling up current efforts to achieve immediate benefits) and longer-term actions with the potential to be truly transformative for the resilience of Ramallah and its surroundings. While Ramallah Municipality will take a leading\nrole in implementing many of the actions, all actions will reguire collaboration and some will be led by other partners.\nI cannot emphasize enough the role of Ramallah citizens in the journey to date - this Strategy benefits from the insights of numerous city professionals who are already working to make Ramallah more resilient. This includes the Ramallah Mayor Eng Mousa Hadid; City Director Ahmad Abu Laban; Ramallah Municipal Council members; the Governor of Ramallah and Al-Bireh District; Directors of the departments and staff within Ramallah Municipality; the public and private sectors; the many Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) currently implementing resilience-building projects within Ramallah and its surroundings, and the unconditional support of Dr Hussein Ala'raj, the Minister of Palestinian Local Government.\nWe have also drawn on significant support and expertise from around the world. This pioneering work would not have been possible without unconditional support from 100 Resilient Cities, as well as our Strategy Partner, AECOM.\nNow, we must unite to fully implement the Resilient Ramallah actions. We must act together to ensure a secure and 2050 strategy; integrate resilience thinking in the way we\tprosperous future for ourselves and future generations,\nwork, and create the next generation of resilience-building\nTo support our Resilient Ramallah vision we will take action in three strategic directions:\nWe will foster a culture of self-determination and build the self-sufficiency of our city and its people\nWe will renew our governance structures to increase transparency collaboration, evidence-based decision making, and meaningful community engagement\nWe will build prosperity by making the most our city\u2019s unique mix of cultural, intellectual, physical and natural assets\nUrban resilience describes the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems\nwithin a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nResilient Ramallah 2050 considers how shocks that affect us on a short time-scale can interact with the chronic stresses that weaken the fabric of our city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis. By addressing these interactions and finding ways to better meet the needs of communities in good times, we also improve ourability to respond to, and bounce backfrom, a range of disruptive events.\n100RC has assisted Ramallah in many ways:\n\u2022\tFunding the role of a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) in Ramallah Municipality to coordinate our resilience-building efforts\n\u2022\tOffering expert support through partner organisations to deliver this strategy and support engagement with Ramallah citizens\n\u2022\tConnecting Ramallah through a global network of peer cities to share ideas and solutions-this includes participating in annual summits with the CROs of all other cities in the network, as well as more targeted exchange events, such as a Migration Exchange in Athens\n\u2022\tAccess to the 100RC Platform - a group of leading service providers who so far have offered preliminary, in-kind support around issues of water and wastewater management in Ramallah.\nIncreasing value through the City Resilience Framework (CRF) and \"resilience lens\"\nResilient Ramallah 2050 has benefited from a range of valuable tools that help cities prioritize their resilience challenges and opportunities, as well as increase the resilience value of potential actions:\n\u2022\tCities throughout the 100RC network use the City Resilience Framework (CRF, below) to help them understand the complex and overlapping systems that contribute to their resilience. The CRF comprises four dimensions and 12 drivers that together illustrate what make a city resilient.\n\u2022\tThe \"resilience lens\", which we used to sharpen our thinking and inform the design of the specific resiliencebuilding actions described from page 54 in this strategy.\n\u2022 To apply the resilience lens, we asked if proposed actions:\n-\tApproach risks and vulnerabilities in a cross-sector and comprehensive way\n-\tConsider the impact of multiple shocks and stresses\n-\tAim to support eguitable outcomes\n-\tIncorporate the relevant gualities of resilient systems (shown opposite)\n-\tUse the ability and capacities of a broad group of stakeholders\n-\tConsiderthe possible conseguences (directand indirect) over different time scales\n-\tConsider regional, national and international implications.\nAll resilient systems share similar qualities\nAlternative strategies can easily be adopted to deliver critical services, depending\non the circumstances.\nPast experiences inform future decisions and actions.\nBroad and meaningful engagement, aiming for shared ownership among\nstakeholders.\nConnections between systems and institutions are harnessed to generate\nmultiple benefits.\nRecognising alternative ways to use resources.\nSpare capacity exists to allow continued functioning even when disrupted.\nSystems are well-conceived constructed and managed. Any failure is predictable,\nsafe, and proportionate.\nPerched some 880m above sea level, Ramallah means God's Hills in Arabic. It is a fitting name for the city that became the administrative center for the Government of the State of Palestine, the Palestine National Authority (PNA), in 1994.\nLocated approximately 16km north of Jerusalem in the Palestinian West Bank, Ramallah was originally established in the mid-1500s by the Haddadin family as a Christian village. It grewthroughout the 17th and 18th centuries asa predominantly agricultural village, and by the mid-1800s, missionary groups had built different schools and churches. The demographics of our city changed as more people moved to the newly incorporated city in the early 1900s, attracted by high living standards that resulted from developing trade routes with the USA.\nSince then, our prosperity, continuity and identity have been tested through separate periods of occupation and mass immigration. Today, the State of Palestine remains under Israeli occupation, meaning we lack control over Palestinian resources that are crucial for our resilience, including mobility, land, borders and water.\nDespite these conditions, Ramallah is a proud, growing and cosmopolitan city. As the seat of the Government of the State of Palestine, our city is a base for many major organisations, including NGOs and banks. It is also home to a burgeoning arts and cultural scene. We are a city that embraces diversity, free exchange of ideas, creativity, and respects the human and cultural rights of its residents and visitors.\nRamallah also has an increasingly international outlook.\nNot only are we proud to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities network, butwe also have formal connections with more than 30 cities from all over the globe, such as Toulouse in France, Johannesburg in South Africa, Trondheim in Norway and Amsterdam in Holland. Through these connections we seek to represent the voice of our city, share knowledge and help implement best practice initiatives for our citizens.\nMajor waves of immigration\n1908 - Growth after Ramallah's incorporation as a city\n1948 war - Palestinian catastrophe (Alnakba) after Israel was established\n1967 war - Military occupation of West Bank and Gaza Strip by Israel\n1993 - Oslo Accords signed between Palestinians and Israelis and subsequent migration to the city\nWe have constrained mobility and access to resources\nWhile Ramallah sits mostly within Area A (see opposite), the movement of people and resources between Ramallah, other Palestinian cities and the wider region is severely constrained by the belt of Areas 'B' and 'C' that surround our city, as well as the lack of control over borders. With requirement to pass through regular checkpoints and the risk of unexpected route closures, commuters regularly suffer long delays, and supply chains become disrupted with serious implications for business continuity.\nPresently, we are almost entirely dependent on others for energy and water. Our electricity supply company, Jerusalem District Electricity Company (JDECo), does not possess any of its own power stations - it buys over 95% of electricity from the Israel Electricity Corporation, and the rest from Jordan. Similarly, access to water resources is controlled by Israel. Although the second Oslo Accord made provision for Palestinian access to the Mountain Aquifer, Article 40 requires Israeli approval for any proposed Palestinian water management measure or infrastructure project, which limits the development of new wells.\nWaste is collected and sent to a distant landfill. This is expensive, the facility is nearing capacity and road closures can disrupt access. There is also a missed opportunity to capitalize on the potential to reuse the plastic and paper locallyand potentially generate energy from residual waste.\nWhat are the Oslo Accords? What about Areas Ar B and C?\nDesigned to provide a frameworkfor resolving the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Oslo Accords (1993-1995) provided a level of self-determination for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It led to an interim government for the State of Palestine and created three tiers of administration for land in the West Bank: Area 'A' (18% of land area) under Palestinian civil administration and security control: Area 'B' (22%) under Palestinian civil administration but shared security control with Israel, and Area 'C' (60%) under Israeli civil and security control.\nLimited space to develop\nThe grey areas in the map on the opposite page show that our urban area has grown significantly between 2006 and 2016.\nRamallah's ability to expand further is constrained by several challenges. The realities of the Oslo Accords make new development difficult outside of Area A, and the hilly topography means that development in many vacant areas is either technical not feasible or commercially unviable.\nAt present, the steepest slopes that are developed have a gradient of around 30 percent. There is only around 250ha of land remaining within Area A-where development is largely under Palestinian control - that has a gradient within this range, as shown in green. Although this has resulted in an increase in land values, it has reduced affordability of property and housing, which is a growing challenge for many residents. Areas where it is still possible to build are often disconnected from the main urban area and transport infrastructure connection reguires Israeli approval.\nAccommodating expected population growth in the coming years reguires us to be more innovative with the land we do control.\nThis means looking into new ways to build higher densities, supported by rigorous standards and guidelines that support resilience outcomes.\nOur governance is complex and unique\nThe complexities of the Oslo Accords ensure Ramallah sits at the heart of a complicated governance structure unlike any other in the world. This affects all aspects of life, with significant implications for managing resources, delivering infrastructure, and ultimately, improving the resilience of our city.\nMore locally, rapid growth means our city has now become a conurbation - a contiguous urban area that joins to the neighbouring urban areas of the cities of Al-Bireh and Beitunia. As such, there is an increasing need for the three municipalities to unite to deliver cross-boundary infrastructure; share data; attract development funding more effectively, and realize potential efficiencies from shared service delivery.\nCompared to some cities in the 100RC network, a democratic governance model remains relatively new in Ramallah. This means there is nota well-established culture of community participation in government decision-making, which is recognized in the City Resilience Framework as an important component of a resilient city. However, we have already made great strides in this area through different participatory mechanisms and we acknowledge improving two-way dialogue with communities as an ongoing priority. This needs to be supported by a clearer and consistently enforced framework of laws protecting the rights of citizens.\nOur economic development must be more proactive\nThe establishment of the PNA has created tens of thousands of newjobs in the civil service, as well as attracting numerous international and local NGOs, along with the headguarters of large corporations, countries' diplomatic representatives and banks. Despite higher-than-average salaries, the cost of living is also significantly higher than elsewhere in Palestine. With this comes greater use of bank loans to cover the cost of housing and to buy non-appreciating assets, such as cars.\nDespite major growth, our economy remains very vulnerable. The Government and civil service that drive our economy are heavily dependent on foreign aid and donor investment, which could potentially be diverted elsewhere with short notice. However, perhaps our biggest economic vulnerability results from the uncertainty caused by long years of occupation and disruptions to supply chains. At present, all goods need to be cleared by Israeli authorities, which can deter tourism and international investment.\nDespite the challenges, Ramallah is nowa relatively attractive place to do business. We have an opportunity to be more proactive about our economic objectives by clearly signalling to potential investors about our growth sectors and ensuring that this growth delivers social and environmental benefits, invests in our cultural assets, and reduces dependency on the donor community.\nOur cultural identity\nmust thrive in the face of challenges\nCultural heritage is much more multi-faceted than monuments and historical assets. For Ramallah, our tangible and intangible cultural heritage encompasses the city itself; our mountainous natural setting; traditions and rituals; religious institutions; past achievements, and even our shared experience of the ongoing political conflict.\nRamallah's long history has been influenced by a wide range of civilizations that have helped shape Palestinian culture. In the face of occupation, we see our culture as a crucial tool forasserting our own identityas a city-a place that treasures the values of diversity, inclusion, eguity, sustainable development, active citizenship, gender eguality and intellectual freedom. Many of these values date back to Ramallah's foundation and actively support our city's resilience.\nAs our three cities of Ramallah, Al-Bireh and Beitunia -which have differing socio-cultural histories - have begun to physically connect as one integrated urban area, we can face differences of opinion around shared cultural values. However, this is dwarfed by the challenge posed by occupation, which places constraints on freedom of expression and our ability to put legal frameworks in place to support this. It also limits public access to many cultural and natural assets that are important to Palestinians.\nThe resilience value of cultural assets\n\u2022\tA well-conserved natural and historic environment that draws on traditional knowledge and skills can considerably reduce vulnerability factors, as well as strengthening the resilience of communities to natural disasters\n\u2022\tCultural heritage makesa directand major contribution to economic developmentaround the world, providing significant employment\n\u2022\tCultural heritage can be a powerful mechanism for organising communities and supporting mental and spiritual wellbeing.\nTo help maximise these resilience benefits, Ramallah Municipality will develop an Integrated Cultural Strategy. It will create a clear vision and framework to support organisations within the city to integrate cultural considerations into their work. See page 112 for more detail.\nSource: UNESCO and World Heritage Centre\nWe also need to take into consideration the 26,000 refugees hat live in camps around our city region. Although there s complex politics around their assimilation and the 'right of return' to their original homes in historical Palestine, our efugees are affected by how our city develops and their voices need to be included in decision-making.\nResilient Ramallah 2050\nRamallah's perspective on the Athens Migration Exchange?\nWho?\n\u2022\tEight cities representing seven countries and 3 regions\n\u2022\t22 resilience practitioners, including 8 CROs and 14 city staff\n\u2022\t30 experts from businesses, NGOs, academia, local leadership and the 100RC Platform of Partners\nWhat?\n\u2022\t3 days of site visits, presentations and working sessions\n-\tDay 1 - Challenges: CROs shared their perspectives on the challenges at hand. A panel, including representatives of the migrant communityand local organizations, kicked offa series of site visits highlighting local approaches in Athens, such as its Relocation Scheme Program.\n-\tDay 2 - Solutions: multi-disciplinary groups worked around the themes of infrastructure, social cohesion and economic development, to arrive at new practices and solutions for managing urban migration while building resilience.\n-\tDay 3 - What's next? Teams distilled conclusions, leading to a set of promising practices to share with Mayors and the broader 100RC network. It was also decided to establish an ongoing Learning Community focused on cities and migration.\nWe are vulnerable to acute shocks and climate change\nRamallah is at risk from many shocks - relatively short events with potentially catastrophic impacts - including earthquakes, severe weather and political and social instability.\nRamallah sits within a seismically active area, with the Dead Sea Transform (the pointatwhich the African and Asian tectonic plates meet) running along the line of the Israel\/ Jordan border and the River Jordan. Major earthquakes hit the region in 1927 and 1943, and seismologists have concluded that another major event is statistically overdue. Although Ramallah does not sit within the highest risk areas, building codes for earthquake resilient design came into effect in 2016. There is concern that a major earthquake would cause significant damage to buildings and loss of lives.\nGiven the elevation of Ramallah, our city is also subject to winter snow storms and sudden heavy rain. These have been particularly disruptive in recentyears, interrupting electricity supplies, closing roads, and disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities such as our elderly and sick. As snow melts, this can cause surface flooding and overwhelm our drainage capacity.\nRamallah will face all these challenges in the context of increasing pressures from climate change. Research by the Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle (GLOWA) project found that the Palestinian territories can expect an increase in the freguency and duration of extreme droughts, leading to reduced recharge of groundwater bores, along with increased salinityand pumping costs.\nOccupation limits our options for adapting to these challenges; for example, we are not permitted to establish our own new sources of potable water. However, we have a long history of ingenuity and will look at all available options to meetthe needs of our people.\nLocal efforts to build resilience - Emergency Council\nThe Ramallah-AI-Bireh Governorate convenes an Emergency Council which aims to coordinate actions, share resources and provide support as needed from other stakeholders-this includes the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, police, transportation, fire, electricity, water and sewage network. Although not specifically reguired under the Local Authority Law, Ramallah Municipality has taken over additional responsibilities for emergency services and therefore is a key member of the Emergency Council.\nThe Emergency Council provides a great platform for us to build off in the future. However, much remains that can be done in the areas of risk mitigation and preparedness, as well as clarifying responsibilities for response and recovery. An important aspect is better integrating our efforts around disaster risk, with efforts in the city to tackle chronic stresses that reduce the capacity of Ramallah residents to withstand and bounce back from disruptive events.\nRamallah was selected from over 1100 applicants around the world tojoin the 100RC network.\nLaunch and Agenda Setting Workshop 18-19 September 2014\nInaugurated by Prime Minister Dr Rami Hamdallah, the Governor of Ramallah and Al-Bireh governorate, the Mayor, and other leaders within Ramallah's institutions.\nPHASE II: New analysis, opportunities and partnerships\nPHASE I: Establishing the foundation for building resilience\nResilience office January-February 2016\nOur CRO was selected and established the Resilience Office and team.\nResearch and consultation March-June 2016\nWorkshops, analysis and interviews to identify Ramallah's the critical infrastructure, stakeholder perceptions of resilience, and existing resiliencebuilding actions underway.\nPreliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA)\nJune 2016\nReleased the first ever summary of high level resilience challenges and opportunities for a Palestinian city.

The actionsare arranged under three strategic directions, each of which focuses on a different area where we need to focus our efforts if we are to achieve our 2050 vision for a Ramallah that is optimistic, sustainable, inclusive, proud of its own culture, and in control of its own destiny.\nEach strategic direction is underpinned by a series of more specific goals. While Ramallah Municipality will take a leading role in implementing many of the actions, all actions will reguire collaboration, and some will be led by other actors. In particular, our city's educational institutions, private sector organisations and NGOs hold significant expertise and knowledge about Ramallah that will be a crucial ingredient for successful implementation. Where possible, the actions in this Strategy build off the significant existing efforts of people leading the charge for resilience in Ramallah - specific examples of leading practice are highlighted throughout this section.\nResilience is an ongoing journey of adapting to a changing world. This means we need to continue developing innovative resilience-building actions for Ramallah and its surroundings. If you oryour organisation has any ideas for actions that align with our strategic priorities and goals, or would like to participate in any of the actions described in this Strategy, please contact cro@ramallah.DS.\n45\nHow to read our actions\nThe actions described will be implemented across different spatial scales and timeframes. Some actions are ready to be implemented right now, with the potential to deliver immediate benefits. Other actions may take longer to implement and reguire a staged approach, but with this investment comes the potential for truly transformative outcomes for an aspect of Ramallah's resilience.\nIn this section, transformative actions are described in the greatest detail - see belowfor an example. Full details of all actions are provided in the Action Implementation Summary on page 122.\nGoal 1: Reduce dependency on others for resources and mobility\nGoal 2: Use our land and resources to support the needs of our citizens\nGoal 3: Prioritise urban and economic development that supports resilience\nLocal efforts to build resilience - Joint Coordination Unit\nThe Joint Coordination Unit (JCU) was established in 2006 to help the three municipalities to coordinate efforts in tackling cross-boundary challenges, such as joint infrastructure, economic development and social services.\nThe ambition for coordination is to provide more cost-effective service delivery across waste management and transportation, as well as use the economies of scale of the three municipalities to more effectively access development funding. Achievements to date include:\n\u2022\tDevelopment of the Strategic Development Plan (2007-2011) and the Investment Plan\n\u2022\tJoint Service Solid Waste Plan\n\u2022\tTraffic and Transportation Plan.\n54\n55\nACTION 1: Develop comprehensive citywide environmental resource strategies for Energy, Water and Waste\nWe will develop an integrated group of strategies that support efficient ways of meeting the demand for natural resources in Ramallah and its surroundings. This will incorporate the expected effects of projected climate change, as well as forecast population and demographic changes. This will inform a program of specific, related sub-actions across the areas of Energy, Water and Waste, incorporating a mixture of technological and behavioural interventions.\nResilience Value\nAccounting for Ramallah's future natural resource needs will help us withstand disruption and adverse environmental impacts. The strategies will support experimentation and build resourcefulness within government, industry and households.\nLocal Efforts to Build Resilience - Supporting renewable energy\nEnergy security is of paramount importance.\nHowever, as development of strategic infrastructure is restricted, more localised solutions have to be found. We are working to reduce the energy demand of the city, such as through roll-out of low energy LED street lighting, and installing electricity generating photovoltaic (PV) cells on public buildings - including 15kw systems on the House of Expertise and Cultural Palace. With new rules that allow excess electricity generated to be sold backto the grid, and the falling cost of panels, PV is becoming more viable and we will support more widespread roll out.\nRelated CRF drivers\n\u2022\tFoster Long-Term and Integrated Planning\n\u2022\tEnsure Continuity of Critical Services\n\u2022\tProvide and Enhance Natural and Manmade Assets\n\u2022\tMeet Basic Needs\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality, JCU\nPartners\n\u2022\tJerusalem Water Board\n\u2022\tUniversities\n\u2022\tWaste management companies\n\u2022\tEnergy Authority\n\u2022\tKfW\n\u2022\tNGOs\n\u2022\tPalestine Water Authority (PWA)\n\u2022\tEnvironment Quality Authority\n\u2022\tJoint Service Council for Solid Waste Management\nACTION 1a: Building\nstakeholder outreach into\nwaste management research\nThis sub-action will extend an existing pilot study on household waste management being led by Ramallah Municipality. It will broaden the options being considered throughout produce life cycles, evaluate the overall impact of the social, economic and environmental impacts and engage more directly with communities to understand behaviours, stakeholder needs and adaptive capacity for new approaches.\nACTION 1b: Scale-up use\nof decentralized renewable energy approaches\nBuilding on the successful wide-spread distribution of solar heating systems across the city, Ramallah municipality will work to scale up the delivery of renewable energy infrastructure. This will be undertaken in collaboration with local partners to identify the most appropriate technologies and sites to accommodate increased capacity.\nACTION 1c: Work to remove barriers to developing an energy-from-waste facility\nGiven Ramallah's dual challenges with security of energy supply and waste disposal, the potential resilience value of this approach is high. This project will seek both successful examples and partners who can deliver this approach in a way that safeguards public health (e.g. appropriate air emissions). Specific considerations will include scale, technology, gasification, pyrolysis, permitting reguirements and financial viability.\nACTION 1d: Expand and\nimprove the wastewater\nsystem to cover all of\nRamallah\nIn accordance with international standards, Ramallah Municipality will work to expand existing sewerage network to cover the greater Ramallah expanding the waste water sewerage network and treatment plant capacity.\nACTION 1e: Develop pilot\nstudies designed to test\nmore diverse use of treated\nwastewater across Ramallah\nInvolving municipality, stakeholders, private sector, institutions and platform partners to test the potential for more diverse reuse of treated water in Ramallah, as well as Al-Bireh and Beitunia. We will look at opportunities for reuse within households, such as toilet flushing etc.\nACTION 1 f: Increase water\nresources\nA programme comprising multiple initiatives, including regulations reguiring rain-fed cisterns in new buildings; rehabilitating old pipe systems to reduce water loss; capacity building within the water authority to plan and manage water resources, and launch an international advocacy program to secure Palestinian access to its water resources that are currently controlled by Israel. The programme will be a coordinated effort between Ramallah Municipality and the water authority and will support the aim of Palestine's National Water Strategy to increase access and coverage to water for all uses, including tourism.\nACTION 1 g: Solid waste\nmanagement\nTo support the reuse ofwaste materialsand reduce the volume ofwaste going to landfill, the Joint Service Council (JSC) for Solid Waste Management will develop a feasibility study to understand the mix ofwaste arising, including municipal and commercial waste, construction and demolition waste, medical and hazardous waste, and waste tyres, in order to identify best practice approaches, technologies and sites for managing these volumes ofwaste. The study will focus on the three municipalities and will seek to identify partners to help deliver waste reuse and recovery facilities.\nACTION 1 h: Increase green\nspace in Ramallah\nLimited land, limited water resources, weak environmental regulations and an increase in construction are contributing to shrinkage of green areas in Ramallah and surroundings. The city also lacks also a comprehensive strategy or vision on how we can stop this decline, with inadeguate regulation exacerbating the problem. In response, this action will integrate maintenance and protection of green areas into the environmental by-laws, supported by an increased focus on enforcement through licencing reguirements, particularly in new urban areas. We will also trial use of treated waste water in green areas in the city.\nACTION 2: Encourage investment in Ramallah to reduce dependence on donor organizations\nRamallah, and the State of Palestine more broadly, has long received foreign investment from NGOs, philanthropic organisations and other donors. This has benefited our city and its resilience in many ways - critical assets such as roads, water and energy projects, have been delivered with this support from organisations. While the challenges facing our city mean that international aid will remain an important part of Ramallah's investment mix for the foreseeable future, our ongoing resilience reguires us to diversify approaches to funding and to reduce reliance on anyone source. Doing this reguires us to make better use of the resources at our disposal, including people of Palestinian heritage living overseas (i.e. \u2018the diaspora').\nThis action will see Ramallah Municipality partnerwith other municipalities in the region, as well as the Ramallah Federation - which represents around 50,000 people with descendants in Ramallah who currently live in the USA-to identify and target Palestinians in the diaspora who may be potential sources of investment in our area. We will draw on Ramallah's strength as the banking and finance sector's base in Palestine, seeking cooperation and sharing of data for mutual benefit.\nRamallah Municipality will take a targeted approach, providing candidates in the diaspora with information on the investment needs of the cityand its residents, example business cases for such investment, and practical assistance to streamline the investment process. Linked closely to Action 8 in this Strategy, this action is about Palestinians supporting Palestinians.\nResilience Value\nEncouraging investment into Ramallah will reduce dependency on the public sector and donor organisation funding, building self-sufficiency and providing an opportunity to attract home-grown talent back to Ramallah to learn from their international experience. It will also increase mutual communication between Ramallah and the Palestinian diaspora, thereby helping to build solidarity and shared identity in the face of challenges we face around self determination.\nRelated shocks and stresses\nRelated CRF drivers\n\u2022\tMeet Basic Needs\n\u2022\tSupport Livelihoods and Employment\n\u2022\tFoster Economic Prosperity\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tAl-Bireh and Beitunia Municipalities\n\u2022\tRamallah Federation\n\u2022\tBanking and Finance Sector organisations\n58\nACTION 3: Build resilience principles into the scoping and design of Ramallah's transport system\nRamallah is currently investigating major changes to its mobility systems, including establishing a formal public transport system and greater use of technology to improve traffic flows. A major component of the proposed approach is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. With careful system design and the right features, like automated ticketing and priority traffic lighting, BRT approaches can deliver fast, reliable and comfortable services that serve as a viable alternative to private vehicle travel.\nAs Ramallah currently lacks formal public transport, this would be a major shiftfor our cityand reguires a comprehensive feasibility and planning study. There is a major opportunity to maximize the cross-cutting benefits (as well as to reduce unintended adverse conseguences) by building more explicit resilience-based criteria into this study. Key considerations will include providing eguitable access to the system, including vulnerable populations; ensuring system flexibility and redundancy that reduce disruption, and understanding the possible conseguences for Ramallah's existing shared taxi providers.\nResilience Value\nThis action will help improve mobilityforall Ramallah residents, including vulnerable groups such as women who do not feel safe using the current shared taxi system. If successful, it will help reduce traffic volumes in the central city; improve air guality and liveability; encourage greater social cohesion through more communal travel; improve the experience of tourists, and increase accessibility of transport to vulnerable populations. It will also build capacity within the municipality around applying resilience principles in business case development and infrastructure design.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tAcademic sector\n\u2022\tSpecialist transport consultant\n\u2022\tCommunity members\nACTION 3a: Run car-free\ndays with free public\ntransport and cultural\nactivities in central Ramallah\nRamallah Municipality will collaborate with local businesses and relevant authorities to plan and run car-free days in central Ramallah, incorporating lessons learned from other cities in the 100RC network, such as Bogota (Colombia), Paris (France) and Mexico City (Mexico). The car-free day will include cultural events and be supported by a day of public transportation, helping to promote its benefits. The day will also include close monitoring and evaluation of how residents respond, including their usage patterns for the public transport, which can help inform any future network.\nInitial car-free days will be established on festival days, feast days and National days, where overall traffic levels are lower. This will gradually extend to other days with higher traffic volumes - in the first year we will target 24 free-car days, with the potential to scale up in future years depending on outcomes.\n59\n\n\nACTION 4: Develop an integrated and comprehensive community health and safety service\nThe increase in the population of Ramallah and surroundings has not been accompanied by development of sufficient health and social infrastructure. Available public health services are not adequate or universally accessible, and there is poor integration with secondary and tertiary health services that focus on prevention. A particular gap exists with ouryouth, who lackadequate programs around issues such as reproductive and sexual health, nutrition, smoking and drug use. These shortcomings leave residents and visitors vulnerable to different health and safety threats; for example, Ramallah has high incidences of psychosocial stress and non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer, diabetes, vascular diseases).\nThis action involves development of a comprehensive public and family health service for Ramallah and its surroundings. Comprising newfacilitiesand programmes, it will integrate:\n\u2022\tPsychosocial support services for people suffering from stress\n\u2022\tScreening and early detection of people at risk (e.g. cancer screening; genetic services)\n\u2022\tTraining of health and social cadres in comprehensive primary health care\n\u2022\tAyouth health program, including education and counselling on nutritional and behavioural determinants of health\n\u2022\tA follow-up and specialist referral system\n\u2022\tEfficient and effective information and financial systems\n\u2022\tUse of healthcare to reach out and increase engagement with youth and marginalized population groups.\nThe action proposes a revolutionary new model where our city's public health system exists under the umbrella of Ramallah Municipality Health and Environment Department.\nHowever, Ramallah Municipality cannot deliver this alone -active participation and partnership will be required with the National Ministries of Health and Social Development, along with the academic sector, World Bank and local NGOs currently working to improve health outcomes in Ramallah and its surroundings.\nWe hope that, in time, this project will serve as a model for other cities in Palestine.\nResilience Value\nThis approach will provide a more resourceful, robust and flexible healthcare system. It will reduce demands on the system due to preventable and chronic conditions, and provide improved level of care to more residents by minimizing the need for sick I injured people to travel over great distances to receive treatment.\nIt will also decrease the pressure and dependency on the Red Crescent by increasing the capacity of community members in providing initial response first aid, as well as developing an understanding of treating minor health care issues. Better and more holistic health services can also make Ramallah a more attractive city in which to live and invest.\nRelated shocks and stresses\nRelated CRF drivers\n\u2022\tMeets Basic Needs\n\u2022\tEnsures Public Health Services\n\u2022\tPromote Cohesive and Engaged Communities\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality Health and Environment Department\nPartners\n\u2022\tMinistry of Health\n\u2022\tMinistry of Education and Higher Education\n\u2022\tMinistry of Social Development\n\u2022\tAcademic organizations\n\u2022\tMain Health and psychosocial NGOs\n\u2022\tWorld Bank\n\u2022\tPalestinian National Public Health Institute\n\u2022\tYouth Centers\nNGOs\nACTION 5: Establish municipal policy to encourage affordable housing delivery models\nRamallah and surrounding municipalities will form a working group to establish policies that encourage trials of different models for delivering affordable housing in accessible areas of Ramallah. This will consider affordability notjust at point of purchase, but also in terms of long-term operating costs for residents (e.g. proximity to work and transport, energy efficiency).\nInternational leading practices will be considered, including incentive zoning, rebates and shared ownership models.\nThe longer-term aim is for successful pilot projects to inform future development models that meetthe demands of Ramallah's growing population, including those in vulnerable segments of the community.\nResilience Value\nSafe, robust, appropriate and affordable housing supports the capacity of residents to work and socialize in ways that build healthier communities and economic growth. Providing more people with robust homes also increases the city's resilience to shock events, such as earthguakes and heatwaves.\nDelivery lead\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tAl-Bireh and Beitunia Municipalities\n\u2022\tMinistry of Housing and Public Works\n\u2022\tPrivate developers\n\u2022\tPalestinian Contractors'Union.\nInspiration from San Francisco - Affordable Housing\nBonus Program\nHousing prices in San Francisco, USA, have undergone significant growth in recentyears. Between 2011 and 2013, the average price of housing increased by 44.9%, while average monthly rents increased by 28.3%. This has reguired the City and County of San Francisco to consider its role in promoting more affordable housing for its residents.\nOne such approach is the Affordable Housing Bonus Program, which provides incentives for developers to include more affordable housing for very low-, low-, moderate- and middle-income households. Projects considered under this program will also need to consider the broader resilience value of the proposed development-they may not demolish any existing residential units, as well as providing open space and other community amenities that support healthy and prosperous communities.\nRamallah will collaborate with San Francisco and other cities in the 100RC network as we develop our own approaches to encourage more affordable housing.\nACTION 6: Collect comprehensive data on Ramallah's transient population to inform future planning and service provision\nAs an employment hub and attractive service center for surrounding Palestinian areas, many people come to work and socialize in Ramallah. A challenge is howto provide services for this growing number of visitors and residents when most are not reguired to make a financial contribution to service delivery.\nAt present we don't know enough about this transient population. This action will better guantify the size and demands of this group, which will the Municipality to help determine and trial different models through which they can contribute to sustainable service provision.\nDelivery lead\nRamallah Municipality, JCU\nPartners\n\u2022\tDistrict Traffic Council\n\u2022\tUniversities\n\u2022\tNGOs already undertaking outreach\n\u2022\tMinistry of Transport\nRamallah Municipality will collaborate with organisations who currently hold separate datasets on the transient population, including Al-Bireh and Beitunia municipalities, educational institutions, the Ministry of Transportation, and NGOs. This will be combined with new data gathered through approaches such as surveys and traffic counting.\nResilience Value\nThis action supports evidence-based decision-making for future city planning. It responds to increasing urbanisation and new ways of living in Ramallah and its surroundings, introducing new ways to generate the revenue reguired to not only meetthe basic needs of residents, but also support economic development.\nACTION 7: Reform and implementation of environmental regulations in Palestine\nRamallah Municipality will collaborate with adjacent municipalities around shared environmental challenges, developing a new legal framework for environmental protection in the region, as well as increasing the emphasis on enforcement. Together, we will use this work in our metropolitan region to advocate for stronger laws, regulations and specifications across to be applied across Palestine from the National level.\nThe immediate focus ofthisaction will be on the region's key issue of waste disposal and management (including hazardous wastes). This issue has flow-on effects in a range of areas, such as air guality, water guality and public health.\nResilience Value\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality, Al-Bireh & Beitunia Municipalities, Ministry of Agriculture, media and private sector\nPartners\n\u2022\tUniversities\n\u2022\tSpecialist consultants\n\u2022\tJCU\nStrengthening the regulatory framework will support fairer outcomes, reduce environmental degradation and improve public health. It can also help safeguard ecosystem services and raises awareness of environmental protection among industry and the general public.\n\nACTION 8: Establish a Local Economic Development Framework that supports sectors with the greatest potential for sustainable growth\nAlthough Ramallah's economy has grown quickly since becoming the seat of the Palestinian National Authority, investment from both the private sector and donor community has freguently been reactive and not always linked to the needs of the city. We will build on our status to develop a more coordinated Local Economic Development Framework to proactively attract investment that not only bolsters our economy, but also supports a strong society.\nThe municipality will work more closely with the private sector, donor community, neighbouring municipalities and National Government to develop a clear forward plan for economic development. We will undertake a comprehensive review of the economic development policy approach for Ramallah, to identify Local Economic Development Framework models which are best suited to the Ramallah context and to help develop an evidence-based framework to support growth in the tourism, industry and trade and the knowledge economy and education. These priority sectors were identified through economic analysis undertaken by our partner AECOM during the Resilience Strategy development process.\nThe Local Economic Development Framework will include a formal \u2018capital projects pipeline' that provides a long list of potential projects - from expression of interest to full business case stages. This is closely linked to Action 9, which will develop transparent appraisal criteria to help prioritize use of our limited resources towards projects that are likely to deliver the greatest economic impact and broader societal benefits. Major projects will reguire independent feasibility assessments to ensure that they are viable, sustainable, do not impact detrimentally on current or other planned activities, and provide guantified benefits that meetthe identified needs of the residents.\nResilience Value\nFocuses on delivering projects more tailored to Ramallah's needs and can reduce dependency on donor-funding cycles.

The guidelines will ensure thatthe business cases for investment in capital projects maximise potential co-benefits helps project proponents identify unintended conseguences, and demonstrate to insurers and investors that risks and opportunities have been considered early in the project development process.\nDrawing on best practices sourced from within and outside the 100RC network, initially the guidelines will be trialled by the municipality on a future capital project such as a new road or municipal building. Following evaluation of the initial trial, the audience for the guidelines will be expanded to include private developers and National projects occurring within Ramallah.\nResilience Value\nProviding clear guidance to decision-makers and investors will foster long-term and integrated planning grounded in evidenceand resilience principles.

It was expanded in 2014 to invite participation from nonprivate sector partners, along a \u2018Cities 4P' principle incorporating public, private and people (citizen) engagement in a partnership model for collaborative working. In 2015, the success of the project and the reach of its engagement saw it officially adopted by the Wilaya of Grand Casablanca as the basis of an official Smart City policy.\nToday, the function of e-Medina is to:\n\u2022\tIdentify priority smart city projects for Casablanca\n\u2022\tReview project funding and financing options\n\u2022\tHelp develop and review project business cases\n\u2022\tMonitor project progress against indicators and initial objectives.\nACTION 10: Develop and promote resilient urban design guidelines\nRamallah Municipality will prepare guidelines on\nimproving resilience through the design and form of urban developments. Supplementing mandatory building scale control and building on the emerging Palestine Green Building Code and City Resilience Framework, these guidelines will guide more strategic development of residential and mixed use schemes covering issues such as public open space, earthguake vulnerability, onsite water capture and reuse, and passive design solutions.\nThe Municipality Building Permits and Licencing department will lead the development of the guidelines in collaboration with the Association of Engineers. Representatives from the developer community will also be invited to shape the development of the guidelines so that the barriers and opportunities for delivering more resilient development, both from a technical as well as economic perspective, are reflected.\nThe Municipality will promote the use of the guidelines for major development and reguire applications for major building permits to demonstrate how they have taken the guidelines into consideration.\nResilience Value\nThe new guidance will set the benchmarkfor more resilient urban development in Palestine. It will provide clarity to developers as to the forms of development expected in Ramallah as well as practical approaches, based on best practice, as to how these can be achieved. This means delivering more developments that are safe and provide for the needs of communities, including shared spaces that encourage social cohesion.

While development will be led bya private developer partner, Ramallah will mandate a set of guiding resilience principles to be trialled. The emerging Palestine Green Building Code, and leading practices from other cities. Key components will be citizen participation in development decision-making and human-centred design.\nThe action will partner with local academic institutions to establish an analytical framework to test the costs and benefits of different aspects of the development. The project will test and feed into the guidelines for resilient urban development described in Action 10, and lessons learnt can inform future development activities elsewhere in Palestine.\nResilience Value\nWill provide an inclusive neighbourhood where end users' needsare considered atall stages ofthe development process.

Achieving this highly collaborative future could be truly transformative for Ramallah and its surroundings, but such a fundamental shift will take time. Collaboration needs to include localities and cities that surround Ramallah region and could in time form an integrated metropolitan area. This action proposes the following staged actions:\n1.\tUndertake an evaluation of the past and current approaches to collaboration between Ramallah municipality and others partners, including through the Joint Coordination Unit, the Joint Service Council for Waste Management, and the Emergency Council amongst others. This analysis will provide an assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, lessons learned and recommended strategies to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of cross boundary working.\n2.\tBuilding on the recommendations of stage 1, develop a road map for improving regional collaboration that defines the function, scope, responsibilities and performance metrics for working with partners.\n3.\tImplement the road map and formalise working relationships in orderto achieving better collaborations with other partners. Prioritise cross boundary projects and allocate appropriate human resources and capacity building reguired to support the newjoint working relationships.\nResilience Value\nThis is a cross-cutting opportunity for Ramallah and surrounding municipalities.

However, issues such as resource constraints, time pressures and a limited culture of strategic coordination make this difficult for municipal departments, which typically need to focus their efforts on dealing with immediate and short-term issues.\nThese existing challenges will be increased as Ramallah Municipality takes on a leading role in developing the resilience of our region. Effectively leading change, both within and outside the municipality, will reguire a rethink of our governance structure and organizational culture.\nTo bridge this critical gap, the municipality needs to develop its core functions in planning, management and leadership; implementing and monitoring resilience strategy actions; and mobilising, managing and guiding other external partners. This will be advanced through the following activities:\n\u2022\tBuilding on existing workto map organisational responsibilities and undertaking a comprehensive capacity analysis of the municipality, including roles, functions, decision making processes, workflows, feedback mechanisms, financial and human resources. This will\nbe used to understand gaps that need to be filled to facilitate Ramallah Municipality leading the regional change management process for resilience.\n\u2022\tEstablishing a specific unit within Ramallah Municipality to support existing units, set strategic indicators, mobilize 100RC Platform Partners and additional donors, and undertake overarching monitoring, coordination and annual reporting on municipal performance. It will also oversee implementation of the actions within the Resilient Ramallah 2050 Strategy, which will reguire liaison with stakeholders at the city, Governorate, National, private sector, academic and community levels. Additionally, it will undertake capacity building within the municipality\naround resilience principles, ensuring ongoing effective engagement with the 100RC network.\n\u2022 The action to establish an evidence-based performance system for the municipality will sit with this unit (see Action 15) in partnership with the Ramallah Municipality IT Department.\nResilience Value\nSupports integration of resilience principles and\ncoordination between municipal departments. This will improve resourcefulness by identifying interdependencies and opportunities for cross-cutting benefits. Annual public reporting can increase public awareness and trust in municipal activities.

The session will be used to share knowledge and lessons learnt with other Palestinian cities, such as Nablus (which is active in the UNISDR Making Cities Resilient Programme) and Hebron, encouraging and supporting them to produce their own resilience strategies. This forum will position Ramallah as a leader in Resilience thinking across Palestine, and help integrate resilience principles into the National Ministry of Local Government.\nWhen planning the National Resilience Forum will drawon 100RC's experience in convening different stakeholders to build capacity around resilience.\nResilience Value\nBuilds knowledge and capacity around resilience and integrated disaster management, both within Ramallah and beyond.

One of the drivers for this isa lack of any transparent system for tracking and reporting on the outcomes of municipal and city decision-making and investments - along with performance of its leaders and staff. This can lead to politicized decision-making, foster a sense of distrust in municipal activities, and result in missed opportunities to refine and improve decision-making based on past experiences.\nThis action will take a comprehensive inventory of data held by the city and develop a set of municipal performance indicators with urban resilience principles embedded.\nThey will incorporate key principles from the City Resilience Framework and UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Ramallah, and Palestine more broadly, does not have a centuries-old tradition of democratic governance, meaning neither citizens or institutions are accustomed to two-way dialogue and participatory planning approaches. Achieving change in this area will be a long-term exercise in shifting cultural attitudes and expectations within communities, as well as modifying historic approaches and procedures in organisations like Ramallah Municipality.\nRamallah Municipality will establish a 10year plan of action for greater community engagement in government decisionmaking, initially atthe municipal level. Using international frameworks such as the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) spectrum, it will plan out the long-term objectives for increasing stakeholder participation, along with the mixture of approaches to be trialled in support of these objectives. Engagement mechanisms are expected to use a range of media, varying from surveys and social media, to public meetings, focus groups, television advertising and trials of participatory budgeting.\nWhile this longer term plan is being established, we will commence with tangible initiatives to build greater stakeholder engagement and participation - see actions 17 and 18 opposite.\nResilience Value\nImproves social cohesion and empowers communities to participate in civic decision-making.

This can support service provision and asset delivery that better responds to end-user needs.\nACTION 18: Establish Neighbourhood Committees\nThis action will promote an inclusive culture and citizen responsibility by electing committees of community members for different neighbourhoods in the city. Ramallah Municipality will partnerwith trusted NGOs to help promote committees and elect members through a transparent and fair selection procedure that incorporates a truly representative sample of from participating communities (including an eguitable gender distribution).\nCommittees would become the reference body that interact with city officials and institutions on local issues. They will have clearly established mandates, obligations and responsibilities. A longerterm aim isforthese committees to lead development of community resilience plans, in which neighbourhoods will be able to collectively set their own priorities and allocate resources to manage hazards.\nResilience Value\nImproves social cohesion and empowers communities to participate in civic decision making, as well as establishing trusted points of contact in local communities.

However, for each hazard, the potential exposure and vulnerability of our communities and infrastructure varies widely across the city.\nThis action will provide a comprehensive assessment of the spatial relationships between a range of major shocks and the vulnerability of different people to these events.\nFor example, this will include the likely ground acceleration rates, areas of liquefaction and landslide zones associated with earthquakes, as well as vulnerable buildings at risk of collapse. This will be considered alongside demographic, economic and health data to better understand potential coping capacities of different communities.\nUnderstanding how risks are distributed spatially across the city will aid the broader integrated disaster management actions in this strategy and aligns with several ofthe Global Goals under the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The action can also inform scenario testing and planning for emergency events, as well as helping decision makers to identify and prioritize key sites for redevelopment.\nResilience Value\nWill support more efficient and effective use of limited resources for risk mitigation and preparedness.

These sessions will simulate relevant real life situations to help those in emergency management to understand their roles and responsibilities in the immediate response and longer term recovery. Events will cover different types of scenario, including earthguakes, blizzards, disease pandemics and civil unrest.\nPlanning of these events will learn from leading practices elsewhere in the world. This includes the 100RC cities of San Francisco and Wellington, both of which are recognized as leaders in emergency management and are at significant risk of a major seismic event.\nResilience Value\nThese sessions will provide a safe space to practice for real life emergencies, ensuring improving effectiveness of response and recovery. They will also help identify mitigation and preparedness measures that can be implemented to reduce risk exposure.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality, JCU\nPartners\n\u2022\tNational Disaster Risk Management Committee\n\u2022\tLocal municipalities\n\u2022\tPalestinian Red Crescent and other emergency response agencies\nACTION 21: Assist local institutions to integrate disaster risk management in organizational practices and business processes\nRamallah Municipality will work with other municipalities in Ramallah-AI-Bireh Governorate to identify best practice and develop a programme on integrating disaster risk management into practices and business processes.\nThe programme will be offered to major city businesses\/ institutions with a role to play in disaster resilience. For example, following a disruptive event, banks have a role to play in keeping our financial systems active and hotels may be valuable as safe gathering places.\nResilience Value\nWhile this will reguirean initial investment, inthe longerterm, building capacity within institutions to effectively manage their own risk exposure will save resources and reduce the potential for reliance on municipal assistance in the event major shock. It will also be a valuable opportunity to influence the National approach and agenda for disaster risk management.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality, Joint Coordination Unit\nPartners\n\u2022\tAl-Bireh and Beitunia Municipalities\n\u2022\tNational Disaster Risk Management Committee\n\u2022\tLocal municipalities\n\u2022\tPalestinian Red Crescent\n\u2022\tMajor city businesses\/institutions\n\u2022\tUNDP\nACTION 22: Support local businesses and institutions with continuity planning\nThe circumstances of Ramallah and its surrounding have required greatadaptability and resilience from businesses and institutions, which are regularly subject to service disruptions. However, Ramallah's many small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) remain especially vulnerable and may find it difficult to recover from a major shock such as an earthquake or prolonged electricity outage.\nThis pilot project will increase the level of continuity planning support provided to Ramallah's businesses and institutions. We will work with 10 organisations to help them produce simple but effective plans that consider their supply chain and establish contingency measures they can apply in the event ofa shock. This will enable them to continue operating or to resume operations more quickly. There is the opportunity to scale up this pilot program in the future.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022 Universities\n\u2022\tLocal banks\n\u2022\tDistrict-level councils\n\u2022\tLocal businesses\n\u2022\t100RC network.\nResilience Value\nThis action helps keep critical services available and the economy functioning following shockevents. Business continuity planning can also help businesses identify ways to improve their operations in good times.\nInspiration from Wellington - Business Continuity\nPlanning\nWellington is located in one of the most seismically active locations in the world, so helping businesses plan for earthquakes is crucial to its resilience.\nRealising that most small businesses don't have the time or resources to do detailed business continuity planning, Wellington Region Emergency Management Office (WREMO) has developed and delivered quick and simple two hour workshops that can rapidly advance levels of flexibility and adaptability when a disruptive event does strike.\nResilient Ramallah will learn from Wellington as we implement Action 22. You can learn more about Wellington's approachat http:\/\/www.getprepared.orq.nz\/businesses.\n90\nACTION 23: Establish an effective early warning system for a variety of risks and hazards\nRamallah, and Palestine more broadly, is making good strides in emergency response. The Municipality has established a disaster response center and supporting procedures, but more needs to be done to provide early warning of impending shocks.\nDelivery leads\nEmergency Council\nPartners\nThis action will develop and implement a warning system covering both predictable and more unpredictable disaster events, with the aim of reaching the largest number of people possible. A major challenge for this will be how to effectively warn the large number of people not registered in the city, but who may be present during the daytime. It will therefore be important for this work to link with Action 6, which aims to better define and understand Ramallah's transient population.\n\u2022\tRamallah Municipality\n\u2022\tNational DRM Committee\nThis action supports Global Goal 7 of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction: \"Substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030.\"\nResilience Value\nThis action will provide clear communication that allows affected residents to respond effectively to a shock event. It can also reduce response times for emergency services and enable protective measures for buildings and infrastructure to be put into place. This will support continuity of critical services, guicker recovery and provide greater confidence to potential investors.\nGoal 8: Make effective use of our intellectual and cultural capital within the country and across the globe\nGoal 9: Empower our citizens to help improve their own resilience\nGoal 10: Document and celebrate our culture, heritage and commitment to welcoming all\nGoal 11: Invest in smart city approaches that support community resilience.\nACTION 24: Link higher education with the private sector\nEconomic projections developed by AECOM predict that over the next 20 years an additional 76,000 new jobs will\nbe required just to keep unemployment at the current\nrate - 7.9% across the three cities and 17.7% across the Governorate.\nIn 2014, the unemployment rate among new graduates across the West Bank between 20 and 29 years that hold associate diploma certificates or higher was 42.3%. This partly reflects a mismatch of skills required by local industries\nand those being generated by the education sector, which\nis somewhat driven by a weak culture around student job placements, internships and residency programs. Moreover, vocational courses are often gendered and not available for girls. This is exacerbated by social norms and expectations about what is an appropriate profession for a woman, outright excluding women from a number of professions.\nAs a major center for university education in Palestine, Ramallah has a major role to play in addressing these challenges. This will happen through multiple approaches:\n\u2022\tMarket analysis of future jobs and skills needed in different\nemployment categories, as well as alignment with market needs\n\u2022\tEvaluating the scientific and technical capacity of higher\neducation to deliver the desired competencies and skills\n\u2022\tDesigning student work experience and residency programs for local university students, enabling direct collaboration between universities and major employers\nwithin Ramallah and its surroundings. The program will be\nsupported by ongoing mentoring following graduation, along with a concerted emphasis on gender equity in\nemployment. Ramallah municipality can coordinate such\ncollaborations through its partnership with the different sectors in the city, with support from Ministries of Finance, Economic Development and Labour. We will coordinate with the World Bank, which is leading a similar project.\nResilience Value\nSupports livelihoods and employment by better matching\ngraduates' skills with industry needs. This will support\neconomic development, help retain locally educated\ntalent, unlock fresh thinking and innovation, and build more meaningful collaborations between the business and academic sectors.\nRelated shocks and stresses\nRelated CRF drivers\n\u2022\tSupport livelihoods and employme nt\n\u2022\tEmpower a broad range of stakeholders\n\u2022\tFoster economic priority\nDelivery leads\nLocal universities\nPartners\n\u2022\tWorld Bank\/Social Finance\n\u2022\tPrivate sector firms\n\u2022\tNGOs\n\u2022\tRamallah Municipality\nACTION 25: Plan and develop the Ramallah Tech Park\nIn recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic breakthrough in Ramallah's private sector economy. However, levels of investment are beginning to stagnate and the number of university graduates exceedsjob opportunities. Start-up businesses are an important part of the solution to these challenges-since 2014, over 600jobswere created by startups in Ramallah. Today, they account for 34% of the total employment of the ICT sector.\nWe will further support start-ups by establishing Ramallah TechPark, which will be revolutionary in Palestine. The TechParkwill allowyoung professionals-especially university graduates from the IT and Business departments - to come together with investors and experts to create new business models and technical solutions to challenges facing Ramallah, Palestine and the region more broadly.\nRamallah Municipality has identified a planned appropriate space for the project, which will be delivered in partnership with the Leaders Organization. The TechPark is an important step to branding Ramallah as an innovation and entrepreneurship city that inspires future generations of entrepreneurs in Palestine.\nResilience Value\nSupports innovation and entrepreneurship to improve employment outcomes and generate investment in the region's economy. The action can also improve gender eguity-while women account for 16%ofthe Ramallah labour force, the participation rate is 31% in start-ups.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tLeaders Organization\n\u2022\tPITA\n\u2022\tMinistry of Telecommunicationsand IT\n\u2022\tUtility providers\n\u2022\tPrivate telecommunication companies\n\u2022\tPrivate sector investors\nLocal efforts to build resilience - 'FastForward Accelerator'\nDeveloped by the Leaders Organisation, FastForward is Palestine's first start-up accelerator. Since its establishment in 2013, FastForward has supported twelve companies to grow from idea to business. Over a period of four months, the program provides motivated start-ups with seed funding of US$20,000, along with office space and technology, access to highly experienced mentors, one-on-one sessions with experts from professional sectors, and relevant training courses.\nACTION 26: Establish a coordinated vision for Ramallah's tourism industry\nWith good proximity to the globally important historic sites at Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and a vibrant social and cultural scene with strong hospitality assets, tourism is a key growth sector in Ramallah. The discovery of Khirbet el Tireh - an ancient site of religious significance within a few kilometres of Ramallah -also has great potential to increase levels of religious tourism in our city.\nLinking with the Municipal Tourism Strategy that was recently developed, this project seeks to establish a long-term vision for tourism that is coordinated with, and actively supported by, efforts at the Governorate and National levels. The approach needs to include consistent external messaging; areas for priority development; potential risks; and future skills\/infrastructure needs. It will also consider how tourism including cultural industry can provide critical support in times of emergency through the use of their facilities and resources (e.g. spare rooms, bilingual staff).\nResilience Value\nThis action can support economic growth and local jobs while helping to minimize the unintended adverse conseguences that can come from rapid development of tourism in a city. It will also support improved emergency response through innovative use of existing resources in Ramallah.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tMinistry of Culture\n\u2022\tMinistry of Tourism and Antiguities\n\u2022\tJCU\nCultural institutes\nMajor tourism providers in city (e.g. hotels) Private sector investors\nACTION 2 7: Provide community groups with vacant or underused space or assets where they can shape new gathering and creative spaces\nMany Ramallah residents are not fully aware of their rights to access to public space. Additionally, constraints on Palestinian-controlled land mean there is limited spare public land available for municipal parks and meeting places. However, Ramallah does have significant tracts of vacant, privately-owned space.\nThis action will identify locations within Ramallah that have the highest potential as public gathering and creative spaces. Considering both municipal and disused private land, it will determine opportunities for land to be provided to community groups to use spaces - either on a temporary or longer-term basis-fora range of activities such as arts and crafts villages or pocket parks. Ramallah Municipality will support participating community groups by negotiating with private landholders and simplifying any permitting or approvals processes.\nIn addition to vacant land, the project will look at options for underused assets and spaces (e.g. walls, water tanks, theatres) that can be used for installations such as murals, sculptures and performance pieces. Installations that support messages of acceptance and resilience will be prioritized.\nResilience Value\nRelated shocks and stresses\nRelated CRF drivers\n\u2022\tEmpower a Broad Range of Stakeholders\n\u2022\tPromote Cohesive and Engaged Communities\n\u2022\tProvide and Enhances Protective Natural and Man-Made Assets\nDelivery lead\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tCommunity groups\n\u2022\tNGOs\n\u2022\tDiaspora\nThis action will improve community facilities and increase natural capital in the city. By giving community groups an opportunity to develop these spaces, it will also build pride, community cohesion and awareness of civil rights.\nCollaborating with Pittsburgh - creating spaces for people\nWhen developing its resilience strategy, Pittsburgh in the USA realised that its tracts of vacantand underused land present a major opportunity to generate valuable community assets. Pittsburgh is currently implementing a program to repurpose some of this land to provide space for uses like recreation, urban agriculture, stormwater capture and public are.\nAs we implement Action 27 in this strategy, we will share knowledge and experiences with Pittsburgh, along with other cities in the network that are pursuing similar approaches.\nACTION 28: Partner with the insurance sector to understand barriers to insurance in Ramallah, build awareness and develop new products to address the gap\nUntil 2004, Palestine lacked insurance lawand hence the industry was highly disorganized. The industry has since begun to grow due to the establishment of an insurance regulator - the Palestine Capital Market Authority (PCMA) -and the enactment of the Insurance Law 2005. Despite this, levels of public awareness and uptake of small business and general insurance (e.g. home, contents and car) policies remain low. This leaves many Ramallah residents at risk of being unable to resume a comparable guality of life following a disruptive event, and can also have significant negative effects on economic activity.\nRamallah Municipality will collaborate with insurance companies to raise awareness about the benefits of insurance and reduce the barriers to general insurance uptake among Ramallah businesses, individuals and institutions. This will take inspiration from successful international models, where effective products have been developed to respond to the needs of uninsured or underinsured people. This will include looking for mechanisms to recognize the benefit of prevention, mitigation and adaptation measures within insurance policy, such as resilience bonds.\nResilience Value\nBefore a disaster strikes, insurance pricing gives policy holders incentives to reduce their exposures through risk mitigation measures. In the aftermath, insurance transfers the fiscal burden away from taxpayers, onto the private sector and into international capital markets. Developing products through partnerships and informed by meaningful stakeholder input can maximize uptake and resilience benefits.\nRelated shocks and stresses\nRelated CRF drivers\n\u2022\tSupport livelihoods and employment\n\u2022\tMeet basic needs\n\u2022\tEnsure social security, stability andjustice\n\u2022\tEnsure continuity of critical services\n\u2022\tEmpower a broad range of stakeholders\nDelivery lead\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tPalestine Capital Market Authority\n\u2022\tInsurance industry partner\n\u2022\tNGOs currently engaging with communities\nInspiration from Melbourne - Innovative Insurance\nDespite being a wealthy country, there are many Australian adults who are unable to afford conventional insurance for their home, contents and care, or the level of cover available is too high for their need.\nIn response, Good Shepherd Microfinance collaborated with the insurance firm Suncorp to design an innovative insurance scheme that provides basic, affordable and accessible home and contents and car insurance to low-income people. The product is based on direct consultation with the target market to understand their needs-this helped Suncorp tailor the product and ensure that users did not have to pay more for a level of cover they don't need.\nInterestingly, it was found that basic car insurance was critical to resilience of many low-income people. This is because low-income communities often had poor access to public transport, so losing their car would make it difficult for them to access employment and services.\nACTION 29: Ensure safe working conditions for all\nThe construction sector has grown steadily in Ramallah, but this has occurred without matching improvement in licensing and occupational health and safety regulation.\nThe result has been a high rate of incidents, most of which go undocumented due to the lack of a formal reporting and investigation system run by the National Government, Ramallah Municipality or Union of Palestinian Workers. These incidents range from minor injuries and chemical spills, through to large pollution events and occasional deaths. Some residents of Ramallah and its surroundings also take employment in construction projects in Israel, where injuries are common and deaths have been known to occur.\nWhile the Ministry of Labour is mandated to monitor compliance with labour laws by contractors, at present there is a lack of resourcing. In an attempt to play a greater role in enforcement, Ramallah Municipality has developed new licensing procedure and supporting guidelines for construction firms.\nThis action will build on these licensing and guidelines in several ways:\n\u2022\tA review of safety and health guidelines for construction workers in the city, drawing on other cities' experiences of enforcing workers' safety, both within our region (e.g. Amman) and elsewhere\n\u2022\tAn increased focus from the Municipality on agreements, licensing and education around safe work practices\n\u2022\tMandating construction companies operating in the city to insure workers against potential risks and dangers\n\u2022\tPartnership between Ministry of Labour and Ramallah Municipality to more efficiently enforce labour law and practices\n\u2022\tAwareness and education of contractors and workers on their legal rights and responsibilities, led by public safety committee at the Ramallah-AI-Bireh Governorate level\n\u2022 Developing a more effective monitoring system with adeguate and well-trained inspectors, reporting system for registering new cases, and smart electronic monitoring of incidents, along with follow-up on corrective and preventative actions. This system will be developed by Ramallah Municipality with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders.\nResilience Value\nThis action supports improved public health outcomes and reduced environmental degradation. It can create new employment in the field of OHS managementand improve Ramallah's reputation internationally, making it a more attractive place for investment and supporting sustainable economic growth.\nRelated shocks and stresses\nRelated CRF drivers\n\u2022\tSupport livelihoods and employment\n\u2022\tEnsure social stability, security andjustice\n\u2022\tFoster economic prosperity\n\u2022\tPromote leadership and effective management\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tMinistry of Labor\n\u2022\tUnion of Palestinian workers\n\u2022\tConstruction Firms\nWorkers\nACTION 30: Prepare physical and online support resources to residents of Ramallah and its surroundings\nThis action involves preparing physical and online resources for new residents to encourage them to become productive and engaged members of the community. This is expected to include welcome information packs, assistance registering with necessary agencies and services, emergency management information, and community group information packs. A foundational step of this process will be collaborating with the holders of demographic data to understand who is newto the cityand could benefit from this assistance.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tNGOs already undertaking outreach\n\u2022\tAl-Bireh and Beitunia Municipalities\n\u2022\tNational Government\nResilience Value\nIncreases community understanding of available resources, disaster management processes and potential hazards within the city. Supports communities in managing issues themselves and helps improve social cohesion and community engagement with the municipality.\nACTION 31: Integrate cultural awareness into organisational practices\nRamallah Municipality is working ongoing develop an Integrated Cultural Strategy. It will create a clear vision for promoting and supporting culture within the cityand provide a framework to support the city's organisations to integrate cultural considerations into their work.\nThis will be supported by practical materials that support government and non-government institutions working in the city to apply a cultural lens to their programs and projects. Examples of initiatives could include cultural awareness training modules, a calendar events, awards that recognise contributions to culture and awareness as well as guidance on incorporating cultural awareness into policy development.\nThe action takes inspiration from \u2018Health in All Policies' approaches applied in countries such as the United Kingdom, with the focus here instead on promoting local culture.\nIt is linked with Action 32, which focuses on howcultural awareness can be improved among school students.\nResilience Value\nThis action takes an integrated approach to building more cohesive and culturally aware city. It uses the notion of shared history and culture to build cohesion and resilience in the face of dislocation and constraints on freedom.\nDelivery lead\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022 Local partners\nACTION 32: Integrate cultural awareness into the educational curriculum\nThis action will see Ramallah Municipality partnerwith local schools to pilot greater integration of local cultural awareness into the formal curriculum. This will include excursions and a scheme where school students will playa hands-on role in managementand promotion of a specific heritage or cultural asset (e.g. helping to curate an exhibit at a museum). Outcomes will be monitored by a partner from the higher education sector.\nA private school has been chosen for the pilot as it has more autonomy to experiment with curriculum. If this pilot can demonstrate successful outcomes, in the longer term there is an opportunity forthis program to influence the broader national curriculum.\nResilience Value\nThe action provides opportunities for the young people to actively engage with Ramallah's cultural assets, helping to build a more cohesive Ramallites and Palestinian identity. It also unlocks additional resources to manage and promote the city's cultural assets to other citizens.\nDelivery lead\nPrivate school\nPartners\n\u2022\tRamallah Municipality\n\u2022\tAcademic institutions\n\u2022 NGOs\nPrivate sector investors\nACTION 33: Incorporate activities promoting good citizenship into extra-curricular programs for students\nSchool students in Ramallah and surrounding areas already undertake a range of extra-curricularactivities, such as excursions and volunteering. There is an opportunity to better integrate active learning opportunities around good citizenship into these activities.\nPartnering with NGOs working with youth, this action will develop targeted activities that aim to embed an understanding of key legal processes, rights and responsibilities within the daily lives of younger citizens. The action will build on the efforts of the existing City Youth Council, which to date has been limited to a small subset of young Ramallites.\nDelivery leads\nNGOs, schools\nPartners\n\u2022\tRamallah Municipality\n\u2022\tMinistry of Education and Higher Education\nResilience Value\nBuilding levels of civic awareness among the youth is extremely important for the future resilience of Ramallah, especially given the still fledgling nature of State of Palestine. This can create a future generation of leaders, as well as active participants in Ramallah and Palestinian society and the economy.\nCollaborating with Byblos - protecting and honoring cultural assets\nByblos in Lebanon is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, and as such it has a rich and complex history and mix of cultural assets. Much like Ramallah, Byblos identified in its resilience strategy that protection and celebration of culture can be an important catalyst for economic development, community engagement, participation and social cohesion.\nWe can learn a great deal from Byblos as we seek to document and celebrate culture and heritage in Ramallah. They are implementing a range of practical actions in this area, such as developing restoration guidelines for preserving and enhancing physical assets in their Old City, and empowering community members to practice traditional crafts and expand the market for artisanal products.\nOur two cities will collaborate regularly over coming years, sharing experiences and lessons learned.\n\nACTION 34: Establish fast and reliable telecommunications and IT infrastructure for Ramallah and its surroundings\nAchieving the objectives and delivering many of the actions will need to be supported byan efficient, fastand reliable communications network. While Palestine has recently been granted Israeli permission to establish 3G mobile coverage, we want to provide our residents with multiple communications options and ensure there is redundancy built into our systems.\nIn the first instance this action is about partnering with telecommunications providers to expand the current free city Wi-Fi network to reach more residents and businesses.\nIn parallel, this will involve installation of high-speed fibre in all areas of new development, along with rolling out the new3G network.\nResilience Value\nProvides more reliable communication, access to information, and efficient delivery of a range of services (e.g. health care, municipal services). This will support economic prosperity, engagement between community members, and effective communication in times of shock.\nRelated shocks and stresses\nRelated CRF drivers\n\u2022\tProvide reliable communication and mobility\n\u2022\tFoster economic prosperity\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tPrivate telecommunication companies\n\u2022\tMinistry of Telecommunicationsand IT\n\u2022\tPrivate sector investors\n115\nACTION 35: Increase IT capacity and training for schools\nRamallah Municipality will work with schools and educational institutes, as well as institutes such as House of Expertize, to provide IT infrastructure (e.g. in-room computers) and supporting training to more schools - particularly in disadvantaged areas. The aim is to enable Ramallah's students to be fully competent with IT and to be able to supportan emerging IT services industry sector.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022 Private sector investors\nResilience Value\n\u2022\tEducational institutions\n\u2022\tNGOs\nWill support the development of skills in young Ramallah residents, fostering better livelihoods and local economic development. The action will also build greater eguity through prioritising improvement of access to online resources and IT skills in vulnerable areas.\nACTION 36: Build on the Smart Ramallah project to enable greater access and public interaction with the city's assets\nThe Ramallah Smart City Project aims to enhance communication with the local community, improve remote service delivery, provide information to the public on activities and public events in the municipality, and gather feedback on service delivery. It also provides tools for remote data gathering.\nThis action will build on Ramallah Smart City to extend the types of assets and services included in the platform. It will include mapping and promotion of cultural assets, crowdsourced data gathering around usage patterns for public spaces, and a social platform where users can communicate experiences of the city's assets with one another.\nResilience Value\nThisaction can improve community engagement, awareness and accessibility of the city's assets. It can also enable innovative use of resources, including community-led action in a range of areas that support resilience.\nDelivery leads\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\nNGOs\nCultural organisations\nACTION 37: Use smart technologies to support critical infrastructure information sharing and integration\nA long-term aim for Ramallah is to take an integrated approach to critical infrastructure development that looks at the whole system, rather than individual utilities.\nWe are a long way from this at present, but will work towards an approach where needs for Transport, Energy, Telecommunications and other critical services are looked at holistically.\nThis is an initial step towards this future. It will establish a formal, trusted forum where critical infrastructure providers for Ramallah and its surroundings can come together to share information and collaborate around critical infrastructure interdependencies, vulnerabilities and opportunities for efficiencies (e.g. through co-locating infrastructure).\nThe action will draw on existing mapping work done as part of the Ramallah Smart City project, and establish clear information sharing protocols to ensure security of sensitive data. In this area there are opportunities to learn from other cities in the 100RC network, such as Rotterdam. If successful within Ramallah-AI-Bireh Governorate, the program could be rolled out on a National scale.\nResilience Value\nMore information sharing can help Ramallah make more of its limited resources, while also identifying system vulnerabilities, such as lack of redundancy or 'cascading conseguences', where a failure in one system has flow-on effects for others.\nDelivery lead\nRamallah Municipality\nPartners\n\u2022\tCurrent and future (e.g. JWU) utility providers\n\u2022\tMinistry of Telecommunication and IT\n\u2022\tMinistry of Public Works and Housing\n\u2022\tMinistry of Transport\nInspiration from Rotterdam - Cooperation between infrastructure providers\nThe Rotterdam Resilient City strategy identified that while Rotterdam municipality plays an important role in managing critical infrastructure, there are multiple network providers which operate independently of each other. They identified a need for greater organisation and cooperation, especially in times of emergency when a disruption to one type of critical infrastructure can have cascading impacts across infrastructure networks. In response, they are currently working to incorporate resilience into their regional infrastructure agenda, and to develop platforms where infrastructure and utility providers can safely share information for mutual benefit.\nImplementation\nNow we have developed the Resilient Ramallah Strategy, the real work can start! As noted in Action 13 in this Strategy, we will establish a specific unit within Ramallah Municipality to oversee implementation of Resilient Ramallah Strategy. This unitwill lead the following actions:\n\u2022\tDevelop detailed Implementation Plans for our 37 actions in cooperation with the municipal management team. This will be supported by an overarching Annual Plan.\n\u2022\tWorkto embed resilience principles and build capacity within Ramallah Municipality and other key institutions throughout ourcity-this isan important acknowledgement that truly enduring change for resilience will only come if it is embraced and owned throughout our city- notjust within one municipal unit.\n\u2022\tEnsure fruitful and effective ongoing relationships with 100RC, other cities in the network, and Ramallah's other \u2018twin cities'.\n\u2022\tMobilize additional resources and support for resiliencebuilding through national and international sources, including 100RC's Platform Partners.\n\u2022\tPromote leading activities that support the resilience of Ramallah and its surroundings.\n\u2022\tCoach different municipality departments and units in developing their annual plans in an integrated way\nThe table on page 122 summarizes all the actions documented in this strategy, including action leads, partner agenciesand delivery timeframes. It also documentsany alignment the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Targets established under the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\nAdditionally, the Action Implementation Summary includes two levels of implementation target - one indicates what we want to have achieved during Year 1, while the other provides the desired impact of each action once it has been implemented fully. These preliminary targets may be refined by developing the detailed Implementation Plan with long term, medium term and shortterm actions highlighted.\nMonitoring and reporting on our progress\nA crucial quality of resilient systems is reflectiveness -ensuring that we learn from past experiences and use them o inform future decisions. Resilient Ramallah will be a truly eflective strategy by monitoring our performance in a number of ways:\nWe will track progress againstthe implementation plans for each action, informed by the targets set out in the Action Implementation Summary. Acknowledging that cities rapidly evolve, in some cases we may identify that an action is not having the outcome we expected at the outset, or that the need for the action has changed. In these cases we will be adaptive, evolving actions where necessary in consultation with our local experts, partners and the Municipality.\nMonitor the collective progress of actions in this strategy to increase Ramallah's resilience. While data availability is a challenge, a longer term aim will be to report fully against a tested and recognized global framework for measuring urban resilience. In the interim, we will develop a concise and manageable set of city resilience indicators that suits the Ramallah context. These will be adapted from existing approaches, such as the City Resilience Framework,\nUN Sustainable Development Goals, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\nn keeping with Actions 13 and 15 of this Strategy, we will report to the public annually on progress against this Strategy. We see this as a positive example that can catalyse greater public accountability among other institutions in Palestine.","ENTITIES":{"ORGANIZATION":["House of Expertise and Cultural Palace","Economic

Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation alongside Durban, has put in place a framework to develop its urban resilience strategy. This framework came to life through the \u201cResilient Dakar\u201d program coordinated by my Chief Resilience Officer (CRO).\nAnchored around an inclusive approach and integrating a diversity\nof functions, the strategy drafting process has mobilized the city's\nstakeholders, sparking participation and developing\ndynamic actions aimed at articulating the various resilience\nobjectives. The strategy has also enabled an integrated approach\nto address the multiple risks and challenges that can affect a city.\nThanks to the support of the city's stakeholders, especially the members of the steering committee who I would like to thank for their contribution, the city of Dakar was able to develop an urban resilience strategy which, in addition to consolidating the diagnostic and identifying actions to be\ntaken, seeks to restore the territory's structural stability and to develop urban functions in the context of a city currently characterized by inadequately controlled urbanization.\nWith strategy development complete, additional efforts are required to initiate and achieve the actions\nidentified for sustainable urban management. The implementation of the resilience strategy sets the city into an exercise in both operational and prospective dimensions to enable the city to not only anticipate and resist shocks, risks, and constraints, but to act on the socio-economic dimension in order to improve the living conditions of its citizens.\nWe can realize these efforts thanks to our sheer will, the combined efforts of all public authorities, the\nenthusiastic participation of citizens, and with the support of our partners including 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, and its president Michael Berkowitz to whom I express my congratulations for putting forth such an unprecedented initiative. I would like to renew our sincere\ngratitude for the support of 100 Resilient Cities in developing the present urban resilience strategy.\nI would also like to reaffirm the interest of the city of Dakar in the 100 Resilient Cities network - the\nplatform for exchange of best practices among cities - and to express our availability to pursue further\npartnership, namely by receiving its technical assistance to ensure the successful implementation of the first urban resilience strategy in Africa.\nNOTE FROM THE\nCHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER\nI was motivated to become Dakar's Chief Resilience Officer\n(CRO) given the position's potential impact on the lives of\nDakarois. And upon notification of the city of Dakar's acceptance to the 100 Resilient Cities network, I accepted Mayor Sall's invitation to launch Dakar's resilience journey.\nIn my role as the CRO for Dakar, I have worked with a broad\ngroup of stakeholders to:\n01\tCreate a compelling vision of resilience within the city,\n02 Generate excitement and facilitate the resilience discussion across a diversity of sectors and actors, and\n03 Ensure active and inclusive public participation throughout the whole process.\nAssembling the pieces that form Dakar's present strategy has not always been an easy task. All those who took part in this exercise have been pushed to tackle and resolve various challenges and\nconcerns which we had, in order to effectively and efficiently\ncomplete our work. Through this process, the entire team\nacquired a valuable understanding that in order for Dakar's\nResilience Strategy to be successful, it had to acknowledge and\nbe built around the complex and interconnected challenges\nthat the city faces. This will position the city to best identify\ndownstream impact, and create appropriate solutions.\nI thank Mayor Sall for the opportunity to serve the City of Dakar\nthrough this process in my capacity as CRO. I am also thankful\nto Dalberg Global Development Advisors, and the staff and\nleadership of 100 Resilient Cities and Dakar's Resilience Steering Committee. Individually and collectively, these teams have made it possible to address Dakar's resilience challenges in a holistic\nand integrated way, leveraging innovation to address our city's\nemerging and chronic challenges of rapid urbanization.\nDakar's Resilience Strategy will prepare the city for a shared\nvision towards a stronger, more resilient city that is able to adapt to the demands of the 21st century and beyond. It will foster a shared confidence between all actors to better define problems, inform policies and utilize tools to prioritize, make informed\nchoices, and plan for the future.\nI am immensely excited about my contribution towards launching Dakar's Resilience Strategy and the work of my team. I very much look forward to carrying forward the implementation of the Strategy's many critical initiatives.\nMonsieur Antoine Faye Chief Resilience Officer - CRO\nLETTER FROM\n100 RESILIENT CITIES\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, it is my honor to congratulate the city of Dakar on the release of Africa's first resilience strategy. The work outlined within the strategy takes a bold approach toward confronting Dakar's current and future shocks and stresses. The strategy provides a roadmap towards a city that is clean, safe, energy efficient, and poised for inclusive growth. This reflects exactly the type of holistic urban resilience approach that 100RC seeks to spread far beyond our network of member cities.\nThe support and leadership of Dakar's Resilience Steering\nCommittee - spanning a diversity of representatives, from academia, public, and private sectors - was critical to the development of this document, and we thank them for their commitment to the strategy process. Of course, this strategy would not have been possible without the dedication of Dakar's Chief Resilience Officer, Mr. Antoine Faye, and the tireless efforts of his team.\nWhile the release of this strategy represents an important milestone in the pursuit of a more resilient Dakar, we know that our work is far from over. Building urban resilience is a multigenerational effort that will take continued commitment and action to ensure positive impact. We know that our success will not be measured by how well we plan for our future challenges, but rather how we implement the projects that will make the city as a whole stronger in the face of those challenges, no matter what form they may take.\nFor this reason, we are so excited to continue our partnership into the implementation phase, transforming the innovative projects presented within into reality. This body of work will positively impact the lives of all who reside in Dakar, both when disaster strikes and during times in-between.\nThese projects will also serve as a valuable best practice for the rest of the 100RC Network to learn from and emulate. As one of the African cities selected in the first round of the 100 Resilient Cities Challenge, Dakar has time and again been a pioneer in our global movement. We could not be more excited to continue to partner with Dakar as this city helps to spread the urban resilience revolution to cities across the region, and the world.\nCongratulations again on this important achievement, and we look forward to the shared journey ahead.\nYours Faithfully,\nMichael Berkowitz President, 100 Resilient Cities\nDAKAR: A CITY OF CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES\nDakar, Senegal's capital city, benefits from a strategic position as the western-most part of the African\ncontinent - it is at a junction point between Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Dakar is also an important metropolitan center for Senegal as well as the West African region as a whole.\nDakar is the 5th most populated city in West Africa, with a population estimated at 3.3 million in 2015.1 Sustained urban migration since the 1970s, along with a population growth rate of 2.6%2, contribute to the rapidly increasing population of Dakar. These trends have translated into a high urbanization rate of 4% on average between 2010 and 2015.3 At this pace, Dakar's population will double by 2025.\nDakar is facing many shocks and stresses that come with rapid urbanization, which are seriously outstripping its capacity to provide adequate services and quality living conditions to its citizens. Five areas have been identified as critical levers to reinforcing Dakar's resilience following a review process with the city's stakeholders. The perceptions gathered from these stakeholders and developed after a risk and asset analysis, were the basis of the selection process for the top five discovery areas. These discovery areas also have the potential to highly impact the city's social and economic resilience: (i) civic engagement, (ii) climate change readiness, (iii) sanitation, and (iv) energy efficiency. Urban mobility, which is as critical, will be addressed later due to capacity. Main challenges in each of these discovery areas are described below.\nCIVIC ENGAGEMENT\nThe recurrence and persistence of risks facing the city is strongly linked to the behavior and attitudes of its citizens. Weak civic engagement, inconsistent construction practices, poor waste disposal behaviors, misuse of roads, poor hygiene, and environmental degradation are all stresses caused by citizens' behaviors. The inability to control and correct such behaviors and attitudes can have massive repercussions or can become important shocks for the city (fires, epidemics, infrastructure disrepair, violence, etc.).\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nClimate change also presents a considerable challenge to the city. Rising sea levels are a threat to Dakar's coastlines and several other coastal West African countries. The resulting coastal erosion not only threatens the city's beaches which have an important touristic appeal, but also threatens to displace 12 of the city's 19 communes by the Atlantic sea front. Coastal erosion also affects infrastructure such as the harbor, and other industrial plants along the coast such as the Cap des Biches power plant which is located one meter below sea level and has suffered floods caused by strong seasonal swells. Climate change is represented as a cross-cutting challenge throughout the identified focus areas.\nThe city's waste water drainage infrastructure is constantly put to the test, especially in neighborhoods that were built on old shallows that have long been dried by years of drought. Furthermore, inconsistent construction standards have rendered the network of rainwater flow vulnerable. Waste disposal systems have also become obsolete - waste collection services reach only 39%4 of the population for solid waste, and between 10 to 30%5 for liquid waste. This waste is often disposed of in the open - in streams, the ocean, or dumps, without prior treatment.6 With the return of heavy rains, floods have been recurrent for the past few years, leaving citizens in vulnerable neighborhoods exposed to dangerous pathogens. In a region where diseases such as cholera and malaria are rampant, the amplitude of this public health hazard can have far reaching consequences.\nDakar also incurs the costs of limited supply of energy and frequent power. These lead to a loss of one percentage point in the city's GDP every year.7 Furthermore, Dakar consumes 56.9% of the national energy supply (about 1.3 TWh in 2013) and will need an additional supply of 50MW to meet its current demand.8 The majority of this electricity is produced by power stations built between the 1960s and 1980s, with a higher production cost (170 CFAF\/kWh) than its market value (118 CFAF\/kWh).9 Electricity production in Senegal is dependent on fossil fuels, which is one of the most expensive sources of energy and the likely driver of production costs. Thus, the final cost of energy to Senegalese consumers is one of the highest in West Africa.10 Moreover, the demand in electricity will rise two-fold between 2013 and 203011 due to inefficient consumer practices such as the use of incandescent lamps accounting for about 70% of Dakar's lighting, and consuming more than five times more electricity than a LED lamp, or the use of air conditioning without inverters which don't optimize for temperature changes.12\nThe public transport service is inadequate and is\ndeteriorating from year-to-year. It is difficult to move\nin Dakar by public or private transport, either because\nof the congestion encountered on the main roads,\nespecially in the central city area, or the poor quality\nof service. More than 100,000 vehicles enter and exit\nDakar every day on a congested, double-lane road13, as up to 80%14 of economic activities are concentrated in the capital city. Since 2000, conventional bus services are operated by Dakar Dem Dikk (DDD), but capacity provided by DDD is very low (few vehicles are operated daily), resulting in low and irregular frequencies. In\nresponse to the low capacity to meet public demand,\nsmaller buses, known as \u201ccars rapides\u201d, with between\n25 and 40 seats, arose with 2,500 to 4,000 buses\noperating in the city.15 The majority of cars rapides are\nconcentrated on the routes from the periphery to Dakar center. The quality of service is judged as bad by many users\/observers. In particular, the service provided\nby the cars rapides is usually characterized by old\nand polluting vehicles, bad maintenance, poor safety\nstandards, drivers stopping anywhere on the street to\npick up passengers, intimidation by controllers, the\npractice of cutting routes, obliging users to pay two or three times the fare for one trip, poor route information, long waiting times, and vehicles turning short of their\nstated destinations. The government plans to phase\nout these vehicles by 201816 and replace them with new buses that will improve safety, comfort, accessibility, while also being much more environmentally-friendly.\nConsequently, the development of a resilience\nstrategy aims to build the city of Dakar's capacity\nand preparedness to address these challenges. It is\nfurthermore evident that without the full participation\nof the city's inhabitants, even the most promising\nprojects will likely fail. In the resilience strategy, we will thus begin by implementing targeted awareness raising activities in order to solidify efforts to find the best\npossible solutions for the urban resilience of the city.\nWhile not an exhaustive approach to resolving each\nof Dakar's identified challenges, the current resilience\nstrategy provides details on prioritizing and addressing the challenges in a manner poised to yield near term resilience dividends.\nWe have the ambition to transform Dakar's current\nchallenges into opportunities. We envision to empower citizens advocating for the active engagement of their counterparts in the private and public spheres (local\nand national government) to make Dakar a city THAT IS CLEAN, SAFE, ENERGY EFFICIENT AND POISED FOR INCLUSIVE GROWTH to sustain any future shocks or stresses.\nVISION:\nA RESILIENT DAKAR\nPROMOTE AN INCLUSIVE RESILIENCE AGENDA BY\nAND FOR DAKAR CITIZENS\nWe will put those who live in Dakar firmly at the heart of the resilience strategy in laying the foundations for active and sustainable citizen participation\nPROVIDE A HEALTHY LIVING ENVIRONMENT TO\nDAKAR'S CITIZENS\nWe will make Dakar a pleasant city to live in by building more green spaces and ensuring a better system for citizens and professionals to manage waste\nPOSITION THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS A RESILIENCE PARTNER\nWe will foster and support the involvement of the private sector -both formal and informal - in building resilience\nLEVERAGE ENERGY EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT THE CITY'S RESILIENCE\nWe will leverage the wasted potential of energy saving technologies to solve long-standing unresolved electricity challenges\nPROMOTE INCLUSIVE AND\nEFFICIENT GOVERNANCE\nWe will put in place collaborative platforms that encourage all stakeholders to take part in initiatives which support resilience\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOF THE DAKAR RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nDEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF THE RESILIENCE STRATEGY FOR DAKAR\nThe drafting process of Dakar's resilience strategy has sparked a lasting collaboration between several stakeholder groups, particularly experts and decision makers from all levels of the public, private, and civil society spheres.\nIn celebrating the choice of Dakar as part of the 100 Resilient Cities network, the workshop to launch the strategy development process also served to anchor the framework and pillars for the development of a comprehensive resilience strategy for Dakar. More specifically, the workshop also accomplished the following:\n\u2022\ta broad common understanding of the justification for the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, its mission and services in support to members;\n\u2022\ta definition of resilience agreed upon by all stakeholders;\n\u2022\tacceptance of the key concepts, definitions and institutional framework for resilience, as anchors to the approach and thinking to develop the resilience strategy for Dakar.\nOver 50 stakeholders and stakeholder groups were consulted during the Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA) phase. Interviews were conducted with each of them to: (i) present the initiative concept; (ii) understand their vision for the city's resilience and the project; and (iii) identify the most critical shocks and stresses that the city may face. These interviews have also allowed us to: (iv) identify similar initiatives implemented or being planned; (v) identify the main stakes this strategy would have to consider; and (vi) gauge the stakeholders' interest in participating in the drafting of the strategy within the thematic groups. This in anticipation of the lasting platform we will put in place to reach concrete results and ensure the successful is delivery of the resilience strategy of the city.\nThe interviews with the different stakeholders enabled a refinement of the strategy through an iterative process of generating new ideas and a prioritization of existing ideas. Following this, we formed a group for each priority theme of the strategy. Each group was formed to promote diversity of backgrounds and maximize the quality of ideas generated. We then organized a workshop bringing together the CRO, citizens of Dakar, subject matter experts, and municipality professionals to share the main insights from detailed analyses of the different identified themes. This brought out the main strategic objectives and secondary objectives that were identified for the city.\nAn awareness workshop on the drafting of the resilience strategy was conducted at the same time with the different services of the municipality, other internal stakeholders in the city, as well as representatives from all 19 communes. This workshop was delivered with the large group first and then in smaller groups. The 100 Resilient Cities process was presented to participants who then engaged in conversations around the key themes of urban resilience.\nThis participatory design process for the resilience strategy also helped identify a number of other initiatives. The ones that were shortlisted will allow stakeholders to better address the numerous shocks and stresses that Dakar faces to date or will likely face in the near future.\nPrimary and secondary objectives, as well as initiatives\naddress the identified shocks and stresses at this stage. The selected 21 initiatives fleshed out in this strategy document have been built on top of existing projects and will strengthen the critical components of economic, social, environmental, and strategic resilience. The\nmunicipality of Dakar will play a catalyst role in kicking\noff and coordinating each of them. We will leverage the approach of putting stakeholders who care about the future of the city in conversation with each other. We will also strive to be surrounded with the best partners\nfor the implementation of this strategy. Each of the\ninitiatives will be implemented by capitalizing on the\n100 Resilient Cities broad network (similar initiatives,\nexperience sharing, etc.), and by profiting from a\nplatform of partners engaged in the strengthening of\nDakar's resilience.\nOur resilience strategy is not a fixed document. In a spirit of constant improvement, the document will be reviewed periodically to account for economic, political, social,\nand environmental changes that the city will experience.\n1.1.\tPRESENTATION OF SENEGAL\nSenegal is a Sahelian country with two seasons: a\ndry season from November to May, and a wet season\nfrom June to October. Senegal is on a plateau with an\naltitude that is below 130 meters (with the exception of the South-East which can reach altitudes of over 580 meters). The country's geographic location and natural resources give rise to a diversity of ecosystems that constitute an important environmental asset. However, this natural capital is threatened by drought, soil and vegetation degradation, dire loss of biodiversity, as well as coastal erosion.\nSenegal is one of Africa's most politically stable\ncountries. The country has considerably strengthened its democratic institutions since its independence in 1960. Senegal is a secular and democratic republic. It strives to ensure equality for all its citizens under the rule of law, regardless of their origins, race, gender, or religion. It\nacknowledges and respects all faiths.\nSenegal aspires to emerge out of poverty by 2035. The\nEmerging Senegal Plan (Plan Senegal Emergent - PSE) is an ambitious strategy devised by the government of Senegal to foster economic growth with a high impact on human development. Senegal's government is determined to consolidate its achievements, especially in terms of democratic governance, and to reprioritize economic, political, and social stability. The success of this plan is rooted in generating investments for profitable sectors of the economy such as agriculture, tourism, housing, social economy, mines, logistics, and industry to catalyze high and stable growth. One of the PSE's projects is to make Dakar a West African regional hub for companies and international institutions, for health and education services and tourism. To achieve these objectives and become a city of the 21st century, Dakar needs to develop strategies to increase its capacity to better respond and adapt to the burgeoning economic, social, and physical stresses.\nDakar is the western-most location in Senegal and Africa. It was established by Governor Protet in 1857. Dakar (or Ndakarou in the Wolof language) is close to 170 years old and 79 km2 wide (0.04% of the national territory)17, on what was coined as the Cape Verde peninsula during colonial times. It shares its eastern border with the Thies region, and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean otherwise. The city of Dakar is one of the four departments that make up the region of Dakar: Guediawaye, Pikine, and Rufisque are the other three. Its population was estimated at 1.2 million as of 2015.18\nThe city of Dakar has 19 communes: Biscuiterie, Camberene, Dakar Plateau, Dieuppeul - Derkle - Castor, Fann - Point E - Amitie, Goree, Grand-Dakar, Grand Yoff,\nDAKAR, A CITY WITH A CHANGING POLITICAL AND GOVERNANCE LANDSCAPE\nGueule Tapee - Fass - Colobane, HLM, Hann - Bel Air, Mermoz - Sacre Creur, Medina, Ngor, Ouakam, Parcelles Assainies, Patte d'Oie, Sicap Liberte and Yoff.\nWithin the framework of Decentralization Act III enacted on December 28th, 2013 (Loi n\u00b0 2013-10), each of the 19 communes composing the city of Dakar has become autonomous and is governed by an elected mayor. Thus, the city of Dakar has been reduced to an administrative district. Coordination between the 19 communes and the department has become challenging. Another challenge is the lack of effective cooperation and dialogue between the central government and the municipalities, which hampers the city's ability to provide quality public services to its citizens.\nDAKAR, A CITY OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES ---------------------------------------------------------------------\nDakar is home to 50% of Senegal's urban population, 95% of industrial and commercial plants, 80% of the country's infrastructure and services, and 87% of formal jobs.19 Despite several attempts to decentralize development opportunities, this situation persists. People from rural areas and other cities in Senegal are attracted to Dakar because of its strategic position, economic activity (68% of the country's GDP is generated in the city), and health and education infrastructure. Seventy-five percent of domestic movements of goods are originating in or routed to Dakar. The main driver of growth is the tertiary sector, which is mainly concentrated in the capital, particularly in Dakar-Plateau.\nThe Leopold Sedar Senghor international airport is\nserved by most major airlines with direct flights to the capitals of the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Middle East as well as to the rest of Africa. The largest port in the country, Port Autonome de Dakar (PAD), serves as a national entry point for imports and exports. The PAD also plays a key role in regional integration: for instance, 70% of imports by Mali from overseas transit through the PAD.20\nDAKAR, A CITY OF CULTURE\nFrom its independence, Senegal has positioned itself as a beacon of African cultural and artistic diversity as spearheaded by its first head of state, Late Leopold Sedar Senghor. As a result, Dakar has been the host of the first and third World Festival of Black Arts (FESMAN) in 1966 and 2010. The Festival celebrates African and diaspora talent under the theme of African renaissance, and claims to be the largest gathering of black arts and cultures. It is both an intellectual and festive event. In 2016, Dakar hosted the 12th edition of the Dak'Art Biennale, one of the most prominent visual arts exhibitions in Africa, held in Dakar every two years. Official exhibits and \u2018off' exhibits bring a few hundred artists from Africa and the world.\nDakar is also a cultural and intellectual hub as it is home to the Cheikh Anta Diop University and several regional educational institutions. In addition to being a member\nof the Organization of World Heritage cities with Goree Island (world heritage site since 1978), Dakar is also one of the three creative African cities in the UNESCO creative cities network since 2014.\nUNESCO Director Irina Bokova declared during the Istanbul Conference on the Alliance of Civilizations in 2011 that \u201cculture is a source of resilience\u201d. Culture is indeed not limited to dancing and music, it is a source of wisdom and inspiration, two traits that strengthen bonds between members of a community and helps them build resilience in times of catastrophes.\nCONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES OF 100 RESILIENT CITIES\n2.1.\tCONTEXT OF 100\nRESILIENT CITIES\nDeveloping cities are young, dynamic, ambitious, and breeding grounds for innovation. However, they are often burdened by fast and erratic growth. In 2050, about two thirds of the world's population will be living in cities. Therefore, to face this global challenge and to celebrate its 100 years of operations, the Rockefeller Foundation decided in 2013 to address three major forces:\nUrbanization. By 2050, three-fourths of the world's population will live in cities, putting new strains on limited resources.\nGlobalization. Cities are more interconnected\nthan ever before - and a system failure in one city can cause collapse in economies across the globe.\nClimate Change. For the many cities located in fragile ecosystems and along coasts, the impacts of climate change can be particularly catastrophic.\nUrban resilience is generally understood to be the ability for individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and urban systems to survive, adapt, and develop despite the number of acute shocks and stresses they may face. Strengthening resilience in cities is now imperative, seeing the growth in the number and size of cities\naround the world. Given their importance in terms of economic growth, innovation, individual growth, social and cultural exchanges, cities ought to be treated with meticulous attention. The Foundation created an organization called 100 Resilient Cities, and has thus set for itself the objective to support 100 cities around the world in their efforts to strengthen their resilience strategy and operations.\n100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation thus looks forward to strengthening the operational capacity of 100 cities around the world, so they can fully attain their potential by preparing themselves against the shocks and stresses that come with urbanization, rapid population growth, urban mobility, climate change, etc. The first step of this process is the elaboration of resilience strategies specific to each city. Dakar and Durban are the first two African cities that have been selected in the first cohort of 100 Resilient Cities (100RC).\n2.2.\tALIGNMENT OF THE RESILIENCE STRATEGY WITH THE EXISTING URBAN PLANNING STRATEGIES FOR THE CITY OF DAKAR\nIn 2011, the municipality of Dakar engaged in a strategic planning exercise and called on its socio-economic partners in order to achieve their common objectives considering the social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the city. The resulting Strategic Orientation Document (Document d'Orientation Strategique - DOS) is a city planning document that clarifies the vision, values, engagements, roles, and responsibilities of the city council of Dakar. The document also suggests means to achieve results in the medium term (2012-2017) and long term (by 2030).\nThe municipality expressed the following vision: \u201cDakar is a driver of socio-economic and cultural performance, striving for good governance and sustainable growth, for the prosperity of its people.\u201d This vision will be achieved through the following strategic areas:\nDakar, a city with planned development;\nDakar, a beautiful city with an improved living environment;\nDakar, a city focused on education, health, wellness, and creativity through culture;\nDakar, a city aspiring to socio-economic development\nSimilarly, the Environment Action Plan (PACTE), aligned with the Agenda 21 and the DOS, is another key feature of the Cultural and Economic Development Plan (Plan de Developpement Economique et Culturel - PDEC) focused on Dakar's social and environmental responsibility.\nThese planning documents are the plinth of the city's resilience strategy that takes into account themes in the vision for the city and strategic intervention areas, while adding key elements of resilience. The resilience strategy has the ambition to become a reference document that all local and international partners could refer to, in order to provide their support in the implementation of actions to strengthen the city's resilience.\nSTRATEGIC AND SPECIFIC RESILIENCE\nOBJECTIVES FOR DAKAR\n3.1. CONTEXT AND IDENTIFICATION PROCESS OF RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES FOR DAKAR\nThe first phase of the initiative consisted of a preliminary diagnostic of the city's current resilience situation by ranking its available resources, potential threats, constraints, risks it is exposed to, as well as stakeholders' perception of its resilience. This diagnostic phase resulted in a non-refuted conclusion: on all measures set\nforth by the components of the Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA) - a tool proposed by 100RC - Dakar is not perceived as a resilient city. The only area in which the city showed some strengths was \u201cstability and security\u201d, as illustrated by the stakeholders' perception tool below.\nThe city thus faces several stresses of which 23 were\nidentified during the preliminary diagnostic. They are illustrated here above. Some the most urgent stresses identified include:\n\u2022\tUnemployment, and more specifically the low diversity of employment opportunities for youth\n\u2022\tFrequent power outages and poor access to technology (low bandwidth, etc.)\n\u2022\tEnvironmental degradation (pollution caused by lack of access to water and sanitation services) and the effects of climate change (coastal erosion, rise of sea levels, etc.)\nWeak community and civic engagement, and chronic mendacity\nThis process resulted in the identification of six main intervention areas (illustrated below). Climate change has been added in addition to these intervention areas as a cross cutting intervention, affecting all the others.\nCIVIC ENGAGEMENT\nHow can Dakar citizens' civic engagement be promoted? Particularly in the interest of developing responsible practices when it comes to hygiene, security, and solidarity?\nURBANIZATION\nHow can responsibilities be shared efficiently in urban planning? How should the urban plans be formulated along with the transportation plans while ensuring their implementation?\nWATER AND SANITATION\nHow can waste water and rain water be appropriately processed, and how can clean water be distributed efficiently?\nENERGY\nWhich strategies can allow the supply of enough energy of good quality for the city, while optimizing for its costs and externalities?\nHEALTH\nHow can the use of health infrastructure be maximized in order for the people of Dakar to benefit from reliable health services?\nDIGITAL ECONOMY\nHow can quality digital services be disseminated to the city's inhabitants, as well as contribute to its growth?\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nHow can the intervention areas mentioned above contribute to the lessening of climate change effects in the city?\nFive discovery areas have been shortlisted as critical levers to reinforcing Dakar's resilience following a review process with the city's stakeholders. The perceptions gathered from these stakeholders and the risks and assets analysis were the basis of the selection process for the top five discovery areas with high impact potential on the city's social and economic resilience:\n(i) civic engagement, (ii) climate change readiness, (iii) sanitation and, (iv) energy efficiency. Urban mobility, which is as critical, will be addressed later due to capacity.\nThe second phase of the initiative consisted of developing a resilience strategy for the city focused on the priority intervention areas identified during the preliminary resilience diagnostic. The development of the resilience strategy thus resulted from an in-depth study of the shortlisted priority intervention areas in order to identify a large portfolio of high impact activities that address the city's challenges.\nUrban mobility, civic engagement and climate change were not included in the detailed analyses of the focus areas, in the context of the resilience strategy. However, the various existing studies on these topics over the years, were leveraged. Sanitation and energy efficiency reports are accessible.\nSince it has joined 100RC, Dakar, primarily through its Chief Resilience Officer has hosted several awareness and knowledge sharing campaigns with stakeholders in government, civil society, and the private sector, as illustrated below. This process was reinforced through a workshop to validate findings and intervention opportunities, as well as to formulate the city's vision for resilience and set the objectives to achieve it. Important stakeholders who took part in the workshop include the municipality, government representatives from key sectors (Waste management coordination unit -UCG), private sector actors (Federation of Electricity Enterprises in Senegal - FESELEC), and research institutions (African Institute for Urban Management -IAGU).\na.\tPromote an inclusive resilience agenda by and for Dakar citizens\nThe recurrence and persistence of risks facing the city is strongly linked to the behaviors and attitudes of its citizens. Weak civic engagement, inconsistent construction practices, poor waste disposal behaviors, anarchic occupation of roads, unhealthy lifestyles, and environmental degradation are all stresses caused by citizens' behaviors. The inability to control and correct such behaviors and attitudes can have massive repercussions or can become important shocks for the city (fires, epidemics, infrastructure collapse, civil violence, etc.). A shared understanding and buy in from the population, as well as an inclusive approach will be building blocks to the generalization of resilience practices.\nAwareness of the link between on one hand, natural and urban environments, and on the other, social and economic development, is essential on the journey to resilience. In this context, Dakar's resilience strategy should be a repository of multiple interventions by all its citizens.\nCivic disengagement is at best a lack of understanding or failure to carry out one's civic duty, or at worse indifference about the city's affairs. This can be the result of a lack of investment in dialogue or social solidarity efforts, and the absence of a culture of shared responsibility about city preservation. Civic education is thus a crucial factor for the harmonious development of a city. In fact, citizens who understand and respect\ncommon laws: are able to discipline themselves and adopt responsible behaviors towards their community; are knowledgeable of human and civic rights; and understand the importance of upholding the values of peace, solidarity, and environmental friendliness. These abilities are key assets to promoting harmony within their communities.\nCitizens should be at the heart of the resilience strategy to bring out the strong link between human actions and their effects on the challenges the strategy seeks to solve. To do so, it will for instance be necessary to innovate methods of knowledge sharing, education, and city-wide communication channels to improve citizens' comprehension of the problems they face and promote the concept of resilience as a tool to solve those problems sustainably. In addition to this, awareness campaigns will be conducted with religious leaders, traditional chiefs, and influential figures who play a thought leadership role in their community, whose voices are heard and respected.\nb.\tCreate a healthy living environment for Dakar's citizens\nFor citizens to be proud of their city, they need to feel that they are living in a safe and harmonious environment which can allow them to improve their living conditions. Dakar has witnessed the destruction of several of its green spaces, but also the lack of planning for housing, as well as rising pollution levels.24 Dakar produces more than 850 tons of waste daily, but more than 400,000 (38.5%)25 of its inhabitants do not have access to basic sanitation services. This leads to a proliferation of illegal dump sites all around the city. In addition, 30% of the population doesn't have access to sewage services; some call on manual emptiers who dispose of their liquid waste into the surroundings. Lastly, green spaces from the time of independence, which served as parks and could have contributed to the preservation of the environment, have increasingly been disappearing due to rapid urbanization and\nirregular construction all over the city. These elements all contribute to the degradation of the city's environmental landscape.\nImproving the living environment of its residents should be one of the essential services that the municipality offers. This would range from improving organization of sanitation services to raising awareness about activities that can be detrimental to the environment. The municipality of Dakar has expressed a strong interest in improving the living conditions through the launch of programs such as the Environmental Action Plan (Plan d'actions environnementales - P.ACT.E) - City of Dakar, and the program clean city \u201cDakar Set Wecc\u201d. These initiatives should be strengthened in the framework of the resilience strategy.\n\u201c Green spaces must be multiplied across the city in order to improve the living environment, with the very few unoccupied spaces that remain.\u201d - Neighborhood council official\nc.\tPosition the private sector as a resilience partner\nThe lack of economic prosperity is another area of intervention identified for the city, based on the perceptions of the population. This perception is further confirmed by stresses identified in the preliminary risk assessments such as unemployment, lack of diversified employment opportunities, limited access to credit, causes or effects of low productivity of the private sector, and to an extent, lack of economic prosperity. The private sector has an important role to play in the resilience strategy of the city, not only by investing and forming partnerships for the delivery of the resilience initiatives, but also through the creation of employment opportunities for social stability. However, the private sector is not sufficiently empowered or associated to fully play its role, as expressed in the preliminary assessment.\nBesides, the Senegalese economy rests predominantly on the informal sector which contributes 42% to the wealth of the country, and employs more than 48.8% of the working population.26 The informal economy has thus been the main driver of the construction of the city and urban life. For instance, the company Dakar Dem Dikk (DDD), an urban transportation company, cannot fulfill the demand for all neighborhoods.\nUntil recently, its 280 buses only covered 25% of the demand in transport.27 The gaps of Dakar Dem Dikk\ngave rise to an informal transportation sector. The \u201ccars rapides\u201d (refurbished buses), yellow-and-black taxis, and \u201cclandos\u201d (\u2018clandestine' taxis) transport more than 875,000 passengers daily, and have become the common modes of transportation.28 Similarly, in the sanitation sector, 38.5%29 of households in Dakar use the services of informal waste collectors (horse cart owners and manual pit emptiers). The intervention of these informal players is thus essential to the city's functioning, but can equally contribute to the city's environmental pollution (illegal dump sites across the city), or create urban congestion, etc.\nThe municipality will thus have to give an important role to the private sector in acting as a resilience partner by promoting a climate favorable to investments and economic activity, by engaging and coordinating the informal sector, and by promoting local products and services as means to generate local wealth and employment.\nd.\tCreate a healthy living environment for Dakar's citizens\nDakar incurs the costs of limited supply of energy and frequent power outages - 11.8 power outages occur every month on average. These lead to a loss of one percentage point in the city's GDP every year.30 Furthermore, Dakar consumes 56.9% of the national energy supply (about 1.3 TWh in 2013) and will need an additional supply of 50MW to meet its current demand.31\nWith an average annual growth rate of 4.4%,32, 33, the electricity consumption of Dakar is expected to double between 2013 and 2030.34 At the same time, Senegal has committed to reduce its emissions of CO2 from the energy sector by 17% by 2030. Focusing only on developing electricity supply has shown its limits given the amount of investments required, against limited public resources and competing priorities in education, health and basic infrastructure.\nWhile it is important to note that electricity is managed at the central government level and thus not in the capacity of the city, local authorities have a crucial role to support government efforts to ensure that the energy needs of all citizens are met. However, ensuring energy sufficiency is complex and requires interventions across various areas including policy and regulation, technology, and behavior change. Encouraging the adoption of energy efficient technologies among citizens is a simple and cost-effective way local authorities can engage to reduce energy wastage.\ne.\tPromote inclusive and efficient governance\nGovernance institutions that are actively engaged and collaborate closely are essential to implement the resilience strategy, especially in the context of cities with a special status such as Dakar where the central government and municipality work in the same territory and share responsibilities on several aspects. For instance, sanitation, which was managed for a long time by the municipality, has now become the responsibility of a government institution, as well as the collection and allocation of taxes to finance the sector which is exclusively managed at the central government level. The procurement of housing permits or electricity licenses is equally controlled by the central government. Despite the decentralization act, Dakar is in a context where the central government and municipal authorities operate within the same jurisdiction with the common mandate to provide basic necessities and a safe living environment to residents. However, there are several overlaps between these two powers, which often hinder the progress of activities and initiatives to develop the city. Dakar has now became a stage for political stakes and negotiations between the central power and the municipality. This state of affairs negatively impacts the speed and transparency of procedures. An important cautionary step in the design of the resilience strategy was to acquire a clear comprehension of these relationships.\nTo overcome the city's vulnerability and put in place an efficient resilience strategy, collaboration between the central power and municipality is paramount. This can go a long way in ensuring a shared understanding of the concept of resilience and its initiatives for the city, as well as the provision of quality services to citizens. The collective action spearheaded by the city's Mayor, technical advisors in the public sector, and the central government will be necessary to carry out the resilience strategy of Dakar. Citizens should benefit from institutions that work better than they do now, and that are capable of consistently providing services of better quality. Besides, the implementation of an inclusive and efficient governance strategy will contribute to a positive relationship between institutions and the citizens so as to provide them with a clean and safe living environment.\nENVISIONING THE CITY OF DAKAR:\nA RESILIENT SYSTEM\nCities are systems; consisting of multiple composite\nparts, contributors and subsystems. Improving the\nindividual systems that make up a city will increase the resilience of the city overall. Resilient systems\nwithstand, respond to, and adapt more readily to shocks\nand stresses to emerge stronger after tough times, and last better in good times. We view the strategic\nobjectives and the associated initiatives outlined in this document as essential contributors to strengthening the city of Dakar's resilience. In developing each initiative, the following resilience qualities were taken into consideration, as these aid in enhancing each initiative as well as contributing to the overall resilience of the city.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tEnsure comprehension of the concept of resilience by all citizens of Dakar\n\u2022\tSpark the citizens' interest in, and contribution to resilience through active citizenship\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION: Comprehension of resilience and active citizenship is weak among Dakar citizens. Civic acts such as crossing roads using pedestrian crossings or disposing of trash in bins are simple gestures that the city's citizens don't often perform. Public property is often stolen (e.g. electric posts, rails) or destroyed (e.g. during riots against public authorities). Some citizens are convinced that citizenship is the State's responsibility as some colloquial expression suggests: \u201cmbedd mi, mdeddou bour leu\u201d (literal translation: streets belongs to the State; meaning, we are allowed to do whatever we want in the streets since the State is in charge of fixing it). To change such attitudes, this initiative aims to spread the concept of resilience and foster active citizenship among Dakar citizens. This will propel the rise to:\n\u2022\tAutonomous citizens, who understand and respect the law, are capable of self-regulation, and adopt responsible behaviors for themselves and for those around them;\n\u2022\tCitizens capable of engaging in conversations about the city's affairs, debating with discernment, and taking initiative;\n\u2022\tCitizens who are conscious about the resilience challenges facing their country and communities, in order to develop a sense of belonging and choose to adopt more responsible behaviors, as well as citizens who transmit this awareness to those around them.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative will spark the rise of new types of citizens who are conscious of their civic duty in the city's prosperity and who embrace resilience-promoting behaviors. It will also empower communities to have increased civic engagement, and will generate strong traction around the implementation of the resilience strategy.\nINTERVENTION AREA\nCivic engagement\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nMinistry of urban renewal, housing, and living environment (MRHC); youth associations; women's associations; religious guides; Ministry of Youth and Sports.\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nMedium term\nPROJECT TYPE:\nNew\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nDonors (Not yet identified)\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tElicit a feeling of inclusion of citizens in the core of the city's actions, and incorporate their feedback in implementation of various initiatives\n\u2022\tEnsure citizen's ownership and buy-in towards the resilience strategy\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nCitizens are both actors in and beneficiaries of efforts that strengthen the city's resilience against the risks it faces. As such, they need to be and feel at the core of resilience initiatives, and therefore necessitating awareness and expression of their perception of resilience within their communities. The intervention aims to address this need and to spark citizens' involvement and ownership of Dakar's resilience strategy.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative will promote a common understanding and shared perspectives in the Dakar community of the city's resilience, as well as encourage citizens to act towards strengthening the city's resilience.\nINTERVENTION AREA\nCivic engagement\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nOrange\/Sonatel, Tigo, Expresso, Dakarlives\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nMedium term\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nelecom companies; Donors (Not yet identified)\nPROJECT TYPE:\nNew\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tEnsure an understanding and ownership of the concept of resilience by Dakar citizens from an early age in order to generate spontaneous behaviors strengthening resilience\n\u2022\tAnchor civic values in the basic education of all Dakar citizens\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nFormal education includes aspects of civic and moral education, but needs to be strengthened so that people understand at an early age (during elementary school) the concept of resilience. On the other hand, with a net school attendance rate of 61% (UNICEF, 2015), a significant proportion of Senegalese children of school age do not get enrolled in formal primary education. Some are enrolled in Koranic schools \u00abDaaras\u00bb where they receive religious education. Education on resilience and active citizenship should be extended to all educational institutions. These modules would be delivered through all channels including education in public schools, private schools, as well as Koranic schools. Thus all children, regardless of the educational system in which they find themselves, will have the basic knowledge to be active actors of resilience and active citizens.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative strengthens the commitment and collaboration among industry players for better accountability in educating marginalized populations. It promotes the emergence of communities sharing the concept of resilience. It also contributes to the empowerment of people by anchoring the concept of resilience at an early age, regardless of the form of education received.\nINTERVENTION AREA: PRIMARY PARTNERS:\nCivic engagement\tMinistry of National Education; other 100RC cities with\nsimilar initiatives (Melbourne), Koranic schools, parent-teacher associations\nACTION LEAD:\tIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nMunicipality of Dakar\tMedium term\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nCentral Government; Donors (Not yet identified)\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tBe informed of the shocks to which the city could be exposed in real time\n\u2022\tPrepare the city and its population to prevent and respond effectively in case of a major shock's occurrence through an effective response and communication system\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION: In 2013, Dakar experienced floods that caused a loss of life and injuries to populations, and infrastructure to collapse. Citizens were not prepared for such events, given the lack of anticipation and communication about its potential impact. For example, a few months before the rainy season or time of high tides, the municipality could start communicating on disturbances observed to anticipate and reduce eventual damages caused by flooding or other major hazards. National and international observatories keep track of natural events preceding major shocks, but such information is not actively used to the best advantage of the city. This situation raises the need for the city (population and ecosystem stakeholders) to be prepared to respond in a timely way, in the event that such shocks occur, through an effective response and communication system.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nProvides a reliable database on the state of vulnerability of the city. Builds a resilient city, informed of its key challenges, through early detection of and warning about imminent shocks. Ensures the protection of populations, and helps prevent shocks that can be anticipated such as floods, tornadoes, seismic movements, etc.\nINTERVENTION AREA:\tPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nCross-cutting\tNational Agency of the Civil Aviation and Meteorology\n(ANACIM), other international partners to be identified\nACTION LEAD:\tIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nMunicipality of Dakar\tContinuous\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nMunicipality; Donors (Not yet identified)\nPROJECT TYPE:\nNew\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tConservation of biodiversity\n\u2022\tPreservation of green spaces for leisure and relaxation\n\u2022\tEnforcement of land use policy\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nSince the independence era, the green areas of Dakar have considerably decreased. The Hann National Park remains the only green place left in the city. Rehabilitating green spaces across the city thus represents a means to fight against climate change. The initiative will consist of collaborating with the private sector to develop public gardens and playgrounds in different areas of the city - neighborhoods, empty spaces between motorways, along main roads of the city, etc.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative will create a greener, well-kept, and people friendly city. It will also ensure an inclusive management of resilience initiatives through effective framework for partnership between the public sector and the private sector.\nINTERVENTION AREA: PRIMARY PARTNERS:\nClimate change\tLarge Private Companies; National Patronage Council\n(CNP); other cities in the 100RC network with experience in similar initiatives (e.g. Melbourne, Boulder)\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nPrivate sector\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nContinuous\nINITIATIVE TYPE:\nNew\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nInitiative B.1.2.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tCreate a healthy living environment for the residents of Dakar\n\u2022\tEnsure active contributions by all stakeholders towards protecting the environment\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nPollution and environmental degradation are both stresses identified in the city during the preliminary resilience assessment. The region of Dakar produces about 15,786 million tons of CO2 annually, mainly from industrial activities and energy production, transportation of people, and household activities.35 The current initiative aims to ensure resilience building by all stakeholders, using the private sector as a driver of change. It will encourage the adoption of \u00abgreen\u00bb behaviors for environmental protection (e.g. reduced waste generation; reforestation of public spaces; use of less polluting vehicles, etc.) through a taxation incentive scheme. Companies complying with the defined standards will enjoy benefits such as tax reduction, and on the flipside, those not complying will incur tax penalties. The municipality will explore ways to collaborate with the private sector to create a healthy living environment for people.\n\u00ae \u00a9\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative encourages users to respect and protect the environment in their daily activities. Moreover, it will reduce pollution in the city to further prevent climate change related damages through coordinated action of all stakeholders.\n* *\nINTERVENTION AREA:\nClimate change\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nINITIATIVE TYPE:\nNew\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nCommerce ministry, Informal sector, Ministry of consumer goods, local products promotion, and small and medium enterprises (MCSICPPLPME); National council of Patronage\n(CNP)\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nContinuous\n*\nSOURCES OF FUNDING :\nPrivate sector; Climate change financing mechanisms\n35 Technical report, PCTI Dakar Region, 2013\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nInitiative B.2.1.\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tEncourage Dakar citizens to adopt systemic sorting of waste before disposal\n\u2022\tEducate Dakar citizens on better sanitation management\n\u2022\tProvide a healthy living environment for Dakar citizens\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nAlmost all of the 850 tons of solid waste38 generated in Dakar every day are sent to the Mbeubeuss landfill where they do not undergo further processing, other than the informal circular economy on site,39 and pose a risk to the environment. In order to limit the consequences of the city's poor waste management, households have to get accustomed to sorting their trash in specific bins. The sorted waste can then be recycled and this provides a way to reduce waste and create economic opportunities through recycling.40\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative ensures the provision of basic sanitation services. It will also reduce the amount of waste normally sent to landfills, and provide economic opportunities through waste recycling for the private sector. The initiative has the power to spark a gradual change of population habits in sorting waste both in public places and also in homes. This intervention can lastly engage communities to be more responsible in the management of waste.\nINTERVENTION AREA:\nSanitation\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nCity councils; UCG; district councils\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nContinuous\nINITIATIVE TYPE:\nBuilding on existing initiative\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nMunicipality \/ Donors (Not yet identified)\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nInitiative B.2.2.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tReduce the proliferation of illegal dumps in the city\n\u2022\tCoordinate with horse cart owners to structure their intervention into the value chain\n\u2022\tEmpower residents to manage household waste\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nThe landscape of Dakar is characterized partly by heaps of rubbish and plastic bags disposed\nhaphazardly throughout the city. More than 400,000 people (38.5% of the population of the city of Dakar) that are not covered by collective sanitation services, are served mainly by horse cart owners who are informal collectors of solid waste.41 These horse cart owners unload the collected trash in nature, creating dumps which become ecological ticking time bombs (there are 40 in the city currently).42 Trash collection and treatment in Dakar is largely managed by the national waste management agency (Unite de Coordination et de Gestion des dechets - UCG), which provides neighborhoods with bins and trucks for daily garbage collection. Collaboration between horse cart owners and dealers of UCG is thus needed to phase out illegal dumping, by allowing horse cart owners to dump their daily toll of trash in UCG's trucks, saving them time when compared to their current approach.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative will strengthen the commitment of stakeholders in waste management, and ensure the consistency of waste collection services. This will encourage cooperation between the public sector and the informal private sector to provide solutions together with resilience and above all, to ensure health and environmental protection.\nINTERVENTION AREA:\nSanitation\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nHorse cart owners\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar, UCG\nINITIATIVE TYPE:\nBuilds on existing initiative\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nGovernment \/ UCG\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nContinuous\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nInitiative B.2.3.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tPromote actors' involvement in all aspects of the sanitation sector in Dakar and create channels of access to their products\n\u2022\tFacilitate communication and coordination between industry actors\n\u2022\tStrengthen stakeholders' capacity using an online library with tutorials on technical sanitation and recycling\n\u2022\tDemonstrate waste management value chain\n\u2022\tShift cultural perception on stakeholders in the sanitation value chain\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nAccording to the preliminary resilience assessment, Dakar faces challenges such as inadequate sewage treatment, poor solid waste collection system, and low capacity of human resources. The sanitation sector is not popular in Dakar and actors in the sector are victims of poor public perception for dealing with a sector that for instance, produces recycled or recovered goods. Moreover, when highly appreciated objects (arts and decorative objects, bags, furniture, etc.) are produced in the recycling industry, communication efforts are often insufficient to inform users of supply channels, and investors about investment opportunities. Finally, there are limited formal training programs for actors across the sanitation value chain.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative strengthens the public-private partnership to support economic prosperity while also providing for basic services. It provides users a reliable information base on the sanitation sector and facilitates private sector involvement in sanitation management.\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nNational Patronage Council (CNP); National Agency for Investment and Large Projects Promotion (APIX)\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nINITIATIVE TYPE:\nBuilds on existing initiative\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nPrivate sector (Membership dues); Donors (Not yet identified)\nINTERVENTION AREA:\nSanitation\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nContinuous\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nInitiative B.2.4.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tChallenge local actors to generate innovative ideas for a more effective drainage management system in Dakar\n\u2022\tImplement most feasible and cost effective solutions to reduce floods in Dakar during the rainy seasons\n\u2022\tProvide a healthy environment for residents by reducing occurrence of epidemics related to flooding\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\n30% of Dakar households are not covered by collective liquid sanitation services, thus the use of manual draining methods, or illegal connections to the drainage networks which lead to overload of the drainage networks. In addition, drainage systems are not cleaned frequently and sometimes are turned into dump sites for solid waste. Such situations lead to major floods during the wet season. While the flood situation particularly affects the city of Dakar, the drainage networks are managed at the central government level, through the National Sanitation Organization (Office National de 1'Assainissement du Senegal - ONAS). The municipality of Dakar does not have direct authority over the drainage systems and resources for its management. The initiative thus consists of creating a competition to spur innovative ideas among citizens, the private sector, the academia, etc. in response to the water drainage management system (e.g. drainage cleaning, expanding coverage capacity, behavioral change interventions, recycling, etc.). Most feasible and cost effective solutions could be implemented through PPPs between the National Sanitation Organization (ONAS) and private players, in an effort to combine science and technology with policies and systems.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative empowers local actors to think through their city's challenges and contribute to solving them. Improving water drainage management systems also helps reduce public health hazards risks and makes the city an enjoyable environment for its residents.\nINTERVENTION AREA:\tPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nSanitation\tPrivate investors, youth associations, research institution\nsuch as Institut Africain de Gestion Urbaine (IAGU)\nINITIATIVE TYPE:\nNew\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nGovernment, Donors (Not yet identified)\nACTION LEAD:\tIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nMunicipality of Dakar\tContinuous\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nInitiative B.2.5.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tCoordinate the intervention of horse cart owners in the trash sanitation value chain\n\u2022\tEducate households in sorting trash according to recycling norms\n\u2022\tImprove the performance of the value chain\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nApproximately 38% of the population of the city of Dakar, estimated at 400,000 inhabitants, is not\ncovered in the collective sanitation system43. The waste produced by these populations is collected by independent horse cart owners who do not have proper equipment and dump waste in nature, creating environmental hazards. Furthermore, the delivery system of sorted waste for recycling industry needs is highly disjointed and waste sorting is done in several steps along the chain. This redundancy of activities leads to investing additional resources that increase the cost of waste sorted for recycling. The following statistics characterize the sanitation sector in the city of Dakar:\n\u2022\t850 tons\/day44 of trash generated in the city, and routed to Mbeubeuss;\n\u2022\t38% sand (unnecessary burden in most public bins)45;\n\u2022\t3% of putrescible (reusable compost and fertilizer)46;\n\u2022\t9% plastic (recyclable or recoverable brick, pavers, public toilets, etc.)47;\n\u2022\t~13,000 horse cart owners carrying trash to in illegal dumps because of the distance to the Mbeubeuss central waste dump48;\n\u2022\t40 arbitrary dumps (ecological bombs) in the city, presenting public health hazards.\nThe trash value chain can be made more efficient by reorganizing the intervention of horse cart owners and performing a systematic sorting of waste prior to collection. Organizing the horse cart owners as cooperatives also provides formality for unorganized informal actors, and opportunity to connect them to the sanitation platform49.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative helps empower households to be actors of resilience, and improve their social conditions. It capitalizes on the strength of the informal sector for improved resilience, and ensures the protection of the environment through the reduction of illegal dumping as well as the reduction of the amount of waste sent to landfills.\nINTERVENTION AREA: PRIMARY PARTNERS:\nSanitation\tHorse cart owners, UCG, private investors, district councils,\nAssociation sportive et civique (ASC)\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nContinuous\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nPrimary objective C:\nPosition the private sector as a resilience partner\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nINITIATIVE C.1.1.:\nINITIATIVE C.1.2.:\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nINITIATIVE C.2.1.: INITIATIVE C.2.2.:\nINITIATIVE C.2.3.:\nInitiative C.1.1.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tEnhance collaboration between public sector actors and the private sector\n\u2022\tEstablish a mechanism to ensure compliance with sanitation and energy efficiency standards\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nResilience building activities require collaboration between the public sector (who develops and ensures enforcement of regulations) and the private sector (who facilitates the provision of basic services to populations). However, there is little collaboration between these two sets of actors in regards to compliance with the standards and management of resilience related activities (e.g. weak collaboration between UCG and horse cart owners for waste disposal; lack of coordination between ASN, SENELEC, PROQUELEC, and FESELEC for electrical installation standards, etc.). There is a public-private partnership framework at the national level but it is not applied at the level of the city. This framework could be improved in Dakar to better integrate resilience solutions (effective energy management, waste, etc.). This initiative aims at strengthening the public-private partnership framework by introducing simpler and streamlined processes (simple and less cumbersome procedures) to facilitate collaboration between the two sets of stakeholders.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative advances long term planning and broad stakeholder inclusion. It strengthens the position of the private sector as a driver of resilience.\nINTERVENTION AREA\nTransversal\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nSENELEC, UCG, ONAS\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nContinuous\nINITIATIVE TYPE:\nNew\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nMunicipality\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nInitiative C.1.2.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022 Promote potential benefits that come with integrating resilience in SMEs' activities\n\u2022 Ensure targeted support and enable access to financing mechanisms tailored to SMEs dedicated to sectors that support the city's primary resilience focus areas (sanitation, energy efficiency, protection, and preservation of the environment, etc.)\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nFew companies take into account resilience in their initiatives (e.g. reduced quantities of waste produced, efficient energy management, environmental conservation), or engage in resilience related initiatives (e.g. waste recycling, production of renewable energy, etc.) The main obstacles to private sector investment, in particular SMEs, in activities related to resilience include: (i) lack of information on the potential benefits of such endeavors, (ii) lack of targeted support for SMEs involved in such activities, and (iii) lack of\nappropriate financial mechanisms. To meet these challenges, business development support institutions\n(such as Bureau for SME development, ADEPME, etc.) and incubators in the ICT sector like CTIC will be\nleveraged to initiate programs that support the development of SMEs in activities related to resilience\nthrough (i) establishment of an incubator or resilience lab and (ii) creation of a green financing grant\nmechanism.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative encourages the private sector to participate in resilience related interventions.

Therefore, Dakar citizens consume less local products and have a preference for imported products. Boosting the local economy and local private sector development appear as sustainable means of job creation and strengthening economic resilience, therefore there is a need to encourage and promote the consumption of local products. The intervention consists of creating a label #MadeInDakar, combining both quality assurance, cultural grounding, and community resilience and is an effective way to spur consumption of local products.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative empowers communities to contribute to economic resilience through increased production and consumption of local products, reducing imports and promoting economic growth. It also helps to empower the private sector to provide good quality products and strengthens protection of citizens through assurance of distribution of quality products. Finally, it provides opportunities for creating cooperatives as a channel to formalize informal actors and recycling activities.\nINTERVENTION AREA: PRIMARY PARTNERS:\nTransversal\tNational Council of Employers (CNP); Other associations\nand federations of private companies; town halls; MCSICP-PLPME; Senegalese Agency for Standardization (ASN); Chamber of Commerce and Industry\nACTION LEAD:\tIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nMunicipality of Dakar\tMedium term\nINITIATIVE TYPE:\nNew\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nMunicipality of Dakar, private sector associations\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nInitiative C.2.2.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tPromote consumption of local products and provide economic opportunities for recycled products\n\u2022\tEncourage private sector participation in waste recycling as a means for environmental protection and improved management of the sanitation sector\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nAbout 23% of waste generated in the city of Dakar is composed of putrescible waste (appropriate for making compost and fertilizers); 12% is paper and cardboard (used for manufacturing of office materials, crates for eggs distribution, etc.); and 9% is recyclable plastic (re-usable to create new plastic materials such as pavers, road signs, etc.). Liquid waste can be equally used to process compost or irrigation water used for agricultural production. However, access to markets is a challenge for the expansion of recycling activities, due to negative social perception on recycled products and limited support provided to companies for the promotion of local products (Made in Dakar). The initiative aims at promoting consumption and access to market for recycled products through a quota for recycled products in the administration's procurement system. Products that may be covered include: the provision of office equipment (made from recycled paper); the construction of public assets (streets pavement, traffic lights installation, etc. using recycled plastics); and the maintenance of public spaces (with compost and fertilizer from putrescible waste).\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative promotes local products and import substitution through the #MadeInDakar label and job creation.

The initiative aims to enhance the existing incubator to provide services to the under-represented informal economic sector. In fact, the informal sector contributes to 42% of the economy and employs 48.8% of the active population.51 However, informal businesses lack adequate support to use their full potential to expand and further contribute to economic development and job creation. Many actions have been undertaken to formalize informal firms through sanctions, but have not always been successful. This initiative will bridge gaps in assisting these firms so as to increase their contributions to employment and income while they remain informal.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative promotes local products and import substitution through the #MadeInDakar label and job\ncreation.

For\ninstance, of the 2036 fires registered in 2013, over 50% came from an electrical fault.53 This is due in part to the lack of a systematic compliance monitoring facilities and the limited capacities of the Association for the Promotion of Internal Electrical Installations Quality of Senegal (PROQUELEC).\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative aims to minimize the risks of electricity-related accidents by promoting ownership of\nstandards by users.\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nPROQUELEC; Municipality of Dakar; AEME; ASCOSEN; ASN\nINTERVENTION AREA\nEnergy efficiency\nACTION LEAD:\nMinistry of Energy\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nMedium term\nPROJECT TYPE:\nNew\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nGovernment; donors (not yet identified)\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tEnable citizens to understand that their actions matter and empower them to contribute to energy conservation\n\u2022\tProvide energy conservation guidance to citizens\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nFrequent occurrence of power outages result in economic losses for Dakar: 11.8 power outages occur every month on average.54 These lead to a loss of one percentage point in the city's GDP every year.55 In addition, Demand for electricity will double between 2013 and 203056 due to projected population growth. However, inefficient consumer practices such as the use of incandescent lamps accounting for about 70%57 of Dakar's lighting contribute to energy wastage, and most citizens are unaware of their ability to contribute to energy-saving.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative will sensitize citizens to energy efficiency and influence behavior change in order to curb the current trends of energy consumption and wastage\nPRIMARY PARTNERS:\nMinistry of Energy, AEME, and SENELEC\nINTERVENTION AREA\nEnergy efficiency\nACTION LEAD:\nMunicipality of Dakar\nIMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\nShort term\nPROJECT TYPE:\nNew\nSOURCES OF FUNDING:\nGovernment (through energy efficiency budget) and donors\n(not yet identified)\nAPPLYING THE RESILIENCE LENS\nACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE INITIATIVE\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022\tDemonstrate adoption of innovative technologies towards substantial energy savings\n\u2022\tDemonstrate projected increase in access from energy savings\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nMost commercial buildings in Dakar use 5-6 air conditioning units on average. Most of these lack thermoregulator vis-a-vis external factors, resulting in energy wastage. Gradually installing thermostats in air conditioning units by 2021 could generate energy savings of 51 million kWh between 2017 and 2021, equivalent to 28% of consumption in cooling these buildings in 2013 (or the equivalent of the annual consumption of about 232,000 kWh in Senegal in 2013).58\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative further explores the potential to use energy-efficient technologies to help reduce energy wastage and improve sustainability, through the reduction of greenhouse gases.

This initiative uses energy efficiency as an entry\npoint. However, it does not address the full range of complex energy-related issues.\nOBJECTIVES:\n\u2022 Demonstrate adoption of innovative technologies towards substantial energy savings \u2022 Demonstrate projected increase in access to electricity from energy savings\nOPERATING ASSUMPTION:\nWhile lighting accounts for 23%59 of household electricity consumption at the national level, this\nproportion increases to nearly 50%60 in buildings for professional use. At the national level and in the\ncapital, incandescent lamps represent 70% of the lighting park even though they offer much lower\nperformance than new-generation lamps such as LBC or LED lamps, consume up to five times more\nenergy than LED lamp, and have a life span of 15 to 25 times less. An increase in LED lamp usage to 90% by 2030 in commercial buildings could generate energy savings of 1.4 billion kWh between 2017 and 2030, equivalent to more than 11 times the 2013 lighting consumption (or the equivalent of the annual consumption of nearly 11 million Senegalese in 2013).61 The central government ban \u201cDecree No 2011-160 on January 28th 2011\u201d prohibits import and sale of incandescent lamps but this is yet to be implemented.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThis initiative further explores the potential to use energy-efficient technologies to help reduce energy\nwastage and improve sustainability, through the reduction of greenhouse gases.

Demand for\nelectricity will double between 2013 and 203062 due to projected growth. Since, electricity production\nand management is managed at the central government level, through the SENELEC, ensuring energy\nsufficiency becomes complex as the city has limited control over energy production, distribution, and\nmanagement. Such a situation requires exploring innovative approaches to address the city's energy\nchallenges, by putting ideas of all stakeholders to contribution.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative empowers local actors to think through their city's challenges in regards to energy and\ncontribute to solving them.

There are regional development agencies\n(Agences Regionales de Development - ARD) tasked with ensuring harmonization of national and local interventions within the geographical limits of each municipality. However, for budgetary reasons or planning, monitoring of consultation frameworks and harmonization of national and municipal interventions is not always effective. For example, the Intended nationally determined contribution on climate change (Contribution Prevue Determinee au niveau National - CPDN) provides several initiatives to be implemented in the city of Dakar (e.g. establishment of a Bus Rapid Transit - BRT driver) and also at national level. This could facilitate the vertical and horizontal collaboration that are required to undertake most initiatives as they seek to strengthen existing collaboration frameworks and explore further opportunities.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nThe initiative fosters cross jurisdictional collaboration and empowers a broad range of regional, municipal, and community actors.

The technical staff of public services is often the primary implementer of government initiatives and must be in line with Dakar's resilience agenda. This initiative aims to improve the level of knowledge of the technical staff of public services (municipality of Dakar, and in the 19 communes composing the city of Dakar) about the concept of resilience, and to ensure their capacity to apply a resilience lens in the implementation of public services and initiatives. Some technical services to target in the municipality of Dakar include the Directorate of Planning and Sustainable Development (PDSD), the Urban Development Department (DDU), the Directorate of Technical Services (DST), the Directorate of Health and Action Services to individuals (DASS), the Department of Education and Assistance for Insertion (DEI), etc.\nCONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE:\nMunicipal staff with technical expertise hold primary responsibility for implementation of Dakar's resilience strategy. This initiative empowers public institutions employees to implement initiatives effectively using a resilience lens to fulfill their mandates in this regard.

INSTITUTIONAL\nIMPLEMENTATION SYSTEM\nTHE SIGNING OF FRAMEWORK AGREEMENTS WITH KEY TECHNICAL PARTNERS\nTHE SOLICITATION OF PARTNER PLATFORMS\nWith the advent of decentralization in 1996, the\nterritorial organization of the country has become\nmore complex due to the layering of several levels\nof decentralized authorities (region, departments,\nmunicipalities, county boroughs, and rural communities). At the same time, decentralized local authorities (regions, departments, districts) that represent the territorial command have remained topical.\nActors had nourished the hope that Act 3 of\ndecentralization, in 2013, would reduce this complexity\nby abolishing the region and rural communities from\nan administrative point of view. However, when applied\nto the Dakar Region, Act 3 resulted in the erection\nof 19 self-sufficient towns under the city of Dakar. At\nthe same time, the city of Dakar remains a territorial\nadministration though it cannot make decisions in the\nname of the 19 towns without prior agreement. This\nhas reinforced the hierarchical frustration locally and\nconflicts of causes, competence and power prevail.\nIn addition, the rise of multiple projects, as well as the\nproliferation of structures for their implementation\n(typically known as agencies) has caused malfunctions\nand conflicts given the lack of coordination between\ncentral and local authorities.\nThe implementation of the resilience strategy must take into account this institutional context and encourage the municipality to find new channels of cooperation with\nthe other players at the communal, regional, and national level for concerted action and cooperation. To do this, the Municipality will use various means some of which are listed below:\n\u201c We must focus on strengthening stakeholder capacities of technical services for an effective implementation of the resilience strategy \u201d -\nGovernmental Authority\nTHE CREATION OF AD-HOC COMMITTEES\n5.2.\tMONITORING AND\nEVALUATION MECHANISM\nThe resilience strategy is not a static document. It is called to be reviewed periodically to take into account the economic, social and environmental developments in the city, but always in the spirit of building resilience. In this context, the CRO must ensure that the steering committee, the representative of all stakeholders, continues to exist, to monitor the implementation of actions, and recommend adjustments to the strategic plan.\nMoreover, the capacity of the municipality administration in monitoring and evaluation must be reinforced. The CRO and the Directorate of Planning and Sustainable\nDevelopment can together ensure regular monitoring of the implementation of action plans from the resilience strategy.\nThey will be provided with the human and financial resources and the tools to support these tasks (steering dashboards, IT platform, etc.). The IT platform, when created and is functional, will also be an impact assessment tool for the overall implementation of the strategic plan.

In the past, cities have been living laboratories for major political, social, economic, scientific and technological changes, which have given rise to opportunities for human progress in many areas. People have flocked to cities,\nattracted by the promise of opportunities and in search of a\nbetter life.\nNowhere is this more true than in Bangkok. The heart\nof Thailand, Bangkok plays a central role in national life\nand is almost 40 times larger than the next largest city in\nthe country. Almost all of our country's very substantial\nindustrialisation during the last three decades has taken place in our city and its surroundings. Bangkok's urban primacy has brought, and continues to bring, its residents and the country many opportunities. With such a central and prominent role in the nation's life, Bangkok must succeed. By 2020 the lives of a projected 15 million residents will depend on it.\nTo succeed to 2020 and beyond, Bangkok and its residents\nmust be prepared to face the many shocks and stresses\nthat will continue to challenge our resilience. Rapid and\nwidespread growth has us grappling with increasing\nurbanization. Facilitating mobility for all our residents in\nour sprawling city and catering for the social and economic\nneeds, and health and wellbeing of our diverse and rapidly\ngrowing population, including the poor and vulnerable, are all significant challenges.\nBy virtue of our location in the central region of Thailand,\non the low lying plains of the Chao Phraya River, flooding is\ncommon in Bangkok. With climate change, population growth\nand increasing population density, learning to live with water in new and different ways is one of our most urgent tasks, along with conserving the natural environment on which all life in our city depends.\nGiven the scope and severity of these resilience challenges,\nwe cannot implement sustainable and long lasting resilience\nsolutions on our own. To provide our city and its residents\nwith the opportunities, security and quality of life they long\nfor and deserve, we need all our city organisations, and\nresidents to work together towards shared priorities.\nOnly through united effort can we navigate both the shocks\nand stresses we currently face, and those that loom on the\nhorizon. This Resilience Strategy outlines these priorities.\nIt is a collection of responses to our most important issues\nand a call to action to our city to get involved in their\nimplementation.\nIn today's world, cooperation within cities, as well as between cities, government authorities and regional and international organisations is critical. This Strategy would not have been possible without the inspiration and support of 100 Resilient Cities, Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, and the\nshared experience and learnings of our peers in the 100\nResilient Cities Network. We believe strongly that cooperation with others is the key to finding and implementing sustainable solutions that will not only build resilience for this generation, but for generations to come.\nWe are proud to take our first steps on our resilience journey. As we set out on this journey, this Strategy will be our map; our peers on the 100 Resilient Cities Network and 100 Resilient Cities, our trusted travel companions and allies. Together, we will move forward each day towards a city that is safe, liveable and sustainable for all.\nLETTER FROM MICHAEL\nBERKOWITZ\nPRESIDENT | 100 RESILIENT CITIES\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to\ncongratulate the city of Bangkok, former Governor Mom\nRajawongse Sukhumbhand Paribatra and Governor Pol Gen Aswin Kwanmuang on the release of the city's resilience strategy. A thriving modern metropolis, Bangkok is also a city that cherishes its traditions, with the two coexisting along its storied river and canals. This document honours the vibrant future of both and lays out an extraordinary vision of urban resilience for the residents and neighbourhoods of the entire Bangkok Metropolitan Area.\nSince its early beginnings as the capital of Thailand over 250 years ago, Bangkok has become the beating heart of the country and a major hub for commerce and culture across Asia. As the city continues to adapt to its rapid urbanization and unparalleled growth, this strategy sets out a clear\nvision for the way forward, enabling the city to thrive rather\nthan merely survive its various challenges. This document\naddresses not only the shocks posed by floods and other\ndisasters; it also provides plans for strengthening the city\namid its myriad stresses caused by its continuing expansion. The strategy includes plans for the city's transportation system, provision of city services, and preserving traditional agriculture. It also emphasizes plans for improving the quality of life of all citizens, including and especially its aging population, reducing risks posed by floods and other natural disasters, and building a strong and competitive economy.\nWhile flooding continues to present a major risk, Bangkok\nhas renewed its relationship with the Chao Phraya and the\nthreats it poses. Rather than focusing its resilience strategy\non preparing for major floods, the city has brought a forwardlooking balance to its plans, one that accepts water as an integral part of the city's future, rather than merely a threat\nto it. In this way, and many others, the strategy is designed to turn Bangkok's challenges into opportunities for a more resilient future.\nThrough his energetic leadership in Bangkok, and the 100RC network, Dr. Supachai Tantikom, the city's Chief Resilience Officer, has guided the city to this major moment. The release of Bangkok's strategy is an important milestone for advancing the city's resilience and strengthening the capacity of the city and its partners for coordination, collaboration, and innovation. Importantly, the strategy reflects many lessons learned from the 100RC network and emphasizes further collaboration.\nThough this strategy represents the end of the strategic planning process in Bangkok, it is only the beginning of the exciting work to come in the months and years ahead.\nAnd 100 Resilient Cities' partnership with the city is also just beginning. It is now that we can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively impact the lives of all of those who call Bangkok home, and its many visitors. From its engagement with world-class service providers through the 100 Resilient Cities platform of partners, to its active engagement with the network, Bangkok is well positioned to help us in leading the global urban resilience revolution. We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these efforts.\nCongratulations again on this enormous achievement, and we look forward to our continued partnership in the journey ahead.\nLETTER FROM THE\nCHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER\nFirst and most foremost, I would like to thank all of the\npassionate, professional and dedicated individuals and\norganisations that have contributed their time and forward\nthinking to the Bangkok Resilience Strategy.\nIn particular, I would like to thank the esteemed members of\nour Steering Committee, the Bangkok Resilience Strategy\nWorking Teams and our Strategy Partner, AECOM for helping to make this Strategy everything that it is. I would like that thank former Governor Mom Rajawongse Sukhumbhand Paribatra for bringing this opportunity to Bangkok and\nto Governor Pol Gen Aswin Kwanmuang for carrying this\nstrategy, and the program of activity it outlines, forward.\nWe are grateful to 100 Resilient Cities for providing us\nwith this opportunity to expand our horizons and for their\nconstant and steadfast support in our resilience journey so\nfar. Participation in the 100 Resilient Cities Network has been invaluable to the development of this Strategy. Our peers on the network have taught us much. I hope that this Strategy speaks to the many lessons we have learned.\nBangkok is a city of contrasts. For the most part, Bangkok\nis a vivid, fast-paced metropolis, bursting with modern life.\nIt draws people in from all over the country and the region,\nin search of education, economic opportunity and a higher\nquality of life. But look again and you will see a city steeped in tradition. Historic buildings and temples allude to deep rooted customs.\nUnprecedented changes have taken place within Bangkok\nin the last decade and this pace of change shows no sign of\nslowing down. While rapid growth and industrial success has lifted millions in our city from poverty, such development has not been universal. Massive migration to Bangkok by people seeking better livelihood options has resulted in areas of\ninevitable poverty. Amongst the glittering new condominiums there remain areas of unplanned informal settlements where people live and work, which are unsafe and put people at risk.\nIncreasing urbanization has created a busy and stressful\nlifestyle, congested streets and poor water and air quality.\nOur natural environment and the health of our residents have suffered with ever-expanding development. Such challenges\nwill only be compounded by climate change, which will bring increasing uncertainty and unplanned interruption to our city.\nWith more people than ever before living in, and engaging with our city, it is a critical time for us to break the cycle of reacting to problems and set out on a more deliberate course to ensure that our city is resilient. Only by preparing Bangkokians, our communities, institutions, businesses and systems to survive, adapt and grow no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks we experience, can we bring our city closer to our vision of a city that is safe, liveable and sustainable for all. We must work to improve social services and mobility for all residents. We must ensure no one is left behind, for to be successful, we must lift everyone up.\nTo do this, we have identified three Strategic Action Areas. Each is underpinned by a number of important goals, which are supported by a suite of initiatives and projects. These Strategic Action Areas focus on increasing quality of life, reducing risk and increasing adaptation and driving a strong and competitive economy. A significant challenge for us is to reimagine fundamental problems in our city, such as traffic congestion and flooding, in new and creative ways. In doing so, we will adapt, learn and grow with our environment whilst ensuring that we won't make the mistakes of the past.\nNo longer is it enough for us to only protect Bangkok from flooding, with a changing climate and increasing urban development managing floods will only become more complex. Instead, we must harness water in the city for life and liveability. Our new approach to water management will use green and blue infrastructure - parks and canals, as much as it uses the traditional protection of grey infrastructure - pipes and pumps. This will provide multiple benefits for Bangkok, including contributing towards our goal of growing green space and encouraging environmentally friendly urbanization.\nI am honoured to be able to present Bangkok's first Resilience Strategy, what I hope will be the first of many. This Strategy belongs to all Bangkokians. I hope that it can catalyse new ideas and inspire all of us to work together to build resilience now and into the future.\nTogether with 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration is proud to present this Resilient Bangkok Strategy. The pages that follow outline what we have found to be the most urgent threats to Bangkok's resilience and the integrated and participatory actions that we will take to address them. Our actions will focus on three, interconnected Strategic Action Areas. These are:\nINCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE\nREDUCING RISK AND INCREASING ADAPTATION\nDRIVING A STRONG AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMY\nEach Strategic Action Area comprises a number of goals and each goal has a range of initiatives with specific, implementable projects. A summary of all Strategic Action Areas is provided on page 37 and all goals, initiatives and projects are summarized on page 14-116.\nINCREASING QUALITY\nOF LIFE\nBangkok supports over 8 million people in the city, and over 14 million in its metropolitan area, who travel to and from work, access healthcare, and partake in entertainment and recreation. To ensure that our residents can experience an increased quality of life, we will work to improve social\nservices and mobility for all residents.\nThis Strategic Action Area has three goals:\n\u2022 Health and wellbeing for all city residents, now and into the future\n\u2022 Safe, accessible and convenient transportation network; and\n\u2022 Environmentally friendly urbanization.\nEnsuring our healthcare and facilities meet the\nevolving needs of an ageing population will be\ncentral to achieving our goals. We will work to\npromote and facilitate the benefits of a healthy\nlifestyle, through infrastructure change and\nengagement with the community. We will improve mobility and connectivity through actions that will contribute to a safe, accessible and convenient\ntransportation network and promote green space in urban areas to make the city a more pleasant and accessible place to live and work.\nREDUCING RISK AND\nINCREASING ADAPTATION\nClimate change, urbanization and globalization will bring\nincreasing uncertainty and unplanned interruption to\nBangkok. By supporting and strengthening community-led\ndisaster risk reduction actions and increasing institutional\nadaptive capacity, we will support all of Bangkok's residents to better adapt to natural and human hazards and the increasing risks posed by climate change.\nThis Strategic Action Area has three goals:\n\u2022 Improving resilience to floods\n\u2022 Increasing public and community-driven action on awareness, preparedness and adaptation; and\n\u2022 Stronger institutional capacity and regulation.\nWhile identifying and planning for foreseeable risks is an\nimportant part of disaster risk reduction, we will also build\nresilience in our communities so that they can withstand a\nrange of shocks and stresses, even those that are unforeseen\nDRIVING A STRONG AND\nCOMPETITIVE ECONOMY\nBangkok's economy is inextricably connected to the global\neconomy, bringing opportunities for economic diversity and\ngrowth through trade, tourism, and investment. Increasing\ninterconnections and interdependencies also introduce\nsignificant volatility and vulnerability into our economy. While the city cannot shield itself entirely from this volatility, there is much that can be done to ensure our economy is strong, efficient, accessible, and competitive. We will drive a strong and competitive economy through economic diversification, both in terms of industries and in employment opportunities for our residents.\nThis Strategic Action Area has two goals:\n\u2022 Facilitating city and community-based economy; and\n\u2022 Expanding tourism, service industry and hospitality.\nTo achieve these goals we will work to cultivate our world-\nrenowned tourism and service industries by developing a\nroadmap for our tourism sector and by supporting tourism\nproviders with business development training. We will explore opportunities for technological advancement, which can facilitate higher skilled and higher paying jobs and support a diverse range of community-based livelihoods.\nBangkok has come a long way since it became the capital\nof Thailand in 1782. The past 250 years has seen the city\nchange from a small fortress town on the eastern bank of\nthe Chao Phraya River into one of South East Asia's most\nprosperous and modern cities. But while history has been\nkind to the city, it has also been cruel. Bangkok has faced, and will continue to struggle with severe financial crises, floods, political unrest and other significant disruptions amidst the slow burning stress caused by increasing inequality and\nrampant urbanization. Such challenges have often left the\ncity struggling to catch up. This strategy marks an important step forward for Bangkok. We are well and truly into the 21st century now. Perhaps lessons from the 21st century tell us that change and growth will be unparalleled, but we will not be\nscrambling to catch up, instead we will be well ahead.\nEARLY CITY STRUCTURE AND PLANNING\nCanals were used as a planning tool and were a central part of urban land use planning policy during the period of King Rama I. The city was divided into three parts by the canals: inner Bangkok, outer Bangkok, and the area outside the city wall. People settled along both sides of the river and developed an extensive network of canals as their main mode of transport. To this day, thousands of people get around the city using an extensive network of large and small river and canal boats. Freight is transported up the Chao Phraya to Northern provinces, and down to the Gulf of Thailand on barges. The importance of roads in attracting national and global investment emerged in 1851, led by King Rama IV, with rail and tram transport connecting Bangkok to neighbouring areas.\nOver the next century Bangkok's development accelerated,\nattracting people from across Asia to live and work together, building over fields and canals in the process, to create one of the world's largest and most dynamic city hubs. The city's rapid growth and industrial success has made it a magnet for migration from across the country and beyond, marking the beginning of a trend of rapid urbanization, which to this day, shows no signs of slowing down.\nINFLUENCE OF TRADE\nWestern trade has had a big influence on the growth\nof Bangkok. Thailand has a long history of agricultural\nproduction, trading with the West and China to become a\nworld centre for rice and rubber. In the 20th Century, the\nChao Phraya and its delta developed quickly to support\nport facilities, warehouses, shipyards, and rice mills; all built\nby thousands of labourers. Over the decades and with the\ninfluence of globalization, Thailand has grown its export\nindustries beyond agricultural products to include vehicles,\nelectronics, heavy and light machinery, plastics and refined\npetroleum to become one of the major exporting countries in the region and the 22nd largest exporter in the world.\nNow Bangkok is a thriving commercial hub supported\nby world-class government infrastructure including two\ninternational airports, stadia, numerous beautifully designed\nbridges, and mass transport systems. Bangkok is studded with stunning temples and palaces, traditional markets and houses, and still supports ancient crafts and a food culture that is\nunparalleled. Its unique blend of ancient and modern ways of life creates a bustling and fascinating city.\nCITY IMPORTANCE AND\nNATIONAL AND REGIONAL CONTEXT\nDespite its short history in comparison to other globally\nimportant cities, the Bangkok Metropolitan Area has quickly burgeoned to a vast sprawling megacity over 1568 square kilometres, hosting over 14 million people. Bangkok's role and importance as a primate city in comparison to Thailand's other cities is unparalleled in Asia. Over a fifth of Thailand's population and the vast majority of the nation's financial, commercial and government responsibility is concentrated there.\nThailand has demonstrated\nremarkable economic progress\nexperiencing 21 per cent growth in\nForeign Direct Investment inflows\nover the past 6 years, compared\nto the global percentage of 0.7%.\nOccupying the 4th rank in Asia's\ntop prospective host economies,\nThailand has gained a solid reputation as a second home for various global multinational enterprises (MNEs).\nBangkok's strategic role as capital and driver of Thailand's national economy, along with an industrial centre on the Eastern Seaboard, gives it regional as well as national importance. Its location and facilities provide attractive opportunities for companies to invest and workers to settle. This migration from across the world, neighbouring countries and Thai provinces gives Bangkok its unique, multicultural diversity and dynamism.\nThe rapid growth of the city, and its changing role within Thailand, Asia and the world, has not been without its challenges. Some areas of the city have experienced intense, unplanned urban growth and an unsustainable increase in population density. Due to this, authorities struggle to provide sufficient public services and ensure compliance to safety and land use regulation. Programs for upgrading public infrastructure, regenerating housing, reforming land tenure and documenting migrants have helped to rectify many areas of risk in urban areas. However, Bangkok's constant change and growth remains a challenge, driving vulnerabilities to hazards, safety, health, poverty and people's well being..\nCITY DYNAMICS\nURBANIZATION\nOver the last 250 years Bangkok has blossomed from a small fortress town to a 21st century megalopolis. Today, the built up area of Bangkok is almost 16 times greater than in 1958. The\nregistered population in Bangkok increased from 1.6 million\nin 1958 to 5.4 million in 1986 and is projected to grow to 15.32 million in 2020 [1]. A great number of unregistered people also live and commute into Bangkok, swelling its official\nnumbers. These bustling and exciting mixes of international\nand Thai people compete for, and also provide, its unique\nservices. Bangkok is world renowned for its incredible street\nfood, shopping and architecture and as a base for important\ntourism and business sectors.\nThe way traditional and modern practices come together is a critical part of its attractiveness to visitors and those who live here. It also reflects, and caters for a significant income divide, which is experienced in most large cities. The authorities, as well as Bangkok's citizens, are working to build their economic opportunities, and it is critical that legislative, social and\ngovernance structures support fair livelihood opportunities\nfor all Bangkokians individually to contribute to the country's economy.\ndrainage, suitable road layouts and electricity and create urban areas that promote safe and healthy buildings and lifestyles, growth must be well planned and regulated. This is a great challenge in a city experiencing rapid growth.\nBangkok is situated on low-lying flat land, below sea-level in some areas. Originally this land was well suited to serving as rice paddy fields, and as the flood plain for the Chao Phraya River and its many tributaries that drain the massive monsoon rains into the Gulf of Thailand. This land has now largely been developed and houses many residents, business and transport corridors. There are a great many people and their livelihoods, as well as productive industries, including important foreign direct investment relying on this flood-prone land remaining safe, despite the difficult location.\nEffective control of land use in Bangkok influences a great number of other development areas including industrial and agricultural output, transportation, water and food security, environmental protection, climate change, drainage and solid waste management, subsidence control, migration and illegal immigration, disaster mitigation and social welfare.\nRecent electric-powered underground and overhead (\u2018BTS Skytrain') transport links have provided many commuters with traffic-free, but relatively expensive options; however old buses and an ever-growing number of cars, vans and trucks continue to be a critical way to transport goods and people around the city. Blocked roads and harmful carbon monoxide emissions cause difficulties as well as serious health issues. The city needs a complex and widespread system of rail, boat, skytrain and underground mass transit systems to answer all the requirements for a cheap, resilient and extensive public transport system which reaches to the suburbs where most residents need it\nThe government has prioritized public awareness initiatives and activities relating to traffic control and driving quality across Thailand. Bangkok has seen greater enforcement of traffic and safety violations and safety rules which contribute to risk as well as overall traffic congestion. But challenges remain for road-building, including a shortage of funds to extend the road network and difficulties in expropriating private land for road construction.\nThe extensive use of motorcycles and tuk-tuks gives Bangkok a unique quality. These vehicles do contribute to road safety issues although the city has been successful in introducing regulations to increase the quality and safety of motorcycle taxis. The roads and sidewalks remain notoriously dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians, as well as unpleasant because of noxious fumes.\nBesides the immediate costs of congestion, including long\ncommute times and blocking the access for first responder\nvehicles such as police and ambulances, vehicle emissions\nare the greatest source of air pollutants in Bangkok. This\nis becoming one of the city's most pressing health risks.\nAir quality monitoring performed by the Pollution Control\nDepartment (PCD) indicates that in Bangkok 24-hour\naverage values of particle pollution exceeded air quality\nstandards. Areas found to exceed particulate pollution on a\ndaily basis are: Din Daeng District, Rat Burana District, Phra\nKhanong District, Chatuchak District, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ratchathewi District, Ratchathewi District Office and Pathum Wan District [4].\nTo compound this air pollution, Bangkok has one of the lowest percentages of green areas of any major capital in Asia. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Asian Green City Index 2011, commissioned by Siemens, on average, urban citizens in Asia enjoy 39 sq.m. of green space each, while Bangkok has a mere 3sq.m. each [5] Economist Intelligence Unit. (2011) Asian Green City index. Green areas act as a CO2 sink and filter many pollutants from the air, thereby improving air quality and lowering the health risk. Resilient development that balances environmental conservation, and the health and well being of the population remains a challenge for Bangkok [6].\nWASTE AND WATER\nAlthough the municipal authority has been active in solid waste management since 1915, solid waste is a major concern for Bangkok. The daily municipal waste generated by city dwellers and from light industry is growing rapidly, from 7,000 tonnes per day in 1993 to around 8,800 tonnes per day in 2014, and expected to reach 11,500 tonnes per day by 2025.\nBangkok faces challenges related to the separation of solid waste once collected. Much of this waste could be dealt with more sustainably. Around 14 per cent is recyclable, and up to 48 per cent is organic waste and could be mulched, incinerated or otherwise disposed of. In response to this challenge, the city is focusing on improving the efficiency of organic waste management and supporting solid waste reuse and recycling.\nThe Chao Phraya and Mae Klong Rivers are the main source of potable water supply to the city. However, domestic, industrial and agricultural waste provide water purification challenges, and cause physical blockages. Water from ground sources is known to be limited and at risk, and its use by industry has caused concerning subsidence of the entire delta area.\nThe city is located on layers of soft clay, which provide numerous problems for heavy infrastructure. The overpumping of ground water out of aquifers under this clay causes ground settlement which is experienced as land subsidence across the city. The subsidence reached its most critical state in the early 1980s when it occurred at a rate as high as 120 mm\/year. Active management of ground water use has allowed the subsidence rate to decrease but the threat remains. Bangkok is also situated between 1 metre below and 2 metres above mean sea level. Those areas below sea level are particularly vulnerable to any changes in water level. This threat will become more important as relative sea-levels rise, both from subsidence and as a result of a changing climate. Relative sea-level rise increases the risk of salt-water incursion into the Chao Phraya River as well as increasing flood risk in the delta as water drains slower in times of flood and high river water.\nINEQUALITY LEAVING PEOPLE WITHOUT\nBASIC NEEDS\nMassive migration to Bangkok by people seeking good\nlivelihood options and security has resulted in areas of\ninevitable poverty or illegal status which are currently\nuncatered for. There remain areas of unplanned informal\nbuilding where people live and work in places which are\nunsafe, unsanitary and lack basic service provision, putting\npeople at risk. It is estimated by some social work NGOs that up to 20% of Bangkok's residents live on squatter settlements [7]. The precarious social and legal positions of residents\nmean they do not receive the full set of public services which can reduce risk, such as waste collection, pest control and storm-drain clearance, which makes them more vulnerable to flood, health problems and other hazards [7].\nOne example of a squatter settlement is in Klong Toei, to the\nSouth East of Bangkok's city center which has been home\nto a diverse community of an estimated 80,000 people,\nincluding migrants to Bangkok, for more than half a century.\nResidents of this community live in uncertain financial, legal,\nand social conditions and work together to try to survive in\nan environment which can put them at massive risk [8]. Flood risk from the adjoining Chao Phraya puts residents at risk of damage to their belongings, health, education, safety and\nsource of income, causing greater poverty and dependence.\nFlood risk, and its impacts on health, livelihoods and safety,\nwould be mitigated if the community was provided with\ncertain public services, but their unregistered and illegal status makes it difficult for government agencies to justify this work.\nUndocumented workers are vulnerable to exploitation and\noften suffer poor working conditions and low wages. The\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM) in Bangkok\nstated after the 2011 floods that migrants are particularly\nat risk of being arrested, deported and fined after disasters.\nAny work permits and registration documents owned often\nget destroyed, and people are limited to the province where\nthey were first registered despite losing livelihoods and\noutstanding pay.\nFLOOD RISK\nFlood is a natural phenomenon in the Chao Phraya River Basin. Bangkok's situation, on the lower basin, on flat land reaching towards a low-lying delta, means up to 4 km on either side of the river is the natural flood plain. Bangkok has always received floodwater during the 5-month long annual monsoon. In the past, fields, canals, irrigation channels and both natural and man-made flood retention areas (known in Thai as \u2018Gamling' or Monkey Cheeks as they hold water) acted to reduce flood impacts. The flood water was even utilized for farming rice tolerant to high water events.\nWith the trend of urbanization, water bodies were slowly replaced by settlements and roads, and Bangkok started to experience floods as one of the first recognized urban hazards. Urban ground cover affects not only the direction of the water flow but flood depth, velocity and duration.\nThe building of flood barriers in some places has protected those areas, sometimes putting other areas at greater risk, or allowing people to build behind barriers which cannot fully protect them from all floods, and can fail [9]. Now, complex urban systems, including electricity, transport, communications, drinking water supply, livelihoods and many other elements are more likely to be disturbed as they are concentrated in a locations exposed to flood. Wider systems, including the management of water flow elsewhere in the Chao Phraya River Basin, also impact on what is experienced in Bangkok. Rainfall throughout the region is subject to unpredictability as a result of climatic changes making it more difficult to regulate dams and river flows to meet the needs of farmers and industry upriver, and protect households in both rural and urban areas [10].\nIn 1917 and 1942, Bangkok experienced devastating floods.\nThe city also experienced floods during 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1983 and 1995. 2011 saw Thailand experience a historically devastating flood with a significant impact to Bangkok and its surrounding areas. Among the complex causes of the flood were the natural effects of extreme monsoon rainfall and the low capacity of upstream rivers, but also changes to land use and water management including urbanization on the flood zones, diversion of water through certain channels, dam height and lack of proper maintenance of water structures [9].\nCHALLENGES TO BUILDING\nRESILIENCE TO SHOCKS AND\nSTRESSES\nCOMMUNITY RESILIENCE IN URBAN\nSETTINGS\nRisks posed by shocks and stresses can be reduced by\ncommunities working together to prepare and protect\neach other from vulnerabilities and to recover quickly. It is\nrecognized that building a strong, unified and fair community within a diverse and dynamic urban setting is a huge challenge. Bangkok is a huge, sprawling city, bolstered each day by millions of commuters and tourists. Different agendas, languages and levels of wealth, to name a few criteria, illustrate some of the barriers to encouraging people to work together for a stronger and safer Bangkok, and support each other. The responsibility of providing a safe and productive city for all inhabitants remains with the authorities, but community resilience-building could be a tool used by BMA, NGOs and others to help bring people together to be aware of and mitigate risks created in the city.\nGetting community participation for resilience could be based upon the unique way in which urban communities have been formed in the Bangkok vicinity. A number of communities\nhave the potential to take community-driven initiatives for\nresilience that would complement risk-reduction initiatives\nby the authorities. Some communities exist within temples,\nmosques, churches, in common business activity areas,\nand around local markets who may be able to self-organize\ntowards a common goal of resilience, while promoting\ngenerosity and equality. Newcomers sharing living space such as residents of condominiums and housing estates could also form communities to support resilience building [11].\nECONOMIC DYNAMICS\nBangkok is inextricably linked to the global economy. This\nbrings trade, tourism, investment and great opportunities\nfor diversity and growth. It also exposes the economy to\nworld market fluctuations and competition. This was borne\nout in the East Asia financial crash of the late 1990s where\nweaknesses in Asian financial systems plunged Thailand and\nits neighbours' economy into a deep recession. Being export-dependent, Thailand's economies is vulnerable to shocks and stresses, including those brought by climatic phenomena and political unrest. Drought affects agricultural production and trade frequently.\nThe 2011 Thailand floods caused approximately 1.4 trillion\nTHB (USD 47 billion) of economic damage. Many publicly\nowned companies faced a huge challenge to return to normal production levels and the country had to actively bolster foreign investor confidence in Thailand's resilience [12]. In the aftermath of the 2011 floods, the Thai government initiated a National Disaster Fund of 50.0 billion THB (USD 1.4 billion) to support the provision of natural disaster risk coverage to households, small firms and industries.\nThailand's recent period of political unrest also poses a risk\nto the city's fragile economic recovery following the 2011\nflood event. The Asia Development Bank lowered predictions for Thailand's growth from 3.6 percent to 3.2 per cent, citing contracted merchandise exports and deterioration of Thailand's consumer confidence index. Despite this, tourism numbers have been steadily rising since their slump in 2013 and 2014, following a period of unrest. Bangkok was recently recognized as the world's most visited city, and the country relies heavily on tourism, which accounts for roughly 15 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nGrass-roots businesses, known as micro, small and medium\nenterprises (MSMEs) such as small shops, street food sellers and self-employed domestic workers are at great risk from physical, social, legislative and economic shocks; and are less able to adapt themselves quickly to prepare or build back better after an event. Supporting MSME's to build resilient businesses will help Bangkok's economy to be stronger in the face of shocks and stresses.\nINEQUALITY\nOver the last four decades, Thailand's economy has grown remarkably, moving from a low-income country to an upper-middle income country in less than a generation. As such, Thailand is a widely cited development story, with sustained strong growth and impressive poverty reduction, particularly in the 1980s. However, access to these economic opportunities is unequal, and many Bangkok residents still live in informal settlements, and in poverty.\nIt has been recognized that there is an unequal distribution of risk. Livelihoods and accommodation that are more exposed to the elements, poor quality buildings and air quality are often taken by poorer people, putting them at greater exposure to hazards without giving the capacity to manage the risks.\nThe income divide between average wages in Bangkok compared to Thailand's other provinces, as well as between social strata within Bangkok, puts some at much greater risk than others. It is critical that authorities create an enabling environment for everyone who is impacted by the management of Bangkok to be able to participate in developing and challenging that policy to create a resilient, wonderful city that has opportunities and safeguards for all.\nThere have been numerous coup d'etat's in Thailand in recent decades. Political instability at a national level has ramifications for the city. Riots and protests have physically taken place in Bangkok, adversely impacting tourism and disrupting services. Since May 2014, Thailand has been governed at a national level by a military government, called the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), which has brought some stability to the country, and the capital. The NCPO has since drafted a new constitution which paves the way for a general election to take place in 2017 and with it greater political stability for the country.\n100 RESILIENT CITIES\n100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) helps cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a\ngrowing part of the 21st century. Bangkok's application was\nselected from almost 1100 that were submitted by cities from around the world.\nAs a part of the network, Bangkok receives funding for a Chief Resilience Officer to coordinate resilience efforts across the city, including the development of this strategy. It also has access to the experience and expertise of other cities in the network and the 100RC platform; a group of leading service providers who offer in-kind support to member cities. In this way, Bangkok joins a global community of urban resilience practitioners implementing integrated, city-wide resilience actions around the world.\nDRIVING CHANGE IN BANGKOK\nThe Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), organized\nin accordance with the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Act 1985, is responsible for the management of the city of Bangkok. It is the sole organization at the local authority level responsible for the well being of Bangkok residents with some financial support from the central government.\nBangkok has made a step forward in setting a long-term\nfuturistic vision as a blueprint for the city to grow. The\nBangkok Vision 2032 \u201cBangkok: Vibrant of Asia\u201d, an outcome of initiatives jointly conducted by BMA and Chulalongkorn University, reflects people-centred perspectives on what Bangkok should look like and how to reach that desirable future. It highlights six strategic dimensions: Safe City,\nGreen City, City for All, Compact City, Democratic City, and\nEconomic and Capitalise Knowledge-based City. It also has\nperformance measures to achieve concrete outcomes.\nThe three Strategic Action Areas outlined in this resilience\nstrategy will compliment Bangkok's vision for the future. It\nwill work alongside the city's investments to upgrade and\ntransform city systems to ensure that Bangkok is a safe,\nliveable and sustainable city for all by increasing quality of life, reducing risk and increasing adaptation and driving a strong and competitive economy.\nThis will not only allow the city to fulfil its functions as\nenvisaged for the future, but also reduce the impacts of\nshocks and stresses, ensuring that all city residents will be\nable to share and enjoy the development gains accumulating over time without serious interruption.\nThis task will not be easy. Implementation will be an ongoing\nchallenge to ensure alignment and coordination between\nsiloed city departments in a city that is rapidly changing. From an ever-growing population, to urban expansion and a thriving young manufacturing industry, Bangkok is hurtling forward\nand challenging its administrators to catch-up. In recognition of this, this strategy represents a serious commitment from BMA to resilience building efforts to ensure that the city\nnot only grows but that it brings all residents along on that\njourney.\nThis section outlines a program of interrelated actions that will work together to build resilience across Bangkok. It is made up of three Strategic Action Areas designed to bring Bangkok closer to its vision of a safe, liveable and sustainable city for all. These action areas are:\nINCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH:\nGOAL 1: Health and wellbeing for all city residents, now and into the future\nGOAL 2: Safe, accessible and convenient transportation network\nGOAL 3: Environmentally friendly urbanization\nREDUCING RISK AND INCREASING ADAPTATION THROUGH:\nGOAL 4: Improving resilience to floods\nGOAL 5: Increasing public and community-driven action on awareness, preparedness and adaptation GOAL 6: institutional capacity and regulation\nDRIVING A STRONG AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMY THROUGH:\nGOAL 7: Facilitating city and community-based economy GOAL 8: Expanding tourism, service industry and hospitality\nEach action area comprises a series of goals for the city. To achieve each of these goals, Bangkok will implement a broad program of activities with specific, implementable subactions. Some will be implemented directly by BMA, others will be delivered in partnership with a range of private and public sector organizations. Most are new initiatives designed to fill recognized gaps in the city's current capabilities, while some are existing projects that will be expanded or improved to fully realise their resilience benefits. Implementing projects, like the benefits they will generate, will unfold over the short, medium and long term.\nThese actions are the first set of actions that look at city-wide initiatives in a different way, to consider how one action can address multiple problems and provide multiple benefits, as well as how stakeholders can better work together to achieve resilience outcomes for the city. They will not be the last. To become a truly resilient city will require many hands, much work and constant evolution.\nSTRATEGIC ACTION\nAREA 1: INCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE\nGOAL 1: HEALTH AND WELLBEING FOR ALL CITY RESIDENTS, NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE\nGOAL 2: SAFE, ACCESSIBLE AND CONVENIENT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK\nGOAL 3: ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY\nURBANIZATION (GREEN SPACE, POLLUTION, TRAFFIC)\nGOAL 1: HEALTH AND WELLBEING FOR ALL CITY RESIDENTS, NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE\nTo address health-related issues and the physical wellbeing of different population segments in the city, this goal will focus on improving systems to deliver comprehensive health care services. Specific groups who are vulnerable to health conditions, including the elderly, migrant workers, and those living in squalid environments will benefit from the following interventions:\nPromoting healthy living and lifestyles Epidemic prevention in urban communities Preparing for quality ageing.\n1.1\tPROMOTING HEALTHY LIVING AND LIFESTYLES\nLIVING IN A BUSY CITY CAN RESULT IN LESS HEALTHY LIFESTYLES, WHICH CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF NON-\nCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES, INCLUDING DIABETES. IN SUPPORT OF HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES, BMA WILL IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING PROJECT AS PART OF THIS RESILIENCE STRATEGY.\n1.1.1\tSCREENING FOR DIABETES AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IN PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 21\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nHealth Promotion Division, Health Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nEarly detection of diseases in new patients will ensure early treatment, reducing strain on the healthcare system, and reducing the severity of illnesses and mortality rates. It will also encourage early intervention in unhealthy lifestyles and help promote healthier habits among city residents. A healthier population will be better positioned to engage in city life and contribute to the community.\nEating habits are a leading risk factor for health problems for the residents of Bangkok. Junk food and lack of proper exercise leads to problems such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. Younger generations in particular increasingly face health issues such as heart disease and depression. This initiative will raise awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle and provide opportunities for healthcare providers to engage with residents about their daily habits, facilitating the early detection and prevention of non-communicable diseases.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project will work with healthcare providers to establish screening programs for high blood pressure in people aged over 21. This screening program will also raise awareness among the target group about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.\nTIMELINE:\nOngoing, starting in 2017\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents aged 21 and above.\n1.2\tEPIDEMIC PREVENTION IN URBAN COMMUNITIES\nFOR BANGKOK TO ACHIEVE HEALTH AND WELLBEING FOR ALL, VIGOROUS ACTIONS ON EPIDEMIC PREVENTION\nARE CRITICAL, PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEALTH PROBLEMS AND INFECTIOUS\nDISEASES. CONSISTING OF THE TWO SUB-PROJECTS DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS INITIATIVE WILL FOCUS ON EPIDEMIC PREVENTION AND CONTROL IN THE MIGRANT WORKER HOUSING AT CONSTRUCTION SITES ACROSS BANGKOK.\nIT WILL ENHANCE DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND IMPROVE LIVING CONDITIONS FOR\nLABOURERS AND MIGRANT WORKERS.\n1.2.1\tEVENT BASED SURVEILLANCE FOR PANDEMICS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nHealth Department of BMA, Institute of Urban Disease Control of Ministry of Public Health, and Private Health units\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nBy developing an integrated,\ncommunity-based network of disease surveillance and health standards for migrant worker housing, healthcare can be extended to the city's large\npopulation of unregistered migrants and illegal workers. This will increase the quality of life of migrant workers in over 300 camps across Bangkok.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of Bangkok, labourers and workers.\nEvery year a significant number of workers, particularly migrant workers, suffer\nfrom communicable diseases due to complicated risk factors associated with\nworking conditions, migrant worker housing environments, and health practices.\nAs the city continues to grow, with a reliance on migrant workers and labor forces as the backbone of construction activities, it is essential that disease prevention and control systems are inclusive of health-related issues and epidemic control for this vulnerable group.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe project will focus on developing comprehensive systems for epidemic control and prevention among labour forces and migrant workers. This includes activities ranging from medical screening, integrated network surveillance, vaccination, and improving sanitation, to developing regulations that mandate disease surveillance in campsites and the use of media for health risk communication.\nBMA - together with Ministry of Public Health, public and private health care units including hospitals, clinics, and community health centers - will play crucial roles in implementing these activities with support from surveillance networks including occupational health and safety officers and volunteers.\nTIMELINE:\n2 Years\n1.2.2\tIMPROVING WORK PLACES AND LIVING CONDITIONS FOR MIGRANT WORKERS IN BANGKOK\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nEnvironmental Sanitation and Health Department of BMA; Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health; Institute for Urban Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health; Public Health Law Centre.\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThese measures will help to ensure\nminimum standards in workplaces\nand housing which caters to migrant workers. This will contribute to increasing the quality of life for these residents and improving health outcomes for migrant workers.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nMigrant workers in Bangkok.\nIt is critical that health and safety regulations and standards are complied with at\nall employment places to ensure the well being of workers. It has been identified\nthat some workplaces, in particular those which employ a high proportion of\nmigrant workers and low-income workers (such as the industrial sector) do not\ncomply, thereby putting this section of society at risk. Moreover, many of these\nworkers live in substandard housing at different locations of the city. This initiative will study the current situation of high risk workplaces, and the living environments of their work, especially of concentrations of migrant workers to ensure a higher\nhealth and safety standard.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThis initiative will be implemented through an in-depth study of workplaces and\nhousing known to have migrant laborers.\nFocus group discussion, interviews and workshops will be conducted to\nunderstand the key issues and improve the quality of working conditions and\nhousing sites.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\n1.3\tPREPARING FOR QUALITY AGEING\nAS THE POPULATION OF BANGKOK REMAINS HEALTHIER INTO OLD AGE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO CATER FOR THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. CONSISTING OF THE THREE SUB-PROJECTS DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS\nINITIATIVE WILL ADDRESS THE IMPLICATIONS OF AGEING FROM VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES - SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, MENTAL, AND BEHAVIOURAL. IT WILL ALSO HELP DEVELOP POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS AGEING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY, AND PROMOTE INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE ELDERLY.\n1.3.1\tSUPPORT FOR ELDERLY RESIDENTS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nGraduate School of Environmental Development Administration, National Institute of Development Administration and BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nSavings schemes and a cooperative approach will increase independence and ensure quality of life for elderly residents.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nElderly residents.\nThe average life expectancy in Thailand has increased notably over the last decade, resulting in an increase in the number of elderly people. Accompanying this are changes in family structure with a trend towards smaller families, leaving an increasing number of elderly people vulnerable to improper attention and care. The situation is more acute in Bangkok, where the family unit is not as strong compared to smaller cities and rural areas in Thailand. This particular initiative aims to understand and put in place a well-designed savings scheme aimed at enabling older savers to become financially independent.\nRisks to the elderly will be researched, including the drivers of stress, crime and safety. Support schemes will be investigated and implemented to build social support and social services for people growing older to remain independent, safe and well.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative aims to design and implement a savings scheme to support elderly residents to be financially secure and independent. This will require a thorough understanding of the current financial needs of the elderly and how these may be better supported.\nRisks to the elderly will be researched, including the drivers of stress, crime and safety. The savings scheme will be accompanied by appropriate social services and programs for the elderly to more fully support this growing group in our community to remain independent, safe and well.\nTIMELINE:\n3-5 Years\n1.3.2\tPREPARING THE POPULATION AGED 18 - 59 FOR OLD AGE\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nHealth Promotion Division, Health\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nBy supporting residents to prepare\nfor old age earlier in life, the city\nis taking a proactive approach\nto facilitating quality ageing in\nall residents. This include more\nopportunities for elderly residents to participate in city life, to interact and form networks with each other and to develop healthy habits and financial security into old age.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nCitizens of Bangkok aged 18-59.\nA key element of community resilience is social cohesion which is a recognized\nchallenge in urban places. In particular, older people can be supported well by\nfamilies, neighbours and others by working together to look after their social and\nphysical needs. The social structure of Bangkok is becoming more modernized and isolated and less family-oriented. It is important to raise the awareness of 18-59 year old Bangkokians about social responsibility to encourage them to help each other to meet the current and future needs of older people in the city.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative has two objectives: to build awareness in the population of what they will require as they age and what they can do now to prepare for old age (savings, social networks, etc.), and; to build stronger social networks by connecting\nthe younger population to older residents through various activities including\neducation, religion, culture and sport.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year (starting 2017-2018 with continuation in the future)\n1.3.3\tACCESSIBILITY AND SAFETY OF TRANSPORT OPTIONS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nGraduate School of Environmental Development Administration; National Institute of Development Administration; Traffic and Transportation Department, BMA Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning, Ministry of Transport\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nCurrent gaps in transportation system facilities for elderly people will be better understood allowing for interventions that will empower elderly residents to move about the city and reduce isolation.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nSenior Citizens of Bangkok.\nBy 2021, around 20 per cent of the population of Bangkok will be considered elderly. The current transportation system does not cater the needs of elderly people, limiting their ability to travel on their own and increasing isolation. This initiative will focus on understanding the current system's shortcomings and future needs for accessible and safe transport options.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThis study will undertake primary research to better understand the existing shortcomings of Bangkok's transportation system. It will include physical investigations of existing infrastructure, as well as interviews with older residents to understand their needs and the ways in which existing systems are failing to meet these needs. Attention will be given to identifying required facilities for elderly people.\nTIMELINE:\n3-5 years\nGOAL 2: SAFE,\nACCESSIBLE AND\nCONVENIENT\nTRANSPORTATION\nNETWORK\nThe mobility of Bangkok residents is currently limited by significant traffic and inadequate and over-capacity public transport systems. These are complicated and interrelated issues - new thinking will be needed if we are to provide safe, accessible and convenient solutions that meet the diverse needs of different segments of the population. This means being resourceful and building redundancy into transport systems, trialling multiple options to reduce traffic congestion and providing alternative networks and connection points. Interventions include:\n\u2022\tAn integrated mass transport system\n\u2022\tImproving traffic flow in the city\nReducing road related deaths through influencing driver behaviour and new technologies.\n2.1\tINTEGRATED MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEM\nMASS TRANSIT SYSTEMS ARE WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO TRAFFIC\nCONGESTION IN MEGA-CITIES. TO MAKE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM IN BANGKOK MORE EFFECTIVE, LINKING ITS MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM TO THE CITY'S OTHER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS WILL MAXIMISE ITS USE AS A FAST, SAFE AND CONVENIENT WAY TO TRAVEL CURRENTLY, BANGKOK HAS A SKYTRAIN, AIRPORT LINK AND MASS RAPID TRANSPORT. UNDER THE CURRENT PLAN, DUE TO BE DELIVERED BY 2029, THIS WILL BE EXPANDED TO 548 KM. BETTER CONNECTING THESE SYSTEMS IS THE CORE OF THIS GOAL. BMA WILL IMPLEMENT THREE KEY INITIATIVES FOR THE INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, TO INCREASE CONNECTIVITY AND EXPAND THE LINKAGES BETWEEN DIFFERENT TRANSPORTATION MODES ACROSS BANGKOK, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.\n2.1.1\tINTEGRATED MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEM MASTER PLAN\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nTraffic and Transportation\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nMobility is integral to the quality of\nlife of Bangkok residents. Investing in a robust, integrated transport system will facilitate safer, more equitable\nand efficient movement of people\nin the city and reduce the use of\nprivate vehicles and their associated environmental impacts, while stimulating economic growth.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of Bangkok and visitors.\nThailand began developing its mass transit system in 1994 to cover a total distance of 373 kilometers. This comprises a connected system of underground railway lines (subway), BTS (sky train lines), and an Airport Rail Link. To increase mobility in\nBangkok and populated suburban areas, secondary public transportation systems such as a monorail and light rail have been planned, aiming to expand coverage of the mass transit system and provide convenient access to different points across Bangkok.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThe project will develop a master plan for an integrated transport system,\nincluding the Mass Transit Master Plan, feeder system and other modes of public\ntransportation such as bus and water transport to ensure connectivity across the\ncity.\nTo maximize the use of an integrated and robust public transportation system in\nBangkok, the Master Plan and budget for system operation will be prepared based on detailed studies, review and analysis of relevant research on secondary public transportation systems, physical volumes of traffic data and mobility information, forecasting public transit use and passengers, and assessing the efficiency of\nsecondary public transportation in reducing road congestion.\nTIMELINE:\n1 Year\n2.1.2\tEXPANSION OF MONORAIL FEEDER AND LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nTraffic and Transportation\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nMultiple and well-connected mass transportation facilities and networks will be made available for Bangkok residents for safe, fast and convenient daily commuting. This will offer an alternative mode of transportation in Bangkok, and reduce private vehicle use, contributing to a sustainable solution to traffic congestion and vehicle fuel consumption in Bangkok.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of Bangkok.\nMonorail feeders and light rail systems are to form an integral part of Bangkok's mass transit system. Both systems are expected to increase the redundancy of the transport system - providing more residents with multiple mobility options - and provide greater connectivity and access to multiple linkage points, complementing the main Mass Transit Systems. Construction of monorail feeders and a light rail system will start on the completion of a comprehensive program and budget for system operation.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThis project will construct a monorail feeder and light rail system as a part of Bangkok's interconnected mass transit system. This includes construction of the following:\n\u2022\tMonorail - Gray Line: Phase 1) Watcharaphon to Thonglor, 16.25 km, 15 stations. Phase 2) Phra Khanong to Rama 3, 12.17 km, 14 stations. Phase 3) Rama 3 to Tha Phra, 11.14 km, 9 stations.\n\u2022\tMonorail - BMA 2 (Din Daeng Area) to Yothee, 6 km, 6 sky- stations and 1 subway station interconnector\n\u2022\tRail Transit System, 4 km, along the road from Bang Wa to Taling Chan.\n\u2022\tLight rail - Bang Na to Suvarnabhumi Airport\nThe Traffic and Transportation Department in BMA will be in charge of\ninfrastructure development, transit system and control and monitoring of the system, drawing on input from specialist consultants.\nTIMELINE:\n8 years for completion of light rail construction, 3 years for completion of Phase 1 monorail\n2.1.3\tEXPANSION OF THE WATER TRANSPORT NETWORK\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nTraffic and Transportation Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis will be a faster and cheaper option for daily commuters along the Phasi Charoen Canal route.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of Bangkok.\nBangkok currently has water based transport to various city locations. However,\nthe water transport network is not well linked with land transport networks.\nIntegration of water based transport with the road and rail network will encourage city dwellers to use waterways more frequently.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project will pilot two new ferry services over the course of a year. The new\nservice will include a 11.5 km route in Phasi Charoen Canal, between Phasi Charoen, Watergate Pier and Phetkasem 69. Phetkasem 69 pier will connect to the Bangkok Mass Transit System (BTS). A route will also go from klong Padung Krung Kasem to Hua Lum Pong (Central Station). This initiative will test the benefits of encouraging more people to use waterways, which are currently underutilized, cheaper, and less time consuming than some other modes of transport. Ferries will operate on these routes daily from 06:00 to 09:00am and 04:00 to 07.30pm.\nUse of the service will be monitored carefully, including numbers of passengers and levels of satisfaction with the service. Near the end of the trial period the success of this new service will be evaluated and recommendations made on its future,\nincluding approaches for increasing the potential for more Bangkok residents to\nbenefit from increased use of water-based transport\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\n2.2\tIMPROVING TRAFFIC FLOW IN THE CITY\nGIVEN THAT BANGKOKIANS STILL PREDOMINATELY TRAVEL BY ROAD, TRAFFIC CONGESTION, ROAD CONDITIONS AND DRIVER BEHAVIOUR IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN MANY PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES. THIS INITIATIVE SEEKS TO IMPROVE TRAFFIC FLOW THROUGH A RANGE OF INTERVENTIONS.\n2.2.1\tINTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nTraffic and Transportation\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis initiative will optimize traffic\nmanagement and help to reduce\ncongestion in the city. Reduction in transit times will encourage a more active lifestyle, providing residents with greater opportunities for\nrecreation and economic growth.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents and businesses.\nTraffic management is a significant challenge for Bangkok - one for which cities around the world are increasingly turning to innovative technological solutions.\nThe city requires a comprehensive traffic management system that can optimise traffic movement and reduce congestion. This project will establish an integrated information system for interactive traffic management in Bangkok.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative will drive establishment of an interactive information system to facilitate traffic flow monitoring, traffic volume control, signal management and the design of a traffic movement plan.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\n2.2.2\tREDUCING TRAFFIC CONGESTION AROUND SCHOOLS - PILOT STUDY OF SAMSEN ROAD\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nTraffic and Transportation\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nMultiple and well-connected mass transportation networks will improve residents' mobility by providing safe, fast and convenient daily commuting. Shorter commute times will increase productivity and economic efficiency and contribute to broader economic growth. Reducing traffic congestion in school areas will also increase the health and wellbeing of children by reducing exposure to emissions, and reducing risk of traffic accidents.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of Bangkok.\nSamsen Road is a secondary road that links the important areas of Phra Nakhon, Dusit, and Bang Sue Districts. It also accepts traffic from the main road that connects travel between the east and west sides of Bangkok, and therefore is a critical thoroughfare for many residents and businesses. Currently, traffic conditions are particularly bad, with an average of up to 18,000 vehicles per hour during peak hours. This is exacerbated by the parking of private cars waiting to pick up students from schools . This causes congestion of nearby roads on which schools are located, massive traffic delays and concentrates pollution in these school areas. This initiative will study the impacts of traffic congestion in and around Samsen Road and determine approaches to reduce traffic congestion, including through improving the public transportation system especially for students.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative will be implemented based on a detailed study of traffic volumes during peak and off peak hours, land use compatibility and road capacity. A development plan will be prepared for reducing traffic congestion and improving road safety.\nTIMELINE:\n6 months\n2.2.3\tSTUDY OF INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF ROAD NETWORK AND DEVELOPMENT OF A MASTER PLAN\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nPublic Works Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nImproving traffic flow in the city\nthrough a diverse range of policies\nand technologies will increase\neconomic productivity and better\nensure the safety and ease of\nmovement of residents. Reduction in transit times will encourage a more active lifestyle, providing residents with greater opportunities for\nrecreation.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents who commute through\n\u201cSuper Block Areas\u201d and communities in these areas.\nA number of enclosed areas or a so-called \u2018Super Block Areas' in central Bangkok face severe traffic congestion. The Super Blocks are enclosed space associated with commercial areas, business centres, residential areas or education institutes, which connect to few or far-away main roads and have insufficient \u2018distributing roads' inside to allow traffic flow. Some of the available distributing roads are\nnarrow lanes, discontinuous, with no linkages to other routes. Due to the number\nof occupants of super blocks, traffic problems in these area are of serious concern, and cause cascading traffic jams in adjacent main roads. This initiative aims to solve traffic problems in Super Block Areas through better understanding the integrated road network, and improving traffic regulations.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative will explore feasible options to improve road networks in Super Block Areas in Bangkok. Studies will be conducted on different aspects regarding Super Block Areas and traffic congestion, causes and solutions, possible expansions and improving existing road conditions, traffic regulations and other safety measures to enhance road connectivity, mobility and safety. Land use options such as\nland development to downsize Super Block areas and strategic decisions on\ntraffic movements in the selected areas, such as linkages to main roads, creating\nemergency routes for prompt access and road lighting will also be considered. The result will be used for formulation of Transportation Master Plan in Super Block Areas.\nTIMELINE:\n1 Year\n2.2.4\tFEASIBILITY STUDY FOR DRIVING CREDIT MEASURES AND TAXES\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nTraffic and Transportation\nDepartment, BMA, National Institute of Development Administration\n(NIDA)\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe outcome of the study will guide a potential new tax policy as a measure to reduce the use of private cars and increase the proportion of passengers using public transport. Reduction in the use of private vehicles will have a number of benefits including improving air quality in the city, reducing carbon emissions and a healthier lifestyle for Bangkokians.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents and businesses.\nAround the world, various Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies\nhave proven to be effective in reducing demand for road travel, particularly in single-occupant vehicles. Some of these measures entail taxes for private car\nusers to fund public costs such as traffic management, investment in road or public transporation system construction, and traffic pollution control. Some\ninvolve financial deterrents to limit or restrict the use of private cars in certain areas or routes, reducing traffic congestion in particular places at peak times. BMA will explore various TDM options for better mobility management, encouraging communities to use public transport rather than private vehicles.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nA feasibility study will be conducted on TDM focusing on Driving Credit Measures to limit the use of personal vehicles and Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) - a tax-based measure which would impose an additional financial burden on owners of personal cars registered in Bangkok.\nThe study will also review road rules, laws, guidelines and case studies on the application of the TDM measures in other major cities. It will also develop a better understanding of the Bangkok-specific context in relation to TDM, including\nbehaviours of private car users, mode of mobility, traffic volumes, mobility time and cost, and car user opinions. The outcomes of the study will support decisions on whether these TDM measures are appropriate, practical and viable for Bangkok.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\n2.3\tREDUCING ROAD RELATED DEATHS THROUGH\nINFLUENCING DRIVER BEHAVIOUR AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES\nAS ROAD TRANSPORT REMAINS THE DOMINANT MODE OF TRANSIT FOR RESIDENTS, INCREASING ROAD SAFETY\nTHROUGH INFLUENCING DRIVER BEHAVIOUR AND COMMUNICATION IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF FOCUS. THIS\nINITIATIVE HAS THREE SUB-PROJECTS APPROACHING THIS ISSUE FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF DRIVER BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, TESTING DRIVERLESS VEHICLES, AND ROAD SAFETY AUDITING.\n2.3.1\tROAD SAFETY AUDIT\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nPublic Works Department and Local District Offices, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nImproving the physical condition of\nroads will reduce the risk of accidents and contribute to a safer driving environment. Fewer accidents will help alleviate traffic congestion.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBMA staff, and road users in Bangkok.\nBMA is responsible for constructing and monitoring public infrastructure such as\nroads and bridges in Bangkok. It is important to maintain road safety standards\nduring infrastructure development and monitoring. This initiative intends to\ndisseminate information about safety standards relating to the physical condition of roads. This will be supplemented through the training of staff in auditing procedures. This will minimize road accidents inside the city and in adjoining areas that arise from poor road conditions.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative will be implemented through a training workshop with staff at the\nPublic Works Department of BMA. On the job training and case studies will be\nprovided to educate staff on risks arising from the physical condition of roads and how these risks may be mitigated.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\n2.3.2\tDRIVER BEHAVIOUR CHANGE CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE ROAD ACCIDENTS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nTraffic and Transportation\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nRoad users will be educated on traffic regulations and safe driving to reduce number of accident and casualties. Creating more awareness of road safety will encourage residents to take greater responsibility for their own safety and that of their community.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of Bangkok.\nThe use of private vehicles in the city is increasing, with more than half of the city's residents using a personal vehicle as their primary or sole mode of transport. At the same time, Thailand is ranked second in the world with regard to the number of traffic fatalities, with 44 deaths per 100,000 people (5.1 per cent of Thailand's overall deaths) [13]. This project aims to raise awareness, particularly among youth, about traffic regulations and road safety, to reduce road accidents. One component of enforcing driving safety standards is to ensure drivers in the highest risk category, youth, are aware of applicable regulations and road safety measures.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative will be implemented in support of the National Government's Policy (2011-2020) \u201cDecade of Road Safety\u201d. BMA will first investigate global best practices in addressing road deaths, and use this to develop messaging and delivery modes which will be most likely to change behaviour. Campaigns for building awareness and vigilance on road safety will be developed and rolled out across the city. These will use both electronic and print media.\nTIMELINE:\n300 days (2017)\n2.3.3\tMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRIVERLESS VEHICLES\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nBMA, Research Institutes and Automobile Companies\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nBenefits range from environmental outcomes such as better air quality and reduced carbon emissions, to safer roads, less traffic congestion and improved mobility for vulnerable groups such as the disabled or elderly.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents and the car manufacturing industry.\nDriverless vehicles have significant potential to reduce traffic congestion and accidents in the city. Additionally, a driverless car can act as private and public transport, in that it can make multiple, consecutive trips, potentially reducing the number of cars on the road and reducing requirements for parking in urban areas. As a major car manufacturing hub, Bangkok is in a unique position to participate in the development and testing of these vehicles, giving our city an opportunity to benefit economically, as well as in terms of improved liveability.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe initiative will be implemented through a Public Private Partnership (PPP), involving private automobile companies, research institutes from home and abroad and BMA. The PPP approach will be designed with strong technology transfer and capacity building provisions.\nTIMELINE:\n6 months\nGOAL 3:\nENVIRONMENTALLY\nFRIENDLY\nURBANIZATION\nEnvironmental sustainability is an increasingly important priority for Bangkok. As a major hub of industry, population and economic growth, Bangkok seeks to be a world leader among other Asian cities that have experienced rapid and unplanned growth, bringing with it the associated transport, waste management and land use challenges that impact on the health and wellbeing of its citizens. BMA's program to lower the city's carbon footprint and lessen the effects of carbon emissions consists of the following four initiatives:\n\u2022 Green growth: supporting environmentally friendly growth and sustainable waste management\n\u2022 Encouraging low-carbon transport\n\u2022 Growing green space\nImproving air quality management and communication.\n3.1\tGREEN GROWTH: SUPPORTING ENVIRONMENTALLY\nFRIENDLY GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE WASTE\nMANAGEMENT\nTHESE TWO PROJECTS WILL SUPPORT BETTER RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL OF RUBBISH AND WASTEWATER. BY PROMOTING COMMUNITY RECYCLING AND WASTE COLLECTION, AND THROUGH TURNING SOLID WASTE INTO USABLE ENERGY, LESS FOSSIL FUEL WILL BE CONSUMED AND THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF WASTE WILL BE REDUCED.\n3.1.1\tSUSTAINABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nEnvironment Department, and Drainage and Sewerage Department,\nBMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe project will reduce solid waste disposal and treatment costs, reduce Gree House Gas emissions, devise suitable means and approaches for charging for waste and wastewater treatment, and improve quality of life for Bangkok residents.\nBangkok produces 22 per cent of the whole nation's wastewater and yet can treat only 46 per cent of its wastewater daily. While part of the solution to this will be increasing capacity to process and treat Bangkok's waste, the greatest and most cost-efficient gains can be made through reducing waste generation. This project has been developed to support sustainable waste and wastewater management to correlate with green growth development and the 20 year direction of the city development plan.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe project will encourage waste reduction in communities and businesses according to the reduce, reuse and recycle hierarchy, and study suitable means of charging for waste management and wastewater treatment. It will also run an awards program to reward communities and businesses for strong performance in waste and wastewater management.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nTIMELINE:\nBangkok residents at the community\t3 years\nlevel, through income generation from waste recycling and at the city level through sustainable growth and effective waste management.\n3.1.2\tDEVELOPMENT OF WASTE-TO-ENERGY\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nEnvironment Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nWaste-to-energy plants can reduce\nwaste volume to be disposed to\nlandfill, while also reducing demands on fossil fuels, as well as Green House Gas emissions to the environment\nassociated with landfills. These plants will also provide another source of employment for people of varying skill levels.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBMA, Bangkok residents, the natural environment.\nProducing 9,900 tons of solid waste per day, or 22 per cent of total waste in the\ncountry, Bangkok is struggling to find suitable landfill areas for waste treatment.\nWaste-to-Energy technologies can generate electricity by either incineration which is direct combustion or without direction combustion through thermal technology or non-thermal technology. This contributes to reducing waste volumes to landfill and provides a fossil fuel free source of electricity.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe project will construct a waste-to-energy plant which can treat 600 tons of\nsolid waste per day of waste, and community plants with a total capacity of 600\ntons per day.\nThe development ot this project will include an engagement process that includes meaningful community input into selecting sites for the plant that maximises the potential for environmental, social and economic benefits.\nTIMELINE:\nLong-term (20 years)\n3.2\tENCOURAGING LOW CARBON TRANSPORT\nACCESS TO, AND USE OF, LOW CARBON TRANSPORT OPTIONS IN BANGKOK WILL BE INCREASED BY THESE TWO PROJECTS. BY PROMOTING EXISTING EMISSION-FREE TRANSPORT AND LOOKING INTO BUILDING NEW BICYCLE PATHWAYS ACROSS THE CITY, CAR USE WOULD BE REDUCED AND COMMUTERS WILL ENJOY SAFER JOURNEYS WITH LESS TRAFFIC.\n3.2.1\tENCOURAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TRANSPORTATION\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nEnvironment Department, and Traffic and Transportation Department of BMA, Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning, and Department of Land transport of Ministry of Transport\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe use of private vehicles, traffic congestion, and air pollution will be decreased which could improve the health and quality of lives of Bangkok citizens.\nAir pollution in Bangkok has been increasing - today it exceeds air quality\nstandards on most days, primarily due to the large quantity of vehicles using fossil fuels. This project aims to promote alternative ways of travel to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion in Bangkok.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nBMA will work with contracted consulting firms to improve the public's awareness\nof the use of public transport and other means of environmentally friendly travel modes such as electric vehicles, bicycles and walking. Monitoring and evaluation, particularly of air quality will be done periodically to assess the impacts of the project.\nTIMELINE:\nShort-term 5 years (2018-2022);\nBENEFICIARIES:\nPeople who live, work and study in Bangkok.\n3.2.2\tSTUDY ON ENHANCING CYCLING PATHWAYS AND FACILITIES\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nGraduate School of Environmental\nDevelopment Administration,\nNational Institute of Development\nAdministration, BMA, and relevant\npartners\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis project will result in enhanced\naccessibility to facilities and\ninfrastructure for many vulnerable\nresidents, promotion of local tourism, and pollution reduction along cycle paths. It will also enhance the city's cultural landscape.\nEffective cycling infrastructure will\nalso provide alternative mobility\noptions when disruption strikes road and\/or public transport networks.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents and tourists,\nespecially vulnerable residents who\ncannot afford a private vehicle.\nEncouraging residents to take up cycling can have multiple benefits for the city.\nCycling is a healthy, low impact form of exercise that can be enjoyed by all ages. In addition to health benefits, it can contribute to improved mobility for Bangkok residents, facilitating quicker, short commutes, connecting transportation options. Increased uptake of cycling can also reduce traffic congestion and improve air\nquality through reducing emissions from vehicles. Whilst Bangkok currently has\nsome cycling pathways, these are desperate and not well connected. In some\nplaces they may also be unsafe, reducing their widespread appeal and use.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe study will analyse and make recommendations in relation to three areas:\n\u2022 Location of cycling pathways and physical facilities suitable for elderly persons, tourists, and communities in Bangkok.\n\u2022 Providing an enabling environment for cycling focusing on air quality, connection of cycling paths, public transport and potential communities\/ tourism sites, layout and maps of accommodating facilities and landmarks.\n\u2022 Enhancing local business facilities and capacities along cycling pathways.\nTIMELINE:\n3-5 years\n3.2.3\tIMPROVING AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nEnvironment Department, 50\nBangkok district offices of BMA,\nand Pollution Control Department,\nMinistry of Natural Resources and\nEnvironment\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nA Bangkok air pollution inventory\nand database will assist in solving\nair pollution problems. This can be\nexpected to result in a decline in\nrespiratory diseases and increased\nhealth and quality of life for Bangkok residents.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nThe residents of Bangkok who live,\nwork or study in the city.\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) is the international standard to assess air quality on a\ndaily basis. In Thailand, the AQI parameters and standards have been identified by the Pollution Control Department and have been applied throughout the country. However due to unique characteristics of air quality in a mega-city like Bangkok, which is different from other parts of the country, AQI parameters and standards for Bangkok should be developed specifically for the city to ensure more effective air quality management.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe project will develop an air emission inventory for Bangkok. The inventory\nwill be used to determine and predict air pollution sources in Bangkok, as well as\ndeveloping an accurate and reliable database (GIS-based) to support effective\nsolutions to air pollution problems. The results from the Bangkok index will be used to raise awareness, and contribute to solving air pollution, health and sanitation problems in the city.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year (2017-2018)\n3.3\tGROWING GREEN SPACE\nBANGKOK'S RAPID GROWTH FROM RURAL LAND TO A BUSTLING MEGA-CITY HAS MEANT REDUCING GREEN\nSPACES AND TREES, TO THE DETRIMENT OF ITS CITIZENS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE THREE PROJECTS AIM TO PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF PARKS, RECREATION GROUNDS AND OTHER URBAN GREEN AREAS, IN PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY OWNED SPACES.\n3.3.1\tDEVELOPING NEW RECREATIONAL PARKS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nOffice of Public Park, Environment Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe initiative provides green\nrecreation areas for Bangkok\nresidents for improved quality of life and better environmental outcomes. The database will be used by decision makers to plan for more green spaces in the future.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents.\nGreen space has a tremendous number of positive effects for a city. These range from ecosystem services like natural temperature regulation and reduction of surface water runoff, to psychological benefits and providing spaces for Bangkok residents to be active or relax.\nBMA's commitment to increase green space by 500,000 acres over the next 5\nyears is one of its most important policies. This project aims to construct parks\nfully equipped with standard facilities and develop a database of green areas in\nBangkok for future planning.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe project will see the construction of four new recreational parks to increase\nurban green space in Bangkok including:\n\u2022 Golden Jubilee Park to celebrate the 7th Auspicious Ceremony in Bang Bon (250 hectares)\n\u2022 Community park on the land at Phetkasem Soi 69, Bang Kae (70 acres)\n\u2022 Community park under the responsibility of Land Development Department (37 acres)\n\u2022 Community park at Soi Phrachaluamjai 7, Bueng Lum Pai, Minburi (78 acres).\nPlanning and development of these parks will embody the quality of inclusiveness by providing Bangkok residents with an opportunity to share their hopes and expectations for these new public spaces. The spaces will also be designed to maximise co-benefits, such as floodwater retention during extreme rainfall events, and to act as a safe gathering place in the event of a major shock such as a seismic disturbance.\nThe project will also survey and generate a database of green spaces in Bangkok\nTIMELINE:\n2012-2017 (on-going)\n3.3.2\tPROMOTE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND MEASURES TO SUSTAINABLY INCREASE GREEN SPACE\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nEnvironment Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nIncreasing the amount of green space on private land will result in better environmental conditions in Bangkok. The initiative will also increase public awareness of sustainable green space, and guide possible measures for the government to support green space policy.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents.\nPlanting trees is a simple and sustainable solution to reduce carbon emissions, adapt Bangkok to the effects of climate change, and reduce air pollution and its health effects on residents. Public engagement to increase green spaces on privately owned land is a low cost and sustainable way of improving the city's environment.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project includes awareness-raising and training for government officials, community leaders and members of the community to promote the importance of green spaces, and will select a pilot community to develop a community-based green area. The project also includes research on practical measures to support sustainable green space development, considering examples from across Thailand and globally, drawing on knowledge within the 100RC network.\nTIMELINE:\n3 years (2017 - 2020)\n3.3.3\tDEVELOPMENT OF GREEN SPACE AND RIVERSIDE PROMENADE ALONG THE BANKS FOR THE CHAO PHRAYA RIVER\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nDepartment of Public Works BMA,\nNational Government\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe promenade will restore the\npublic's access to the river bank while also providing open green space and transport connectivity between major business districts. The promenade\nwill be wheelchair accessible and\nprovide recreational opportunities for the young, elderly and disabled. The promenade will also provide a new attraction for the city which will help boost trade and incomes for local\nresidents.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents and visitors.\nThe Chao Phraya River runs through the centre of Bangkok for over 70 kilometres. Public access to the riverbank is limited to transportation, public buildings, hotels and a limited number of parks. This project aims to restore Bangkok's riverside area for public use and is strongly backed by residents and land owners.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nA five metre wide promenade will be developed along 1.2 km of the Chao Phraya\nRiver bank and will feature a walkway, cycling path and open green space for\npublic recreational use. The cycling path will stretch from Rama 7 Bridge to Phra\nPen Klao Bridge, on both sides of the river. The promenade will be strategically\nsituated to connect central business districts and serve as a major hub for land\nand water transport. While some of the area to be converted is government\nowned, some will be acquired from local land owners. These land owners will be\ncompensated for the contribution of their land.\nTIMELINE:\n3 years\nSTRATEGIC ACTION AREA\n2: REDUCING RISK AND\nINCREASING ADAPTATION\nGOAL 4: IMPROVING RESILIENCE TO FLOODS\nGOAL 5: INCREASING PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY-DRIVEN ACTION ON AWARENESS, PREPAREDNESS AND ADAPTATION\nGOAL 6: STRONGER INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND REGULATION\nGOAL 4: IMPROVING RESILIENCE TO FLOODS\nAs a flood-prone city facing a changing climate, we\nmust look at different approaches for \u2018living with water'. These approaches represent a more integrated and holistic way to manage different city water systems, rather than solely depending on flood protection via hard infrastructure.\nInitiatives to deliver this goal will focus on conservation and development of the city's blue and green infrastructure, primarily by improved catchment management, open space, and green areas to maximize natural infrastructure for water management. These actions will be underpinned by community participation for integrated socio-economic, environmental and flood protection benefits. This will be combined with specific flood defence actions such as upgrading drainage and trialling the use of a flood resilience index in an urban area.\nThis goal is supported by the following three initiatives:\n\u2022\tCatchment management strategy and vision for the Chao Phraya Basin\n\u2022\tCommunity water resource management programs\nUrban flood defences.\n4.1\tCATCHMENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND VISION FOR THE CHAO PHRAYA BASIN\nWITH A CHANGING CLIMATE AND INCREASING URBAN DEVELOPMENT, CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT IN THE CHAO\nPHRAYA BASIN WILL ONLY BECOME MORE COMPLEX AND IMPORTANT. GIVEN THIS, IT IS A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE CITY TO CONSIDER ITS VISION FOR LIVING WITH WATER IN THE FUTURE. COMPRISED OF THREE SUB-PROJECTS, THIS INITIATIVE WILL HELP TO PROVIDE A CLEAR NARRATIVE ON HOW BANGKOK, AND CITIES UP-STREAM,\nWILL APPROACH HOLISTIC CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AND SET A FUTURE DIRECTION AND OBJECTIVES FOR\nINNOVATIVE WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE CITY. THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE SET OUT IN CLEAR TERMS AND\nWILL REQUIRE COOPERATION ACROSS THE CITY ON A NEW APPROACH, NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE CITY FROM FLOODING, BUT TO HARNESS WATER IN THE CITY FOR LIFE AND LIVEABILITY\n4.1.1\tSTUDY OF LOWER CHAO PHRAYA BASIN AND SETTING VISION FOR WATER MANAGEMENT IN BANGKOK\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nBMA, Royal Irrigation Department,\nMinistry of Agriculture and\nCooperatives, The National Water\nResources Board,\nDeltares and other up-stream city\noffices.\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis study will help to understand\nthe current gaps and effective water management initiatives required in the future. This initiative will bring together diverse stakeholders to\ntake a holistic approach to water\nmanagement in the city, moving\nBangkok beyond flood protection to look at how it will live with water now and into the future.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nThis study will help to understand\nthe current gaps and effective water management initiatives required in the future. This initiative will bring together diverse stakeholders to\ntake a holistic approach to water\nmanagement in the city, moving\nBangkok and the upstream cities\nbeyond flood protection to look at\nhow these will live with water now\nand into the future.\nFor comprehensive flood management, it is necessary to understand the prevailing conditions in the lower Chao Phraya Basin. The Basin receives a large amount of water from the northern part of the country, which must pass through Bangkok before draining into the Gulf of Thailand.\nThis action will help to establish a clear understanding of this process and explore how to utilize water passing through the Basin, both during the rainy season and the dry period. The areas to be covered under this initiative include the adjoining areas of Tah Cheen, Bang Phra Kong and Chao Phraya River.\nFollowing this study, the city will determine objectives for water management in\nthe near future. This will be set out as a clear vision, for agreement by stakeholders across the city. This vision will not only consider flood protection, but will embody a holistic approach to water in the city.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe activity will involve intensive situational analysis based on infrastructure,\nland use and land elevation and the climatic and socio-economic conditions of\nthe selected areas. It will bring together stakeholders to set objectives for water\nmanagement in the city and clearly set out these objectives for broad agreement across agencies responsible for water management, including those for flood protection and drainage, in Bangkok.\nTIMELINE:\n2 years\n4.1.2\tDEVELOPMENT OF A FLOOD HAZARD MAP FOR MANAGEMENT AND TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC ON PREPARATION FOR FLOOD EVENTS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nDrainage and Sewerage, Department of BMA, Swisse Re\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nWill contribute to more effective\nflood management with particular\nattention to drainage system\nimprovement, land use decisions,\npublic awareness campaign\nand decision support for flood\nmanagement.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nPublic and private organizations,\nbusiness, and Bangkok residents.\nBangkok has physically grown in different directions over the decades and many\nof its settlements are in low lying areas. Being located on the basin of River Chao Phraya, floods are a common phenomenon for the city; however, vulnerable residents remain inadequately prepared for flood events. This project will develop a flood hazard and risk assessment for the city to help residents better understand flood risk and assist in flood preparedness. At the same time, it will also be useful for city authorities in identifying flood preparedness initiatives and decisions.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project will conduct a comprehensive flood risk assessment which will\nconsider historical flood events, exposure, vulnerability and socio-economic\naspects. Based on the outcomes of this study an emergency response plan and\nspatial contingency plan will be prepared both at city and community levels.\nTIMELINE:\n1-3 years\n4.1.3\tENHANCE EFFECTIVENESS OF WEATHER AND RAINFALL FORECASTS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nDrainage and Sewerage Department of BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nWill improve the accuracy of\npredictions about the time, location and volume of rainfall or water in the city for more effective management of flooding in the city. This will\nminimise disruption to the city and\ncontribute to reduced loss of life, less damage to property and economic stability.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents and businesses.\nBangkok experiences seasonal flooding due to rainfall events both upstream and\nwithin the City. Many areas are often flooded from sudden rain, causing disruption to residents' lives and amplifying existing stresses, such as traffic congestion. Impermeable surfaces in the built environment. Uncertain climate change impacts further add to the unpredictability of flood events in the city. An improved weather forecasting system would assist with more effective flood preparedness in the short and long term.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project will implement weather forecasting staff capacity building and\ntraining, along with investment in updates to forecasting technology. In the\nmedium-term, the aim is to provide city residents with access to more accurate\nand easy-to-understand weather information that can be used to inform day-to-\nday decision making.\nTIMELINE:\n1-2 years\n4.2\tCOMMUNITY WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nICONIC AND CHARMING WATERWAYS AND CANALS (\u2018KLONGS') AROUND THE CITY - ONCE CORNERSTONES OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE OF BANGKOK - ARE NOW SERIOUSLY DETERIORATED DUE TO OVERUSE AND POLLUTION. WHILE THESE RIVERS AND KLONGS CAN PLAY IMPORTANT AND DIVERSE ROLES IN MODERN BANGKOK, ACCUMULATED STRESSES, INCLUDING POOR WASTE MANAGEMENT AND LACK OF PRIORITIZATION OF WATER RESOURCE CONSERVATION, HAS SEEN THESE WATERCOURSES DECLINE IN QUALITY AND AMENITY. THIS INITIATIVE HIGHLIGHTS THE CRITICAL CONTRIBUTION THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS IN WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND WATERWAYS RESTORATION. THROUGH TWO SUB-PROJECTS, IT WILL ENGAGE COMMUNITIES AS A KEY AGENT FOR WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT WHILE ALSO PROMOTING COMMUNITY ADAPTATION TO A CHANGING CLIMATE AND URBANIZATION, REDUCE WASTE AND IMPROVE WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD PROTECTION.\n4.2.1\tCOMMUNITY WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nHydro and Agro Informatics Institute, BMA, Community\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe initiative will ensure an increase in the amount of fresh water supply for agriculture, improved water quality in the community and ensure continuation of tourist attractions.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nThe community along Klong Lat Ma Yom, Klong Lum Phra Dong, and Klong Bang Prom,Taling Chan District, Bangkok\nTaling Chan is considered to be the only agricultural-based tourism area in Bangkok. It is the home of local herb, flower and vegetable gardens, as well as floating markets (Klong Lat Ma Yom) that host more than 3,000 tourists each day.\nThe community have restored the canal and promoted it as a tourism destination with the help of Phothisanpittayakorn school, Taling Chan district Office and Utokapat Foundation under the Royal Patronage of H.M. the King. However, inadequate water in the canal (Lum Phra Dong) and the branches are placing this area under stress. The community then has a plan to expand the restoration of Klong Lam Phra Dong and Klong Bang Prom, as well as improving waste management in Klong Lat Ma Yom to further improve water quality.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe activity will involve intensive situational analysis based on infrastructure,\nland use and land elevation and the climatic and socio-economic conditions of the selected areas. It will bring together stakeholders to set objectives for water management in the city and clearly set out these objectives for broad agreement across agencies responsible for water management, including flood protection and drainage, in Bangkok.\nTIMELINE:\n2 years\n4.2.2\tWATER-SENSITIVE MARKETPLACE\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nEnvironment Department, Drainage and Sewerage Department and Local District Offices of BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nWill help to reduce the waste and\nfood scraps from Marketplaces to\nimprove drainage and enhance water quality.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nCity dwellers particularly the Canal\nSide Traders and consumers.\nMarketplaces generate high volumes of general and food waste daily, much of\nwhich flows into nearby watercourses, interrupting drainage and significantly\ndecreasing water quality. In many markets, wastewater from residential and\ncommercial areas is connected to the canal system, further degrading water\nquality and polluting the surrounding environment. This project will focus on waste and wastewater management from marketplaces to improve water quality and drainage.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThis project will be implemented through a community-based approach, engaging directly with marketplaces and their vendors to better understand barriers to sustainable waste management. At the outset, a range of different solutions will be considered, ranging from awareness campaigns centred on waste and wastewater disposal, to introducing new wastewater collection and treatment systems, along with accompanying training in how to use these systems effectively. The project will also draw on expertise from the 100RC network on innovative models for funding new initiatives where increased cost may be a major barrier to uptake.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\n4.2.3\tMANAGEMENT OF WASTE COLLECTION FOR CANAL COMMUNITIES\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nEnvironment Department, Local\nDistrict Offices, and Drainage and\nSewerage Department of BMA.\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe volume of garbage in the canals from the communities will be reduced to facilitate effective navigation and drainage, and improve water quality and amenity for the community. It will also increase the attractiveness of the area for tourism.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nThe residents of Bangkok, in\nparticular canal side residents.\nOnce known as the Venice of the East, the city of Bangkok still has a number of\ncanals that are used for transportation and drainage. However, the canals often\nhave reduced functionality due to excessive garbage dumping particularly by the\ncommunities residing by the canals. This project intends to review the management of waste collection in community areas along the canals, reducing the amount of garbage in the canals and ensuring the proper navigation and drainage capacity of the canals is restored.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nA community-based approach will be adopted to develop and encourage the use\nof a waste management system across the communities living alongside selected\ncanals. A number of actions including awareness building on waste dumping, and\nimprovement of waste facilities will be implemented as part of this project.\nTIMELINE:\n2 years\n4.3\tURBAN FLOOD DEFENCES\nBANGKOK'S HIGH VULNERABILITY TO FLOODING REQUIRES MULTIPLE MEASURES TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE CITY'S FLOOD RESILIENCE. IN ADDITION TO CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AND ENGAGING COMMUNITY ACTIONS FOR WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, INNOVATIVE, VIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE OPTIONS FOR FLOOD DEFENCES\nMUST BE EXPLORED. CONSISTING OF SEVEN SUB-PROJECTS, THIS INITIATIVE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY BMA TO\nDEVELOP AN INTEGRATED AND ROBUST URBAN FLOOD DEFENCE SYSTEM, INCLUDING GREY, GREEN AND BLUE\nINFRASTRUCTURE RANGING FROM STRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS TO UPGRADING EXISTING DRAINAGE SYSTEMS,\nDEVELOPING NEW WATER STORAGE CAPACITY, AND EXPLORING THE CITY'S FLOOD RESILIENCE MONITORING.\n4.3.1\tREVISION OF DESIGN CRITERIA FOR DRAINAGE\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nDrainage and Sewerage Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nExisting design and functions of\ndrainage system will be better\nunderstood for effective design and implementation to meet current drainage demand and future\ncommunity needs.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nThe residents and businesses of\nBangkok.\nProviding drainage to support safe and healthy conditions in the face of rapid\ngrowth will mean significant investment in Bangkok's drainage systems. This new infrastructure will need to stand the test of time, meeting current needs as well as those of a larger population in a future affected by climate change. With this in mind, there is a pressing need to review and revise design standards for future drainage systems.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative will be implemented through detailed investigations into the\nexisting drainage system, coupled with other activities such as scenario planning to ensure that future demographic and technological developments are able to be considered. Additionally, flooding implications of different climate change\nscenarios will be better understood, and global leaders in urban drainage will be engaged with. This will inform future revisions in design standards.\nTIMELINE:\n6 months\n4.3.2\tPILOT STUDY ON DEVELOPING URBAN WATER RETENTION\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nDrainage and Sewerage, City\nPlanning, Public works and\nEducation Department of BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis initiative will increase green areas in the city, reduce flood intensity, and help to reduce urban heat island effects in built up areas.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of the City of Bangkok.\nAs a result of Bangkok's rapid expansion, the city has failed to retain adequate\nopen spaces for retaining rain water and now faces frequent flood and water\nlogging problems. This project aims to understand the current water retention\nareas and to identify possible locations for water retention in the city area. This\nproject will look at innovative ways to use green infrastructure to reduce flood\nintensity, while also generating other co-benefits such as areas for recreation.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nIn the built up areas within the city, potential areas like parks or play grounds will be identified for use as water retention areas. Identified areas will be properly designed with the provision of green areas. In the city periphery, agricultural lands suitable for water retention will be identified, with local landholders and residents consulted in this process.\nTIMELINE:\n1-2 years\n4.3.3\tIMPROVEMENT OF DRAINAGE SYSTEMS ALONG MAIN ROADS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nDrainage and Sewerage Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis study will help to understand\nthe current gaps and effective water management initiatives required in the future. This initiative will bring together diverse stakeholders to\ntake a holistic approach to water\nmanagement in the city, moving\nBangkok beyond flood protection to look at how it will live with water now and into the future.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents along the Chao Phraya\nBasin especially those living in the\nlower basin will benefit specifically\nfrom the study. All Bangkok residents will benefit from an integrated approach to water management in the city.\nProper drainage is important for a city like Bangkok where flooding is a common phenomenon. Many drainage pipes are too small for the volume of water they now receive and are irregularly maintained, creating water logging problems in many city areas. This project aims to improve drainage facilities in selected areas through infrastructure intervention.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nDrainage and sewage system improvement through the construction of new\ndrains and replacement of old pipes as required. This will be founded on a\ndetailed program of technical investigations to determine where investment\nwill be most effective. The project will also seek opportunities to maximise\nthe benefits of ground-disturbing works, such as co-location underground of\nelectrical wires where possible.\nTIMELINE:\n1-3 years\n4.3.4\tDEVELOPMENT OF DRAINAGE TUNNELS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nDrainage and Sewerage Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis initiative will ensure there are\nredundant facilities to increase\ndrainage capacity and reduce flood in city area and on road surface.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of the City of Bangkok.\nUnderground tunnels are currently being used to mitigate floods and waterlogging in Bangkok. These tunnels provide a shortcut to direct excessive water in the city area to the Chao Praya River for quick discharge. This helps reduce the time it takes for water to drain through connected drainage pipe systems and canal systems, significantly increasing efficiency of water drainage and reducing the risk of flooding. With the capacity to discharge high volumes of water, underground tunnels could also be used for canal water cleaning, by flushing water to wash away wastes and dilute pollution in canals.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project forms one part of a multifaceted approach to building redundancy into Bangkok's water management system. Apart from the existing seven underground tunnels currently operating, and two under construction, another four underground\ntunnels will be constructed - two in Bangkok's east, as well as two in the west.\nAs with the drainage systems project, this project will apply systems thinking to maximise the benefits that can be generated by this major infrastructure investment.\nTIMELINE:\n4 years\n4.3.5\tIMPROVEMENT OF MAJOR CANALS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nDrainage and Sewerage Department, BMA and Ministry of Social Development and Human Security\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis initiative will help reduce\nsettlement along water ways and\ncanals, resulting in increased drainage capacity and water flow during heavy rainfall or flood periods.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents of the City of Bangkok and settlements on the canals.\nEncroachment of canals or \u2018klongs' has been one of the major causes for water\nlogging in Bangkok. Squatter settlements along the waterways have severely\nobstructed water flow, making a number of canals unable to function at optimal\ndrainage capacity. The built up and densely populated environment of formal\nand informal settlements along canals has contributed to water pollution through\nhousehold waste water discharge further deteriorating water quality in city. This\nproblem is in part due to limited availability of affordable housing in urban areas\nthat drives those with low incomes to informal settlements along the canals.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project will take an integrated and holistic approach to the challenges\nfacing our city's canals, particularly in the areas of water regulation and waste\nmanagement.\nThis will include challenging processes and decisions, such as the possible\nrelocation of informal settlements to new areas; this will be managed in an inclusive way, providing these vulnerable communities a voice in the decision-making process. Other activities may include expanding canals and clearing to increase water drainage and storage capacity, and building reinforced concrete dams to regulate water flow of nine major canals in Bangkok Metropolitan Region - Klong Lad Prao, Klong Prem Prachakorn, Klong Bangkhen, Klong Bang Sue, Klong Pravet Burirom, Kong Phra Kanong, Klong Sam Wa, Kong Lad Buakhao and Kong Praya Rachmontri.\nLinking closely with the strategy goals around waste management, the project will also review the management of waste collection in remaining community areas along the canals, with a view to better understanding areas of need and how the needs of these communities can be more effectively met, thereby generating flow-on benefits for other Bangkok residents.\nTIMELINE:\n8 years\n4.3.6\tSTUDY OF THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING COMBINED UTILITY TUNNELS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nPublic Works Department, Drainage and Sewage Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe result of the study will be helpful\nto understand appropriate and cost-\neffectives structures, functions, and\nmanagement of utility tunnels hosting\nmultiple services' infrastructure\nsupporting the integrated and robust\nunderground space development of\nBangkok.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nThe residents and businesses of\nBangkok.\nMultiple service infrastructures located underground has made it difficult and costly to implement infrastructure upgrades, maintenance and replacement. Drainage pipes, water, electricity, and communication lines, as well as subway tunnels, cross each other in a disordered manner and sometimes obstruct each other, which can result in dangerous and structural malfunction. Additionally, the streets and pavements of Bangkok are constantly undergoing excavation, causing impacts on traffic, and producing noise, dust and air pollution. As there is an urgent need to upgrade Bangkok's aging sewerage system and drainage pipelines, it is crucial that Bangkok put in place an underground development plan for combined tunnels as a sustainable development solution.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative will be implemented based on in-depth research into the feasibility,\napplication, cost effectiveness, and comparative advantage of combined utility\ntunnels. The study will consider economic, financial and environmental aspects\nrelated to the tunnels, and also look into possible locations and prioritized areas\nfor developing combined utility tunnel infrastructures, service life, different designs and sizes. The study will produce: guidelines on how to enhance the capacity of underground utility systems, the costs and benefits of using a combined utilities tunnel, and a prototype for the utility tunnels.\nTIMELINE:\n1\tyear\nRETURNING PUBLIC\nSPACE TO THE PUBLIC - LINKING PEOPLE AND SPACES AND INCREASING ACCESS\nTO WATERWAYS\nKlong Ong Ang is one of the oldest remaining canals\nin Bangkok, dating back more than 200 years,\nconstructed by King Rama I. In fact, elderly resident\nWisuth Lertsuphanimitre points to a big tree by the\ncanal he claimed was planted during King Rama V's\nreign, signifying that the community may be more than a century old [15].\nOver the years, the area had become overrun with\nillegal stalls and garbage, leading to deteriorating\nwater quality. With the support of the local community, the waterway was recently restored by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. The restoration involved removing 500 illegal stalls (that once crowded the area and restricted pedestrian movement), landscape improvements, garbage removal and water treatment.\nThe area now has a two kilometre pedestrian walkway along the canal bank. The Bangkok Post reported that \u201caccording to the vendors, sales should be much better than before as the new walkway will be more spacious, orderly and will attract lots of people to come.\u201d [15].\nIt also noted that \u201cresidents living near and along the canal were completely behind the move to reclaiming public areas and improve the city's scenery.\u201d [15]\nResidents noted that the \u201cstalls at the old market were a serious fire risk,\u201d and that the restoration will \u201cbring back a sense of life and enjoyment to the area.\u201d[15]\n4.3.7\tFEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT OF FLOOD RESILIENCE INDEX (FRI) -SUKHUMVIT CASE STUDY\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nHydro and Agro Informatics Institute (Public Organization), Wattana District Office and Klong Teoy District Office, BMA, Drainage and Sewerage, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nAn understanding of flood resilience can help decision makers design appropriate interventions to reduce flood risk, increase economic\nproductivity and better ensure the\nsafety and movement of residents\nwith less disruption.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nWattana District Office and Klong\nTeoy District Office, Drainage and\nSewerage Department of BMA.\nThe Flood Resilience Index (FRI) helps cities to understand their vulnerability to\nflooding and other resilience characteristics in a specified area, informing decisions around how best to intervene and enhance resilience. This project will apply the FRI to assess and determine the resilience of Bangkok to flood, focusing on highly urbanized areas, with Sukumvit as pilot location. Applying the FRI will also allow for the comparison of Sukumvit's level of flood resilience to other cities in Europe and Asia, and inform BMA on sensitive areas and effective ways to take action.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nCovering over 24 square kilometers and comprising approximately 1,000 buildings, Sukumvit will be used as a case study for the application of FRI. This will include assessment at different spatial scales including macro (city or district), block, and micro (building), plus consideration of the five key elements of urban systems:\nphysical, natural, economic, social and institutional. The assessment will produce a GIS database and map, which will help in identifying the weak points of the study area and how these may be addressed.\nTIMELINE:\n2\tyears\nGOAL 5: INCREASE\nPUBLIC AND\nCOMMUNITY\nDRIVEN ACTION\nON AWARENESS,\nPREPAREDNESS AND\nADAPTATION\nApart from flood, Bangkok is exposed to a number of\ndifferent shocks and stresses which affect city residents. Many of these are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. It is important that our communities have\nthe knowledge and skills to enable them to cope with\nthese shocks and stresses. Additionally, community\nparticipation will complement all other BMA initiatives\non urban resilience. Effective communication systems\nthrough multiple channels and networks will improve\npromptness in emergency monitoring, alertness and\nresponsiveness. BMA along with the communities at risk will implement the following initiatives:\n\u2022 Community-based adaptation and disaster\npreparedness and communication;\nMaking better use of technology for public communication and disaster preparedness.\n5.1\tCOMMUNITY-BASED ADAPTATION AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND COMMUNICATION\nACTIVE ENGAGEMENT AND THE COLLECTIVE EFFORT OF ALL RESIDENTS WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR BANGKOK TO COPE WITH POTENTIAL THREATS AND ADAPT TO CHANGES.

The Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM)\nproject aims to raise awareness and build capacities of communities to be resilient from disasters and the changing climate, and promote economic and equitable adaptation.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe initiative will identify and establish a network of CBDRM leaders\/facilitators.\nThese people will build capacity on disaster and climate risk management\ndirectly with their communities, acting as a trusted advisor who can help develop community action plans and formalize community networks to build resilience. Additionally, CBDRM facilitators will help identify and mobilize shared resources (e.g. those with valuable skills that can be drawn upon by other community\nmembers in response to a shock event). Establishing facilitators for different\ncommunities will help ensure the solutions are right for each community, as well as being developed with the meaningful input of local people.\nThe project will also conduct feasibility studies on community-based solar roof\nenergy sources to provide communities with redundancy during a disaster event\nTIMELINE:\n3\tyears\n5.1.2\tCOMMUNITY FLOOD PREPAREDNESS COMMUNICATION\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nDrainage and Sewerage Department, Fire and Rescue Department, and Local District Offices of BMA, and Media and Press\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe public can access accurate information to create better understanding to cope with floods, minimize damages and losses, and reduce conflicts and confusion in times of disaster.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nThe residents of Bangkok and relevant organizations.\nAlthough Bangkok has continuously invested in flood prevention infrastructure, flood risk still remains high. Effective communication on flood preparedness to the public is thus deemed as important to minimize the impacts of flooding. This project aims to study flood impacts and measures, develop flood preparedness guidelines, create an effective public communication system, and build the capacity of government staff to communicate risks effectively.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe project will study possible impacts from floods to inform a set of flood preparedness guidelines for the public. This will be complemented by training for government officials to build effective communication skills, and the development of a communication system which is accurate, reliable and easy to access by the public.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nFire and Rescue Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe activities will raise awareness and create a culture of safety for younger\ngenerations - our future leaders. They will have the ability to survive and assist others in times of disaster and can also transfer safety knowledge to their families and wider communities. Schools in Bangkok will include safety aspects into school activities and curriculum.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nChildren and youth from primary to university education, educational institutions and communities in Bangkok.\nThe majority of young people in Bangkok lack an understanding on how to prepare and respond safely in times of emergency. The disaster safety youth education project will help raise awareness among youth to prevent, mitigate and reduce disaster risks while engaging parents through community participation. The action activity also aims to integrate disaster risk reduction into school activities and curriculum.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe project will conduct training on disaster safety for children and youth in selected schools and communities in Bangkok, including in some of the most vulnerable areas. The disaster education activity will focus on school and community evacuation and disaster survival through activities and games.\nAfter the initial year, the program will be evaluated and, if successful, opportunities for a broader roll-out investigated.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\n5.1.4\tDISASTER LEARNING CENTRE FOR EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE HAZARDS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nFire and Rescue Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe learning centre for earthquake\nand other hazards will be a\nknowledge-based resource that\nenhances the culture of safety among the general public.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents, students, and general\npublic.\nFire is a common hazard in the city, resulting in loss of property and lives.\nHowever, Bangkok has also been known to suffer the impacts of seismic force\nfrom neighbouring epicentres. Given that the city is situated on water-saturated, unconsolidated soil, collapsed structures triggered by earthquakes occurring in other regions are anticipated, though our ability to predict when and where these impacts will occur is limited. Risk awareness, precautionary measures and structural mitigation for earthquake-resistant construction are crucial to reducing catastrophic impacts and saving lives.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nBangkok's first Disaster Learning Centre will be designed and constructed at\nthe Fire and Rescue Department of BMA to provide learning opportunities on\nearthquake and fire hazards. The aim of this centre will be to engage with the\npublic on the dangers and possible harmful impacts of disasters, how to react\nand survive in unexpected circumstances and tips for safety.

Running a\ndesign competition also encourages innovation among Bangkok's technology sector.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nResidents, the technology sector.\nSmart phones are increasingly a part of everyday life. Today, they are most people's main outlet for connecting in a range of ways, including social media, traditional media and with one another via phone calls and messaging apps.\nThe opportunity exists to use smartphones to connect more effectively with the\npublic on disaster risks in real time.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project will trial multiple applications for mobile devices on flood\/disaster\npreparedness. It will include a competition for app developers to crowdsource the best ideas and innovative approaches from Bangkok residents.\nThe resultant apps will add redundancy in communication channels, improve\naccess to information, and increase understanding for how to deal with flood\/\ndisaster. The applications will also provide a channel for the public to request\nassistance. By sourcing innovative ideas from the public, there is also the potential for unexpected innovations and benefits.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year\nGOAL 6: STRONGER\nINSTITUTIONAL\nCAPACITY AND\nREGULATION\nStriving to make Bangkok safer to live for all, BMA,\nas the primary agency for city administration, must\nbe fully versed in disaster mitigation, preparedness,\nresponse and recovery. Complex urbanization and\nmulti-layer facilities and systems to run city functions\nmake urban disaster management a unique discipline\nthat requires a mix of expertise and practical skills to\naddress.\nConsidering the shocks Bangkok is likely to encounter,\nadvancing disaster management systems and practices are essential for city authorities to be able to address multiple shocks and related emergency situations in a more effective, comprehensive and harmonized manner, better protecting people and their assets as well as\nsocial stability and the wider economy.\nThe capacity and capabilities of BMA to be able to\nreduce risks in Bangkok need to be assured, especially their ability to carry out emergency operations which require practical knowledge and skills. Certain areas that the city should target for capacity development include search and rescue, emergency drills in a\ngiven scenario, coordination mechanisms, and\ncommunications. Bangkok will also seek to promote\ncollaboration and experience sharing with different\npartners within the country and in the region. The\nin-house capacity of BMA, equipped with modern\nequipment and necessary resources to effectively\nrespond to emergency situations will be strengthened\nthrough:\n\u2022 Capacity building for disaster risk reduction in BMA\n\u2022 Resources and infrastructure for better preparedness and response.\n6.1\tCAPACITY BUILDING FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN BMA\nAS A PIVOTAL AGENCY FOR BANGKOK DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT, BMA STAFF ARE A CRITICAL HUMAN\nRESOURCE IN CHARGE OF REDUCING RISKS AND DELIVERING EMERGENCY RESPONSE DURING CRITICAL TIMES.\nTHROUGH FOUR SUB-PROJECTS, THIS INITIATIVE AIMS TO SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCE BMA STAFF'S EXPERTISE AND SKILLS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS. THESE INITIATIVES WILL IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND TIMELINESS, PROMOTE INCLUSIVENESS AND EMBED RESILIENCE THINKING AND PRACTICE IN BMA STAFF. BANGKOK'S APPROACH TO THE STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS RECOGNISES THE PIVOTAL ROLE BMA PLAYS IN INSTITUTIONALIZING RESILIENCE IN THE CITY AND HAS THEREFORE HAD A STRONG FOCUS ON CAPACITY BUILDING. THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATION AND THE COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLUTIONS WITH A RANGE OF EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS, BMA EMBRACED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME RESILIENCE PRACTITIONERS AND TO APPROACH CHALLENGES WITH A RESILIENCE LENS.\n6.1.1\tDISASTER PREVENTION AND MITIGATION DRILLS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND PARTNERS:\nFire and Rescue Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe action empowers and leverage coherent efforts of different groups of stakeholders on preparedness, prevention, mitigation and emergency response in a more effective and integrated manner.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBMA disaster management and emergency response officials, communities, schools, businesses in Bangkok.\nWhile Bangkok has put in place Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Plans and other emergency operation plans, how and to what extent the plans could be run in an actual disaster situation remains uncertain. To translate these plans into action, it is necessary to ensure that all concerned are able to apply procedures, measures and steps in timely and effective manners, with role clarity, operating systems up and running, mechanisms in place for coordination and communication, and necessary resources pre-identified and readily available.\nGovernment officials, NGOs, volunteer groups, and others with roles in disaster\nmanagement will work together in joint exercises that will better equip them to\nunderstand and effectively apply their respective functions. These exercises will\nbuild trust and confidence, as well as helping to identify gaps and overlaps in\naccountabilities in a safe-to-fail environment. These exercises will be informed by\nextensive engagement with Bangkok citizens, residents, schools and business to\nunderstand how each organization's role responds to community needs.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nA series of training sessions, emergency exercises, and drills will be conducted\nby BMA to test functions and roles of assigned staff, volunteers and concerned\nagencies according to operational procedures and action plans, based on a\ncomprehensive review of staff skills and capacities.

The centre will offer hands-on practical training, learning and knowledge exchange on disaster management for interested persons, and local and international agencies.\nTIMELINE:\n4 years\n6.2.4\tESTABLISHMENT OF A BANGKOK COMMAND CENTRE\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nFire and Rescue Department, BMA\nin collaboration with various BMA\nDepartments.\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe establishment of a command\ncentre would assist agencies to\nrespond to disasters and incidents\nin a more integrated and cross-\ndisciplinary manner, ensuring a more effective response to residents.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok residents.\nEffective response to disaster events requires coordination across a wide range\nof Departments and Agencies responsible for a number of city actions. A\ncommand centre would enable BMA to have a single point of command for all\nemergency incidents and would bring Departments and Agencies together to\nshare information and cross silos. It would provide integrated monitoring of the\nenvironment, and facilitate effective facilitation across BMA.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis initiative will established an integrated command centre, where Departments and Agencies directly or indirectly involved in emergency response will join together to coordinate response to large emergency events.\nTIMELINE:\n2 years.\nGOAL 7: FACILITATING CITY AND\nCOMMUNITY-BASED\nECONOMY\nBangkok is currently experiencing slow economic\ngrowth due to several domestic and external factors\nincluding political instability, low investor confidence\nand private investment lagging behind public\ninvestment. However, Bangkok has a number of\navenues for growing its economy to the benefit of all\nBangkokians. BMA will proactively increase economic competitiveness and widen opportunity through:\n\u2022 Supporting economic resilience through:\n\u2022 Establishing Bangkok as a centre for trade and finance\nDeveloping and preserving agriculture in the city\n7.1\tSUPPORTING ECONOMIC RESILIENCE IN COMMUNITIES\nAND ENCOURAGING THE PRESERVATION OF AGRICULTURE IN THE CITY\nSOME COMMUNITIES IN BANGKOK FACE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES THAT CREATE OR INTENSIFY THEIR PRE-\nEXISTING VULNERABILITY. THIS INCLUDES INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS, AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES, WHOSE LAND IS BEING ENCROACHED UPON BY WIDESPREAD URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND THOSE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DISADVANTAGE. PATHWAYS TOWARDS A MORE RESILIENT BANGKOK WILL ENSURE INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT THAT WORKS WITH SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND HOW\nCURRENT APPROACHES ARE LEAVING THEM FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. BMA WILL WORK WITH TARGETED\nCOMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE WAYS TO BECOMING MORE SELF-RELIANT BY CREATING INCOME EARNING ACTIVITIES AND CAREER CHOICES, IMPROVING ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES AND PROMOTING THE RETENTION OF ARABLE LAND TO SECURE AGRICULTURAL LIVELIHOODS IN THE CITY. THESE WILL ALSO PROVIDE VALUABLE\nFLOOD MITIGATION AND RETENTION AREAS.\n7.1.1\tENHANCING RESILIENCE OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN BANGKOK THROUGH INTEGRATED FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL SUPPORT\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nFire and Rescue Department,\nDrainage and Sewerage Department, Local District Offices of BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nSocial and economic disparity\nof vulnerable communities are\naddressed in an integrated and\nholistic way, which exhibits co-\nefficiency with other actions.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nLocal communities and urban\npopulation, especially the socially and economically disadvantaged.\nWithin Bangkok, there is a significant gap between the disadvantaged and\nadvantaged. Among the disadvantaged are domestic migrants, labourers (local\nand foreign), city nomads and squatters. Other vulnerable groups include the\nelderly, disabled and children whose living condition is deteriorating due to factors like unemployment, poverty, poor health outcomes and inadequate housing, all of which reduces their capacity to find and maintain a living.\nDisregarding these people will only reduce the liveability of Bangkok and increase our resilience challenges, as vulnerable residents are less likely able to support themselves when disaster strikes. This action will seek to address a wide range of social and livelihood needs in vulnerable segments of the city's population, making the city more equitable and inclusive.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nBMA will engage with identified disadvantaged communities in Bangkok to\nunderstand their needs and get their input into the design of support services\nin a wide range of areas. These include accessible and affordable public utilities,\neducation and technologies to meet basic needs that underpin resilience. Financial support and knowledge transfer will also be provided based on community-driven needs to start community-based economies and micro-businesses that can help\nstrengthen networks, economic security, and social cohesion in the long run.\nTIMELINE:\n4 years (2018-2022)\n7.1.2\tPROMOTING DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE SECTOR FOR SUSTAINABILITY\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nSocial Development Department,\nDistrict Offices, Department of City Planning, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nAgricultural areas in Bangkok will be further developed for co-effective outcomes that increase economic value and earning of urban farming communities, land preservation for ecological service and temporary water storage, and environmental heritage of the city.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nAgricultural communities in Bangkok.\nThe expansion of Bangkok's built environment has encroached on fertile land\nwhich was once used for farming activities. These areas supported a common\nagrarian way of life, but only 13,774 farming households across 26 of 50 districts\nremaian. Recognising the importance of agriculture as an important livelihood\nfor some Bangkok residents, both in terms of food production and tourism, is\nimportant to Bangkok's history, as well as its ability to provide green infrastructure for flood protection This project will help the city retain its remaining agricultural areas.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nBangkok will take an integrated and participatory approach to promoting urban\nagriculture and sustainable farming practices on preserved farm land in the city.\nThe action will look at maximising the multiple land-use and co-benefits of farming through residential areas, communities' interaction and flood protection.\nThis project will use integrated planning to enhance adaptive capacity and provide planned incentives that allow alternate use of urban farm lands for multiple purposes including cropping, water retention, urban-agro tourism, and preserving biological diversity and ecological services. An agricultural sector development plan for Bangkok will be developed through a community consultation process. It will consider a range of options to support farming livelihoods, ensure sufficient earning of households relying on framing practices, and optimise land resources through flexible and integrated use of farm land.\nTIMELINE:\n3 years (2019-2022)\n7.2\tESTABLISHING BANGKOK AS A CENTRE FOR TRADE AND FINANCE\nTHE INTERCONNECTED NATURE OF THE DOMESTIC, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMY CREATES VULNERABILITY FOR BANGKOK, BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITY. BANGKOK MUST BE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH EVER-CHANGING ECONOMIC FORCES AND TRENDS, AND TURN RISK FACTORS INTO POSITIVE DRIVERS FOR ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. A KEY FACTOR FOR BANGKOK'S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STABILITY WILL BE ITS CAPACITY TO ACCURATELY FORECAST AN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, THROUGH THE IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF LOCAL AND GLOBAL TRENDS.\n7.2.1\tESTABLISHMENT OF BANGKOK ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CENTRE FOR TRADE, FINANCE\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nFinance Department, Strategy and\nEvaluation Department, Bangkok\nMetropolitan Administration, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThe initiative will empower BMA\ntowards fostering economic\nprosperity by enabling BMA to\naddress economic impacts from\nshocks and stresses, realizing city\neconomic growth and expanding\nfurther opportunity for economic\ncompetitiveness.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nLocal community, domestic and\ninternational entrepreneurs, business partners\/owners and investors.\nAs a major centre for investment, trade, travel and logistics, both nationally and globally, Bangkok has great potential to enjoy ongoing economic competitiveness and be a truly global city.\nThis requires a specialized and dedicated body to coordinate economic\ndevelopment in Bangkok - one that will set strategic directions and coordinate the many different players to collectively explore, collaborate and make decisions about economic opportunities.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe Economic Development Centre for Trade, Finance and Investment will be established as an affiliated body of BMA and tasked with all economic-oriented aspects of city development and support in realising Bangkok city's aspiration, as articulated in its 20 year plan, to become a \u2018City of Economy and Knowledge-Base\nfor Asia in 2030.'\nThe centre will be established to drive Bangkok's economic prosperity by better addressing economic issues and challenges, expanding trade and investment opportunities, promoting government-to-government and public-private partnerships based on shared benefit, economic equity and justice, and imbedding sufficiency economy theory for sustainable growth. Comprising a joint-committee for management from different departments, units and district offices of BMA, economic analysts, and financial experts, the centre will perform interim functions in tackling immediate economic issues and challenges. BMA will also develop a framework for long-term and permanent status of the centre, with defined mandates and functions, scope of services, staff resourcing, and necessary budget to enable success.\nTIMELINE:\n2 years to establish, then ongoing\n7.2.2\tDEVELOP ECONOMY, TRADE, FINANCE AND INVESTMENT ANALYSTS FOR BMA\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nFinance Department, Social\nDevelopment Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nBMA could be able to guide\nbusiness plan and strategies for local entrepreneurs and business, based on economic analysis.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBMA officials and officials of 50\ndistricts, local entrepreneurs, and\nSMEs.\nWhile Bangkok has enjoyed economic vibrancy and investment in various sectors including commercial property, tourism hospitality services, many other sectors have the potential to boot the city economy but have not been actively supported to realise their potential.\nWith a great diversity of economic activities in Bangkok, it is important that BMA and its district offices play a strong leading role in initiating and implementing proactive policy options and measures to facilitate and support trade, finance, and investment of different scales based on core-business compentencies, available production factors, and resources and skills in respective localities. This project will strongly contribute to ongoing attempts to achieve the economic aspiration outlined in Bangkok's 20-Year Development Plan (2013-2032).\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nBMA and the city's 50 District Offices will take a leading role in guiding and\nfacilitating Bangkok's economic development. To fulfil this role, 300 BMA officials will undertake training and skills development on a range of relevant topics related to expanding finance and economic opportunities in the city.\nThe objective of this program is to develop an understanding of the economy,\ntrade, finance and investment at the community and city scale and to equip BMA to build broader economic partnerships with its fellow ASEAN countries. These officers will serve as part of the Economic Development Centre for Trade, Finance and Investment outlined as part of this initiative.\nTIMELINE:\n2 years (2019-2021)\n7.2.3\tREDUCING RISK OF ECONOMIC SHOCKS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nFinance Department, Social\nDevelopment Department, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nBangkok and its residents have\nbetter options through readiness\nand remediation to reduce potential economic impacts.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nBangkok and its resident.\nBangkok's economy is influenced by a variety of factors including global and\nregional economic crises and changes in demand and other economic trends.\nSimilarly, negative consequences of large scale hazards such as floods, disease\npandemics, and major fire accidents in the city area do not only cause severe\ninterruption of business activities or damage of economic infrastructure, but also\nundermine confidence among both domestic and foreign investors.\nTechnological advancement has the potential to improve efficiency in the\nworkplace, however, it may also have unintended consequences. For example,\nautomation may lead to a decreased demand for manual labour and hence\ncause unemployment. As a result potential mechanisms for efficiency should be\nthoroughly investigated.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe Finance Department of BMA will take proactive actions to build a resilient\neconomy by putting in place a Bangkok Economic Plan to address projected\neconomic challenges in a timely and sustainable way.\nComprehensive studies will be carried out to develop a critical understanding of a range of risk factors, including the impact of emerging economic trends, such as increased automation and technological advancement at regional and global scale on Bangkok's current economic activities and structures.\nWhile the future will be inherently unpredictable, this work remains important for BMA's capacity to forecast and plan for expected future conditions, and make informed decisions on preparedness and mitigation options to turn challenges into opportunities.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year (2019-2020)\nGOAL 8: EXPANDING\nTOURISM, SERVICE\nINDUSTRY AND\nHOSPITALITY\nAs a world-famous tourist destination, Bangkok's\ntourism industry has significant opportunities for further growth to provide visitors with a fun, easy, vibrant, safe and culturally relevant visitor experience. BMA will support potential actors in developing business models and ways to upgrade tourism related services to an acceptable standard as well as improve tourist safety in order to expand its tourism markets. This is important for the economic and social resilience of the city, and the country, as the tourism industry of Thailand is responsible for 19 per cent of the country's GDP [14]. Bangkok will further expand its tourism, service industry and hospitality offer through:\n- Providing skills development for tourism operators\n- Enhancing tourist safety\n8.1\tPROVIDING SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FOR TOURISM OPERATORS.\nTO ENHANCE THE QUALITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF BANGKOK'S MANY TOURISM OPERATORS, A PROGRAM OF\nTRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE DESIGNED AND OFFERED TO OPERATORS TO BUILD THEIR BUSINESS AND ENSURE THEIR OPERATIONS MEET THE STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF VISITORS TO THE CITY.\n8.1.1\tTRAINING PROGRAM FOR TOURISM VENDORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nCulture, Sport and Tourism\nDevelopment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nGreater opportunities for Bangkok's tourism industry to offer a range of options and types of services for\ntourists and visitors with diverse\ntastes, interest and preference. This will contribute to further growth of the tourism sector.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nTourism service providers, vendors, local communities and residents.\nWhile Bangkok has wide array of tourism products and services to offer, a range\nof potential stakeholders owning cultural assets have limited understanding and\nknow-how to build upon the existing rich heritage. Small-scale business owners,\nlocal street vendors and communities around Bangkok with unique catering,\nlodging, cultural experiences should be supported to develop their businesses and to be aware of, and meet standards and expectations of tourists in the city.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nBMA will provide capacity development programs for business owners, service\nproviders, vendors and communities to assure quality tourism products and service delivery, and entrepreneurial opportunities for these businesses. Special focus will be on training of small and medium sized tourism-related enterprises and local\ncommunities, with guidelines, practical tools and processes for promoting and\npreserving cultural heritage for tourism purposes, business planning for cultural\nproducts and related businesses management.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year (2017-2018)\n8.1.2\tTOURISM SECTOR ANALYSIS AND ROADMAP FOR TOURISM PROMOTION\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nCultures, Sport and Tourism\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nClearer strategic direction for\nBangkok's tourism industry, an\nintegrated and comprehensive plan\nfor achieving growth in the sector\nand increasing competitiveness.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nTourism industry and related services and business in Bangkok.\nIn accordance with the BMA 20- Year Development Plan, to become a world-class tourist destination, BMA has to play an increasingly vigorous role in all aspects of tourism promotion, upgrading industry services and ensuring quality and\nregulatory standards. This requires strategic analysis, insight, and inclusive and\nforward-thinking planning.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nThis project will develop a roadmap based on analysis of the challenges and\nopportunities for tourism in Bangkok. BMA will facilitate the development of the tourism sector through a series of interrelated, prioritized interventions with role clarity of lead and supporting agencies and stakeholder mapping, while focusing on the role of culture for tourism development as one of key areas for tourism\npromotion.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year (2017-2018)\n8.1.3\tMODEL OF MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL PRODUCT FOR TOURISM PROMOTION (PILOT FOR BANGKOK NOI DISTRICT)\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nCultures, Sport and Tourism\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nThis pilot project will demonstrate\nhow tourist attractions can be\ndeveloped in local communities\nto showcase traditional lifestyles\nor cultural practices and to build\neconomic opportunities for\ncommunities. This model can then\nbe used by other communities\nto develop their own attractions\nand business models furthering\neconomic development supporting\nthe expansion of the tourism sector in Bangkok.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nCommunities owning cultural heritage and culture-related assets, cultural tourism service providers.\nThe tourism industry of Thailand is responsible for 19% of the country's GDP.\nBangkok, as a gateway for tourism in Thailand, is a major tourist's attraction with\nrich history and abundant cultural heritage, combined with modernized facilities\nand amenities. Opportunities still exist for Bangkok to showcase its cultural\ndiversity and heritage by offering visitors a unique, hands on experience of some of its traditional communities.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nBMA will further promote cultural tourism by developing a model for cultural\ntourism enterprise creation in Bangkok Noi District. This will be used to\ndemonstrate how practical plans and activities for the development of cultural and community tourism can be developed, replicated and adapted to other potential tourism locations. This project will showcase the process of identifying potential communities or other cultural experiences, marketing strategies, and sustainable management of cultural tourism. Participation of communities, local service\nproviders and cultural-tourism related business owners will be key for long-term\nmutual profit, including social development for communities, businesses and social equity.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year (2017-2018)\n8.2\tRESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BETTER RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS\nBANGKOK HAS PUT A HIGH PRIORITY ON THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF VISITORS TO THE CITY. BMA WILL\nCONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN EXISTING SERVICES AND CAPACITIES TO ADDRESS DIFFICULTIES, GRIEVANCES AND\nUNDESIRABLE SITUATIONS THAT TOURISTS MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN THE CITY TO ENSURE SAFETY AND CONFIDENCE OF VISITORS.\n8.2.1\tENHANCING TOURIST SAFETY\nIMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND\nPARTNERS:\nCultures, Sport and Tourism\nDepartment, BMA\nRESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES:\nTo build an integrated and robust\nsystem for the safety and security of visitors to Bangkok and enhance the tourist experience.\nBENEFICIARIES:\nTourists, tourism-related business,\ncommunity and residents.\nBangkok has a large amount of visitors each year. Tourist safety and security is a\nsignificant consideration for the city and tourists are currently provided with access to various types of assistance such as tourist police and tourist service centres.\nACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nBMA will further increase efforts to ensure that essential segments of the tourism\nindustry, including transportation, accommodation, tourist attractions, and other\nrelated services, thoroughly consider safety and security of visitors as part of\ntheir business planning activities. In this endeavour, BMA will provide businesses\nwith access to information through online, up-to-date situation alerts from\nreliable sources in times of emergency, and channels for lodging complaints and\nresponding to tourist grievances.\nTIMELINE:\n1 year (2017-2018)\nNEXT STEPS\nOur city is on a journey, one that will see it grow to be a safe, liveable and sustainable city for all its residents. This Strategy is an important milestone on this journey. It marks the\nbeginning of a resilience building approach that will plan and resource actions that address those things that are important to our city and not just those that are the most urgent,\nbreaking the cycle of being reactive instead of resilient. Now\nthat we have identified what is at the heart of our city's ability to be resilient, the time has come for us to roll up our sleeves and together, plan how we will transform our dynamic vision into successful implementation.\nBangkok is committed to delivering the 18 initiatives with 57\nprojects, identified in this Strategy. Not all of these will be\ndelivered in the first year, or even the second. Some will be\ncomplete within the first year, whilst others will continue on\nfor many years to come. The details of this implementation\nprogram will be covered in an implementation plan, to be\ndeveloped immediately following the release of this Strategy.\nBangkok has learnt from other cities in the 100RC network\nthat resilience projects, by their very nature, cross silos,\nsectors and agencies. Their implementation therefore\nrequires collaboration and buy-in across multiple agencies\nto ensure that these agencies can work together to leverage\ninvestments, engage effectively with the community and\ndeliver coordinated and transparent benefits to Bangkok\nresidents. Implementation agencies and partners will therefore be heavily involved in the development of an implementation plan to ensure coordination, streamline delivery and leverage investments for multiple resilience benefits.\nTogether with our partners, we invite you to come and share\nthe journey.\nIf you are interested to help Bangkok to be resilient, please\nsend an email to ResilientBangkok@gmail.com","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["Public Park","East","Democratic City","Soi Phrachaluamjai 7","Asia","Basin","City","Chao Phraya River","Bangkok","Gulf of Thailand","Safe City","Dusit","Rat Burana District","China","BANGKOK","South East","Yothee","King","Suvarnabhumi Airport","Venice","River Chao Phraya","Eastern Seaboard","Tha Phra","South East Asia","Kong Lad Buakhao","Thailand","East Asia","Green City","Samsen Road","Melbourne","Bang Phra Kong","Europe","Chao Phraya","Chao Phraya River Basin","Chao Phraya Basin","Bangkok Noi District","Klong Lat Ma Yom","Chao Praya River"],"DATE":["1917","2029","last four decades","1985","May 2014","2020","1977","1994","1980","1978","18-59","2021","1975","2007","1568","1915","2025","1100","late 1990s","1983","1993","2011","1851","1942","59","2030","today","last decade","1995","2014","1958","2013","2017","20th Century","1980s","21st century","1986","1782"],"ORGANIZATION":["7th Auspicious Ceremony","Department of Land transport of Ministry of Transport RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES","Phasi Charoen Canal","Resilient Bangkok Strategy","Environmental Sanitation and Health Department of BMA","Sewerage Department of BMA","Phetkasem Soi 69","Royal Irrigation Department","Ratchathewi District","Public Works Department","Swisse Re RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES","Private Health","Pollution Control Department","Ministry of Agriculture","Sewerage Department of BMA RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES","International Organization for Migration ( IOM","Compact City","Education Department of BMA","Economist Intelligence Unit","Local District Offices","\u2018 City of Economy","PPP","Health Department of BMA","Sewage Department","Institute of Urban Disease Control of Ministry of Public Health","Social Development Department","Environment Department","delta","Green House","Taling Chan District","National Institute of Development Administration ( NIDA","Rockefeller Foundation","Graduate School of Environmental Development Administration ;

And it is a great city, a prosperous city, all this is true.\nBut there is another Bristol, one that tourists and even some of our\ncitizens never see - the city of poverty and inequality. We have 42 areas among the 10% most deprived in England and 16% of our residents live in poverty. There is a persistent life expectancy gap between the most and least deprived areas (an estimated gap of 9.6 years for men and 7 years for women).\nAnd we know that the future will be even more challenging for cities like Bristol. We need to be prepared for more extreme weather, a growing and ageing population and a changing job market. All of these factors will impact most on our poorest citizens unless we focus on making their lives, and their children's lives, better.\nThat is why I am committed to taking the long view to lead Bristol towards a future where nobody is left behind. As set out in this 50 year strategy, my vision is to build a liveable city of opportunity built on fairness and inclusion. A resilient city, both socially and environmentally, which offers prosperity for all.\nWe cannot achieve this alone. We need all our city organisations - and our citizens - to work together towards shared priorities. The Resilience Sounding Board has modelled this new way of working and the Resilience Strategy gives us a compass for our future direction of travel. We could not have done this work without the inspiration and support of the 100RC and the other cities in the network and we are truly thankful and proud to be part of this global movement.\nBuilding a resilient Bristol will be difficult and it will take time. But together we can do it if we start now.\nMarvin Rees\nMayor of Bristol\nLetter from the President of 100 Resilient Cities\nMichael Berkowitz\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to congratulate\nthe city of Bristol on the release of the Bristol Resilience Strategy. In\nthis bold strategy, Bristol is taking an honest and proactive view of the\nchallenges the city faces today and in the fifty years to come. It shows\nno complacency with the leaps Bristol has already made, and unlocks\nresilience paradoxes by transforming them into opportunities.\nBristol's entrepreneurial, creative and pragmatic spirit is reflected\nthroughout this strategy. It represents a call to action for all Bristolians in a pursuit to strengthen social and environmental justice. None of this could have been possible without the excellent engagement of the Resilience\nSounding Board members. With backgrounds ranging from community\norganisations to universities and local businesses, these Bristolians ensured multi-stakeholder voices were heard. I also want to thank Bristol's Chief Resilience Officer (CRO), Sarah Toy, for her tireless dedication in driving the Bristol Resilience Strategy process forward.\nThe release of the strategy marks an important milestone for the city. Yet\nthe work is far from over. Mayor Rees's establishment of the City Office\nwill be an innovative way to include a wide range of stakeholders working\non resilience challenges in Bristol. Actions that address homelessness and\nenhance opportunities for meaningful work experience are but a few points named in this strategy that will secure a more resilient and equal Bristol.\nAs one of the cities selected in the first round of the the 100 Resilient Cities Challenge, Bristol has been on the forefront of leading our global resilience movement. We anticipate that the implementation of this strategy will\nbecome a best practice that other cities within the 100RC Network will\nemulate. We are thrilled to celebrate Bristol's achievement in releasing the\nBristol Resilience Strategy, and look forward to our continued partnership\nas Bristol spreads the urban resilience movement to cities across the\nUnited Kingdom and the world.\nSincerely,\nMichael Berkowitz\nPresident, 100 Resilient Cities\nVISION\nBristol believes that\nresilience = flourishing for all in the face of future uncertainty\nTHE WORLD IS CHANGING; BRISTOL IS CHANGING\nBristol is an independent-thinking, sustainable and culturally diverse city with a high quality of life. Bristol is thriving.\nBut there is no room for complacency. Our city - and the wider world with which it is vitally interdependent - is an increasingly complex and uncertain place. Changes are occurring at unprecedented rates in our economy, job markets, technology, environment, politics and population, and consequently our challenges are becoming both more severe and more unexpected. The city region's economic and physical growth, consequences of our success, also mean rising resource consumption and greater demands on health services and infrastructure. Meanwhile, our more chronic challenges remain: the gap between the rich and poor in Bristol is unacceptably wide, and growing; our current infrastructure connects us but also divides us; and our ambitions to be truly sustainable are constrained by our own resistance to change, national and international policies, and a lack of appropriate financing.\nThese challenges will not be resolved quickly; they will require investment, greater trust and social cohesion, and new social and technological innovations. Building a resilient future will be difficult and it will take time.\nAnd so it must start now.\nThat journey, however, is also an opportunity. The truly resilient cities of the 21st century will not simply manage risk or deal with challenges. They will evolve and become stronger through creativity, adaptability and flexibility.\nBy enabling the capacity and ingenuity of all of their citizens, these cities will use every disaster, crisis or challenge to recover in a stronger, smarter and fairer way.\nCOLLECTIVE ACTION\nThe vision of resilience articulated here is a distinctively \u2018Bristol' vision,\nand it is a genuinely collective one, emerging from not only rigorous data\nanalysis but also the experiences and opinions of thousands of Bristolians,\nas well as national and international friends. The Resilience Sounding Board\nwas created to provide diverse perspectives and to critically challenge one\nanother and the political leadership of the city. The Board includes those\nfamiliar with the expected resilience topics, including infrastructure, planning, climate change, disaster management and transport, but also those familiar with digital media, finance, social cohesion and the voluntary sector. But the Board knows that it does not have most of the answers, nor speak for all of Bristol, and we hope that we have approached this task with humility. We\nhave engaged over 1600 people from across the city and we have learned\nfrom and been inspired by them. Moreover, many of our Board members\nembarked on complementary initiatives, bringing in the perspectives of\nthousands of others. Throughout, our approach was to look backwards from a 50 year future vision to the present day, debating and discussing where and how we can work together with confidence to unlock creativity, disrupt business as usual and take the \u201cright\u201d next steps to set us on course. We thank all of you with whom we have engaged and all of those with whom we hope to engage soon.\nBased on those diverse perspectives, we have co-created this Resilience\nStrategy, comprising a 50 year vision, resilience pillars, goals and\ntransformative actions, all outlined in this document. In the spirit of\nresilience, this is not a fixed strategy replete with actions that might become inappropriate in our changing world, but rather a framework. There are too many unexpected challenges awaiting us and too many brilliant ideas waiting to be unleashed to dictate what actions must be taken. More\nfundamentally, resilience is not about proposing simple solutions to complex problems but about creating a political, cultural, and social framework that embeds resilience in every day decision-making. To stimulate action and\ndebate we do propose some initial actions, but we intend these to be only\nthe start, seeds of change, that along with many others will help our city\nadapt, survive and flourish in the face of future uncertainty.\nNAVIGATING OUR JOURNEY\nThis Strategy - in the spirit of something that is both complex and collaborative - is intended to be a dynamic process that will change over time as more people become involved, our collective thinking evolves and new challenges and opportunities emerge. We did not start from scratch, but built on some visionary work already done in the city such as High in Hope 2050 produced by The Initiative, Business West1. We see this Strategy as a compass by which to seek and find a wide range of exciting and transformative actions - many of which have not yet been thought of or tested at a city scale.\nIn other words, we are on a journey. The Strategy will need to have a clear owner and be resourced to make sure it can be implemented. Eventually, it must be adopted and its spirit incorporated across the city; but crucially at this early stage, it must be embedded in the political institutions of Bristol.\nTherefore, we call for a legacy structure that can implement the first steps of this Strategy while convening a city-wide approach to building resilience. But that legacy eventually will be owned by all of us, and so this document is most of all...\nAN OPEN INVITATION\nThe members of the Sounding Board are fully committed to supporting the delivery of this Strategy, whether as representatives of their organisations or as your fellow citizens. We hope that it can catalyse new ideas and inspire all of us to work together. We invite you - as an individual or as part of an organisation - to be part of this exciting journey. Contribute to the development of the initiatives proposed here and propose your own. Share your plans to become more resilient and your plans to help others. Challenge yourselves, each other and us to live up to the ideals presented here. We must be creative, flexible and adaptable but most of all, we must work together - the best way to become resilient is for all of us to become resilient.\n1.\tINTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT\nWHY URBAN RESILIENCE?\nWe live in a fast-changing, globally connected world. Bristol, like many other cities, faces challenges from a growing and changing population, climate change, resource scarcity, ageing infrastructure, changing patterns of world markets and employment, disruptive technologies and social and health inequalities. Currently, economic and physical growth is coupled with a growth in resource consumption, a trajectory that Bristol and other cities around the world will be unable to sustain as they continue to expand.\nThe scale of urban risk, in particular, is increasing due to the growing number of people living in cities. Risk is also increasingly unpredictable due to the complexity of city systems and the uncertainty associated with many\nhazards - most notably climate change. Communities and economies will need to develop the capacity to survive, adapt and thrive in the face of multiple and unpredictable disruptions in order to be resilient.\nWith growing recognition of these challenges, programmes to build \u201cresilience\u201d are being developed and implemented by a range of international, national and local organisations.\nResilience is a term that emerged simultaneously from the fields of engineering, ecology and psychology in the 1970s, to describe the capacity of a system to maintain or recover functionality in the event of disruption or disturbance. It is applicable to cities because they are complex systems that are constantly adapting to changing circumstances.\n100 Resilient Cities (100RC) \u2014 Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation supports 100 selected cities around the world to become more resilient to physical, social and economic shocks and stresses across the city system (www.100resilientcities.org). 100RC provides this assistance through:\n\u2022\tFunding for a Chief Resilience Officer(CRO) position for two years\n\u2022\tResources and support for preparing a resilience strategy\n\u2022\tA network of cities which face a diverse range of resilience challenges and provide opportunities for information sharing\n\u2022\tA range of services brought to the city public, by private and academic organisations (called Platform Partners)\nAll 100RC member cities have used the same working definition of urban resilience:\nUrban resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nStresses are chronic conditions which weaken the fabric of a city on a daily\nor cyclical basis; examples include high unemployment, health inequalities,\ninefficient public transport systems, endemic violence, and chronic food or\nwater shortages. Acute shocks are sudden, sharp events such as terrorist\nattacks, fires, floods, earthquakes, and disease outbreaks.\nBy addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able\nto respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic\nfunctions in both good times and bad, to all communities.\nThe qualities of resilient systems shown in Figure 1 are important in\npreventing the breakdown or failure of a system or of enabling appropriate\nor timely action to be taken. Cities can determine their overall resilience\nby understanding the presence or absence of these qualities within their\nsystems and services.\nBristol has taken the broadest possible view of resilience to help understand how the city can continue to flourish in the face of rapid change. Our focus is on ensuring that resilience helps to break away from \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d to take the city towards a flourishing future by securing multiple, cross-sectoral benefits from every (resilience-related) initiative undertaken.\nWe also want to demonstrate our commitment to delivering the global 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as they provide an overarching, long term framework which reconciles environmental priorities with equality and economic opportunity.\n100RC is particularly exciting for Bristol as it builds on the success of the\ncity's year as 2015 European Green Capital. Joining the 100RC Network is\nan opportunity to consolidate the city's ambition to be a world leader in\nresilient and sustainable city development. Our view is that sustainability and resilience are inextricably linked.\nWHY NOW AND WHY 50 YEARS?\nIn Bristol our resilience work is looking forward 50 years, to 2066 and beyond. We have used a range of tools and engagement methods, with support from the Government Office for Science Foresight Future of Cities Team and others, to develop a shared vision of the future and a direction of travel.\nBy developing an ambitious, long-term trajectory for the city, Bristol can rise to the global and local challenges that we face. Working backwards from a 50 year future to the present, we aim to unlock creativity and innovation and be confident that we are taking appropriately bold and ambitious steps in the short term.\nThis 50 year look ahead has helped us to realise the need for action now. In order to develop a flourishing future for Bristol, and improve our resilience to future uncertainty, we cannot wait for change to happen in the future.\nThe UN recognises that people are already moving because of climate stresses and changing weather patterns2. Many people are already taking action on issues such as these globally. Bristol has the opportunity to be at the vanguard of change - for example by leading on the Sustainable Development Goals, but more action is required across sectors now to move us to a flourishing future for the city.\nLEARNING FROM OUR PAST\nBristol's growth and change as a major city since its humble beginnings in the 11th century has much to teach us about future resilience. Significant social shifts can happen quickly and transform the city (as was seen through the closure of docks or building of the M32, for example) whilst other aspects of the city seem to go in cycles (immigration, regional governance for example). Being a resilient city means taking all of this in our stride, whilst constantly placing the welfare and quality of life of citizens at the heart of all action.\nOver the past centuries, we have seen a number of transformations in our city. These stories can help to inform our future trajectory:\n\u2022\tWe've moved from being an important node in the slave trade, to bus boycott and riots, to electing the first mayor of African or Caribbean heritage in Europe in 20163..\n\u2022\tBristol has strong association with Isambard Kingdom Brunel and the history of the railways, and has had a major port for centuries. In 2003 Concorde's last ever flight marked Bristol's significance as a hub for the aerospace industry, and in 2016 Bristol is home to a driverless car pilo4t.\nOur Chief Resilience\nOfficer, Sarah Toy\n(pictured above) led\nthe development of this resilience strategy and is responsible for the\nintegration of resilience thinking across the city, linking to a global network.\n\u2022\tBristol's food history was marked by significant family businesses such as Fry's chocolate manufacturer, and is now a hub for independent food production and retail, winning silver status as a Sustainable Food city in 20165.\n\u2022\tBristol's cultural history is significant; Bristol Old Vic is the oldest continually-operating theatre in the English speaking world6; and continues to evolve, with world-class 21st century animations and as home to Europe's largest street art festival, Upfest.\n\u2022\tThe tobacco industry was a significant employer in Bristol, with Wills having the largest factory in Europe in 19707. In the 21st century, we are spearheading anti-smoking action, with the first outdoor spaces in the UK designated as \u2018no smoking' in 20158.\n\u2022\tCivil protest around change has always been a feature of life in Bristol, with bridge tolls in 1793 and resident parking charges in 2015 sparking protests.\nUNLOCKING THE FUTURE\nBristol is internationally recognised as a city leader in renewable energy and smart city digital innovation. It is also proud of its independent spirit and its sense of creativity and fun.\nThis means that there is already a wealth of initiatives across the city challenging \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d thinking, with the aim of disrupting patterns to stimulate new (positive) behaviours. These initiatives - being spearheaded by public, private, voluntary and community organisations and individuals -are all important parts of the resilience jigsaw as they provide weak signals of future change. The city now has an opportunity to build on and connect these initiatives to underpin our resilience-building activities.\nThe development of the 50 year strategy, led by the Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) Sarah Toy, has prompted us to think more deeply about what these innovations have in common and what they collectively signal about the future of the city and their potential for scaling up.\nCity \u201cpattern disrupters\u201d have been identified as already challenging business as usual; these range from the establishment of municipal energy and waste companies to the development of Bristol's own currency, the Bristol Pound9, and from the development of a Bristol approach to citizen sensing10 to a new approach to river catchment management. Each of these actions either stretch the current system in some way, or operate outside the system entirely. Either way, they are actions that could begin to transform the city's systems if they are scaled up.\n2.\tUNDERSTANDING RESILIENCE\nOVERVIEW\nThroughout the resilience process we have modelled some of the complexity of systems changes by creating an iterative, non-linear, human-centred or so-called \u201cmessy\u201d method, involving: building new relationships (and challenging existing ones), talking about shifting power and engaging in open-space conversations and encouraging non-linear collective inquiry and collaboration.\nThis also involved mirroring some of the qualities of resilience - striving always to be reflective, inclusive, flexible and integrated.\nThroughout the resilience process we have modelled some of the complexity of systems changes by creating an iterative, non-linear, human-centred method.\nAPPROACH\nBristol already has\na highly engaged\nstakeholder community, which has gone from strength to strength during 2015 due to the city's European Green Capital status.\nStresses Relevant to Bristol\nTransport congestion Ageing infrastructure Climate change Environmental degradation Food supply Fuel supply Water shortages Change in political leadership Ageing population Health inequality Growing unemployment Economic downturn Population growth Civil and political unrest Anti-microbial resistance Devolution\nAs a Bristol citizen, the CRO felt strongly that everyone should have a stake in the city's future resilience. The approach taken was to build an open, inclusive process, tapping into existing networks and groups wherever possible.\nBristol already has a highly engaged stakeholder community, which has gone from strength to strength during 2015 due to the city's European Green Capital status. It was therefore important to build on this sense of shared priorities and encourage city dialogue throughout the resilience assessment process. Over 1,600 people were engaged in meetings, focus groups, workshops and events.\nThe aim was to create as many opportunities as possible for strategic partners and stakeholders across the city and region and across the 100RC global network to work together to explore innovative ways in which cobenefits can be delivered through collective inquiry and collaboration.\nThe stakeholder engagement was complemented by a robust analysis of available data to review our shocks, stresses, strengths and weaknesses, and to understand how the city operates in order to focus efforts to strengthen our resilience and help Bristol to flourish over the coming 50 years.\nA range of more detailed research and analysis of our selected themes and discovery areas was undertaken, in order to improve our understanding of\nShocks Relevant to Bristol\nDisease outbreak Public protest\/disorder Terrorist & malicious attacks Industrial action Major infrastructure failure Industrial accidents, environmental pollution & ordnance International event Transport accidents Severe weather (esp. flooding) Structural hazard\nthe issues and to uncover potential opportunities and actions that could\nbe addressed through the Resilience Strategy. This work was co-ordinated\nby the CRO, and undertaken by a range of stakeholders in working teams,\nsupported by Arup where appropriate for certain tasks.\nMuch of this research surfaced opportunities for interventions that could\nbe included in this Resilience Strategy. In addition, we also sought input\nfrom a range of stakeholders. We applied a multi-criteria analysis to these opportunities, to identify those that would most effectively address Bristol's specific resilience challenges. This evaluation included a high-level assessment against the drivers of resilience as set out in the City Resilience Framework (CRF), that have been considered most significant for Bristol; the critical shocks and stresses that were identified; and the qualities of a resilient city. This was then complemented by our knowledge of Bristol and the activity that was most likely to lead to transformation as a result of being scaled up.\n3.\tRESILIENCE PARADOXES\nOur work has identified five key paradoxes that articulate Bristol's challenges at different\ncity scales - from the individual to the community to the regional and global context.\nBristol, as an economically developed city with limited exposure to natural shocks, is a city that, in many ways, is thriving. Our resilience challenge is largely felt in underlying stresses and growing global uncertainty, such as our changing climate or health inequalities in the city. Its successes lie in its pioneering and independent spirit and personality. It is a city with vibrant cultures and a high quality of life. We want to use the concept of resilience to help Bristol to flourish today as well as in the future.\nOur work has identified five key paradoxes that articulate Bristol's challenges\nat different city scales - from the individual\/community to the regional and global context. These five paradoxes are derived from our analysis of the shocks and stresses that threaten Bristol's resilience.\nPEOPLE\nCommunities are diverse, but inequality threatens cohesion\nBristol's population is diverse, with 45 religions, 91 languages and 187 places of birth. This diversity, which is set to increase over the coming decades, is part of what makes the city a vibrant place to live. At present, we largely co-exist respectfully and peacefully but inequality between different communities and neighbourhoods compromises social cohesion. The root causes of inequality, coupled with the challenge of a rapidly ageing population (there will be 120% more people aged over 90 in Bristol by 2039), need to be tackled to ensure that in the future the city is made up of socially cohesive communities with all individuals having the assets and capacity to thrive.\nPLACES\nBuilt environment is \u2018greened' but not yet transformed\nBristol is seen as a \u2018green' city, having been the first UK city to hold the title of European Green Capital in 2015. Ambitious public commitments have been made to be zero carbon by 2050. However, we know that more audacious, bolder steps are needed to transform the built environment and people's behaviours. We also know that increasing uncertainty, particularly in relation to a changing climate, means that we need to adapt to future uncertainty and risk. Managing stresses such as transport congestion and ageing infrastructure is an important part of this challenge. Radical solutions, coupled with new forms of financing, must be secured to transform Bristol into an attractive and prosperous post-carbon city.\nORGANISATIONS\nCivil society is engaged, but not connected\nMany parts of the city are already highly engaged in working collaboratively to plan the future of the city, from grassroots activists to academia, from third sector bodies to City Council teams, from youth councils to partnership bodies, but this enthusiasm to cooperate is not always harnessed. Power is still perceived to lie, in top-down, siloed systems that operate in short-term political cycles. There are also many citizens who feel disconnected or unable to influence the future of the city or the wider city region. The interests, aspirations and actions of citizens and civic society must be better connected to the city's formal planning, decision-making processes and delivery mechanisms to create a truly participatory future city.\n20 BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nPROSPERITY AND WORTH\nREGIONAL TO GLOBAL\nThe city is economically successful,\nbut not equally flourishing\nBristol's success is measured in economic terms by Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\/Gross Value Added (GVA) and is regarded as a highly productive net contributor to the national economy. It is also home to a higher number of creative industry start-ups than any other UK core city, as well as having the highest number of patent registrations. This is despite significant differences in health, income and access to opportunities between different communities and neighbourhoods. The gap between communities\nneeds must be closed so that decent opportunities\nare accessible to everyone. Housing affordability is an\nincreasingly important issue for the city.\nBristol is also increasingly recognised as a leader in next\neconomy \u2018pattern disruptions' such as the Bristol Pound\nand Happy City11 and there is a strong movement to place more importance on the wider concept of flourishing but\nthere are currently no city-scale metrics to truly value -and therefore aim towards - non-economic outcomes.\nThe city is focused on strengthening local self-sufficiency but continues to be dependent on national and global systems\nMany of Bristol's innovative projects and pattern disrupters are focused on promoting self-sufficiency and circularity of systems - for example encouraging local consumption and production with the Bristol Pound or reducing our carbon footprint and waste streams. However, this needs to be finely balanced with the need to continue to benefit from national and international systems and infrastructure that provide some of the basic services we need to function well in times of prosperity, as well as in times of stress. These range from our energy infrastructure, to the global food market and location of global corporations in Bristol. This national and global interdependency can also make us vulnerable to a range of external shocks that we have little control over locally.\nBy 2066 Bristol is a\nflourishing, welcoming\ncity which inspires\nconfidence in local and\nglobal investors, and our success is shared by all.\n4.\tFRAMING OUR FUTURE\nOUR VISION\nThis sets out our long-term direction of travel. It reflects the need for change at all scales: stating with individual citizens, through local communities and neighbourhoods, to the city as a whole and its place in the wider world.\nBy 2066 Bristol is a flourishing, welcoming city which inspires confidence in local and global investors, and our success is shared by all. Our neighbourhoods are affordable, attractive, healthy and well-connected places where people of all ages and backgrounds trust and help each other. Our infrastructure and services are flexibly designed and managed to cope with uncertainty.\nFive pillars have been developed to describe the outcomes that we can hope to achieve over the course of the coming decades, in support of this vision.\nThese five pillars are supported by goals over the next 50 years,\ndemonstrating the direction of travel for the city.\nResponding to each of the five paradoxes set out in section 3 will help us to move towards achieving these ambitious outcomes for Bristol.\nA range of innovative and disruptive actions have been developed to support this vision, pillars and goals as detailed in the next section.\nFair\nEvery person living in Bristol has the assets and\nopportunities to enjoy a good quality of life.\nGoals, by 2066 Bristolians will:\n\u2022\tBe free from discriminatory practices\n\u2022\tBe providing opportunities for all to close the education gap\n\u2022\tProvide affordable housing for all\n\u2022\tBe free from child poverty\n\u2022\tBe free from health inequality\n\u2022\tDeliver a fair income ratio in the city between highest and lowest incomes\nAddressing the resilience paradoxes: Achieving greater equality and social cohesion are crucial to increasing Bristol's resilience: this means providing affordable energy, water, food, shelter and access to employment for all as well as ensuring everyone can take part in the life of the city.\nLiveable\nThe city centre and neighbourhoods are great places\nfor people of all ages to live, work, learn and play.\nGoals, by 2066 Bristolians will:\n\u2022 Benefit, across the whole city, from the multi-functional value of green infrastructure and the natural environment\n\u2022 Live in an all age-friendly city, with all ages able to access all necessary services within a 20 minute journey by active travel or a sustainable mode of transport\n\u2022 Achieve clean air for Bristol\nAddressing the resilience paradoxes:Green infrastructure and the natural\nenvironment can provide multiple benefits such as active travel, improved\nair quality, improved health and wellbeing, and reduced impacts of flooding,\nclimate change, and environmental degradation, and reduced transport costs.\nSustainable\nThe city and region prosper within environmental limits\nthrough adopting new behaviours and technology.\nGoals, by 2066 Bristolians will:\n\u2022 Develop a zero waste city \u2022 Live in a carbon neutral city\n\u2022 Operate environmentally responsible and fairtrade supply chains\nAddressing the resilience paradoxes: To live within our environmental limits we will aim to use resources (products, components and materials) to their highest utility in the economy. This builds resilience by reducing the impact of resource scarcity (e.g. energy, food, water, materials), future-proofing our infrastructure and our economy, and protecting our natural environment.\nAgile\nBristol citizens and leaders make effective decisions based on shared priorities and real time information.\nGoals, by 2066 Bristolians will:\n\u2022\tBe using city data to reduce inequality\n\u2022\tDevelop new partnerships to co-create and scale up city solutions\n\u2022\tDeliver local bonds and place-based investment to transform the city\nAddressing the resilience paradoxes: Being more agile will help to future-proof Bristol's infrastructure and wider assets, whilst also promoting longterm resilience planning rather than just short-term financial returns. It will also help to deliver jobs and skills for local people, whilst empowering citizens to support projects they are passionate about, and providing key infrastructure assets for Bristol.\nConnected\nA strong network of local communities promotes\ntrust, co-operation and shared action across the city.\nGoals, by 2066 Bristolians will:\n\u2022\tBe living by a city charter for shared values\n\u2022\tBenefit from city-wide community cohesion\n\u2022\tDesign and deliver services by self-organised communities\nAddressing the resilience paradoxes:By implementing actions related to this pillar, we aim to develop a participatory culture, by undertaking projects that appeal to those across a community with tangible outcomes, where participants contribute and benefit equally.\n5.\tREIMAGINING THE CITY\nWe know that in order to be resilient over the next 50 years, we will need be reflective, and able to learn and adapt over time. We also know that Bristol is defined by its pioneering attitude, willingness to experiment and lead with engagement from a wide range of partners.\nThis section sets out a collection of some - but by no means all - of the pattern disrupters that will challenge business as usual in the city to put us on a more resilient trajectory for the future. We are committed to delivering, catalysing or scaling these in the short to medium term.\nThe diagram above serves to signpost the actions contained within the remainder of the document.\nShort-term = 1-2 years\nMedium-term = 2-5 years\nLong-term = 5 years+\n1\nTackling street\nhomelessness\nBristol is experiencing a rise in homelessness with the city having a significant gap between demand and supply of suitable accommodation for homeless people and families. The aim is to eliminate or significantly reduce involuntary rough sleeping in Bristol within 12 months, whilst ensuring that the quality of accommodation provided.

Bristol stakeholders will work with Mescaldis to identify an appropriate neighbourhood and local partners and funders to deliver an initiative in Bristol to build a dialogue about immigration, diversity and neighbourliness.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Mescaldis, Bristol City Council, Community Theatre Company, Watershed, Pervasive Media Studio, Playable city, Bristol Cultural Development Partnership, Ujima, Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS)\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short-term\n\u2022\t100 RC Platform Partner: Citymart\nResilience value: Improved social cohesion and stability by engaging communities on diversity and immigration through art.\nThrough the 100RC network Bristol was selected to\nparticipate in the citymart social cohesion challenge, which source innovative ideas from around the world.\n3\nVotes for\n16 year olds\nWhile Bristol has an active youth council and 16 and 17 year olds across the city hold many responsibilities in society, they do not have a chance to influence key decisions which will define their future. Extending votes for 16 year olds will provide 16 and 17 year olds with the chance to be involved in democracy, resulting in even younger engagement, and ensure youth issues are represented.\nThis will follow the precedent set by the Scottish Elections (Reduction of Voting Age) Act, May 2016, which allows 16 and 17 year olds to vote in Scottish Parliament elections and local government elections.\nIn Bristol, this would mean asking for the devolved responsibility to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote in local elections.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, Votes at 16 Coalition, Youth Council and Youth Mayors\n\u2022\tTimescales: Medium-term\nResilience value: Increased cohesion through empowering young people to be engaged and heard by policy makers.\n4\nSocial action\nvolunteering\nFollowing an initial two-year set up period, funded by Cabinet Office and supported by Nesta and Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bristol and partner cities will develop the role of the active citizen in the \u2018life' of the city.\nOver the next two years the team will aim to work with the private, voluntary and community sectors as well as other parts of the public sector to create a whole city approach to addressing key city challenges through social action. Some of the projects that will be scaled up include:\n\u2022\tVolunteer platform - Creates easy access to information from many sites of volunteering opportunities.\n\u2022\tEmployer Supported Volunteering (ESV) - BCC is updating its staff volunteering policy and working with other employers to implement this.\n\u2022\tNational Citizens Service (NCS) - Bristol to become a pilot for the new NCS scheme, with a focus on cultural and media sectors for young people.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, NCS Trust, Office for Civil Society (OCS), Voluntary & Community Sector, Voscur\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short - medium-term\nResilience value: Promoting social action and volunteering across the city will aim to empower a broader range of stakeholders to become involved and active citizens.\n5\nCitizen data\nengagement\nWe will leverage data to find solutions to city issues, using existing and near-term initiatives such as REPLICATE. We will build the capacity of organisations and citizens to use data to shape projects and achieve \u2018smart' city outcomes.\nREPLICATE (REnaissance of Places with Innovative Citizenship And Technologies)\nis a \u20ac25 million Smart city \u2018Lighthouse' project. In Bristol, it is employing digital technology to explore the impact of integrating smart energy and smart transport interventions in the neighbourhood of Easton. Bristol is a city within the URBACT Resilient Europe network which aims to share experiences on resilience and sustainability across the network. Bringing these two projects together will enable Bristol to develop a real neighbourhood focus to data engagement.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: University of Bristol, Bristol City Council, Knowle West Media Centre, Learning city, Easton Community Sector\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: We aim to use data to develop better decision-making, both in real-time and in terms of longer-term planning. The City has the potential to engage a wide range of stakeholders in new ways, from inspiring citizens to promoting more integrated management of assets.\n6\nParticipatory City\nParticipatory City is a global initiative empowering local people to invent unique and innovative projects, which see them working together on ideas which make their neighbourhoods more exciting and enjoyable places to live.\nA large demonstration neighbourhood in London is starting in early 2017. It is intended that this neighbourhood will become a model for wellbeing, sustainability and equality. Bristol will learn from this.\nKey to the success of the project will be the ability of the neighbourhood to collaborate widely to bring many fresh ideas together in an open source environment.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, Demonstration Neighbourhood\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: Through this action we aim to develop a participatory culture, though undertaking projects that appeal to those across a community with tangible outcomes, where participants contribute and benefit equally.\n7\nGreen and\nBlack\nInclusiveness and environmental awareness are key concerns for Bristol now and in the future. The Green and Black initiative aims to kickstart a long term series of activities and relationships with Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities around the legacy of the European Green Capital year.\nThis action will focus on developing young BAME ambassadors to raise environmental awareness in their communities and more broadly around the city. It is intended that the programme will engage the \u2018future city' academics at the universities and act as a catalyst for one or more corollary projects in both the Impact and Research agendas. One larger scale project is hoped to emerge that the partners can take to an external\nfunder (e.g. Esmee Fairbairn) for support.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol Green Capital Partnership, Ujima, University of Bristol, Bristol City Council, Social Intelligence Institute\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: The empowerment of young BAME citizens to share environmental awareness with communities and the city improves inclusiveness and understanding of environmental issues.\n8\nCommunity-based\nadaptation\nCommunities that are self-organised in day to day life are inherently better prepared to respond to, and recover from, unexpected events in their neighbourhoods. Community based adaptation (CBA) has been pioneered in developing countries to build capacity in vulnerable and marginalised communities to become more resilient to climate change impacts. An important lesson from CBA practices is that a multilevel, cross-sectoral approach involving a range of different stakeholders - including the residents themselves - is necessary to develop adaptive capacity and build long term resilience.\nThis action builds on the principles of CBA and experience from a number of existing projects and initiatives in Bristol, the south west and other cities around the world. It aims to develop a more integrated and inclusive approach to working with communities to empower them with the knowledge, confidence and resources to take action when affected by local shocks.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, Cities of Service team, Local Resilience Forum, Groundwork (funded by Big Lottery Fund), Bristol Resilience Network, Community Development teams, UL Cabinet Office, Voscur\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short-term\nResilience value: Providing communities with the resources and capacity take action to deal with shocks means neighbourhoods will be better able to respond and recover from events.\n9\nNew models of\nhousing delivery\nBristol is facing a housing crisis. Yet decent affordable homes are the foundation of a successful city. The Mayor has pledged to deliver 2,000 new homes (800 affordable) per year by 2020. This will be achieved by setting up a Local Housing Company. This Company will have a remit to promote use of brownfield sites across the city for housing, work with local communities and support the development of alternative housing initiatives such as co-housing and communal living that aim to tackle wider social challenges such as social isolation and community cohesion. Affordability will be addressed through reduced running costs of sustainable homes.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, University of West of England, University of Bristol, Registered Social Landlords, Bristol Housing Board, West of England authorities, local builders, Community Land Trusts, Bristol and Bath Regional Capital CiC, developers and investors (e.g. Meridiam)\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short - medium-term\nResilience value: Helps to reduce inequality in the city, ensure housing provision for a growing population, future-proof our infrastructure and build social cohesion.\nLearning from elsewhere - Housing for a Resilient New Orleans\nTo combat new city trends, such as a 50% increase in cost of rental since 2000, Housing for a Resilient New Orleans has created an integrated housing framework. This uses the strength of a growing local economy and creates a new approach to providing affordable housing choice for residents.\nIt creates new policies and tools to address new and long-standing challenges so everyone can participate in the city's growing prosperity. This guided by three core principles: equity, collaboration and openness.\nThis will support development of new affordable rental and homeownership opportunities, preserve affordability, expand access to opportunity using the fair housing principle, and increase accessibility for vulnerable populations.\n(http:\/\/www.nola.gov\/home\/buttons\/resilient-housing\/)\n10\nFree bus travel\nfor under 16s\nCurrently there is free bus travel in Bristol only for children under 5, with half price tickets for those ages 5-15. Those aged 16 and under can receive a free bus pass, for free school travel from the Council if they go to their nearest school and meet certain distance or safety eligibility criteria. Extending this free service to all under 16s on all journeys within the city will promote lifelong bus use; reducing congestion and enabling children to independently access the facilities and resources of their city. Lessons can be learnt from Transport for London who provide this on all on their bus and tram services.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: First Group, Bristol City Council\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short - medium-term\nResilience value: Providing under 16s with free bus travel encourages public transport use and eases congestion allowing better city connectivity.\n11\nRepurpose Neighbourhood\nPartnerships\nLocal scale funding can help local communities to increase social cohesion and build local capacity. Through the Avonmouth Community Resilience Fund, Bristol is trialling a new approach, with a focus on local priorities of jobs and employment, a flourishing high street and social impact.\nBristol is also involved in an EU project, URBACT, which will inform new possible models for improving neighbourhood-level resilience.\nNeighbourhood Partnerships are designed to allow decision-making to have an impact at a local level. Through a new approach, they can become truly representative and help to channel funding to new local research-backed initiatives, systems, and policy changes that help provide an inclusive approach to improving resilience.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, Neighbourhood Partnerships, Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS)\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: Local scale funding to local groups promotes inclusive and cohesive communities improving resilience.\nLearning from elsewhere - Portland, Oregon\nIn 2005, the City of Portland engaged community members in a comprehensive review and assessment of Portland's 35-year-old neighbourhood and community involvement system. The result was a unique, comprehensive and strategic \u201cFive-year Plan to Increase Community Involvement in Portland.\u201d The ongoing implementation of this plan by the City of Portland and its community partners is dramatically increasing the scope and quality of public involvement and participatory democracy in Portland.\nAs part of this, a new Neighbourhood Small Grants program was created. Additional community organizing and technical assistance staff were added to the Office of Neighbourhood Involvement to work with community groups and city agencies.\n[source: http:\/\/participedia.net\/en\/cases\/five-year-plan-increase-community-involvement-portland-oregon]\nBristol's CRO is working with CROs from Vejle, Rotterdam and Glasgow, as well as other European cities to share learning on participatory processes.\n12\nLegible City\nBristol Legible City (BLC) is an innovative project started 20 years ago as a unique concept to improve people's understanding and experience of the city through the use of identity, information and transportation projects.\nThe project has recently agreed funding for the next initiative which is to develop innovative city mapping and information resources to support change to more sustainable forms of transport and encourage active travel choices. The initiative will deliver a suite of digital, printed and street-based information products to encourage residents and visitors to explore the city on foot, bike and using the public transport system. BLC's user-centred approach to wayfinding and transport information has been developed to support better public health and reduce greenhouse gas production.\nThe initiative will deliver an enhanced pedestrian wayfinding system across the city and develop new user-friendly information for the cycle network, the MetroBus project and the wider public transport system.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: BCC, Legible City, MetroBus\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short - medium-term\nResilience value: Improving communication of sustainable and active travel options will increase citizen take up and help improve wellbeing and reduce congestion.\n13\nBristol Transport\nPlan\nThis action will promote the development of a 20 year plan to create better places and help people move around by enabling a large scale shift to sustainable transport in Bristol. We currently have plans to deliver new transport infrastructure within the current funding and planning cycles, this strategy will enable us to look further ahead and to test more radical interventions to reduce congestion, carbon emissions and ensure infrastructure is resilient to climate change.\nTo support the development of this strategy, we will explore working with MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Smart to quantify the impact of different transport options. We will use 50 year scenarios to support strategy development, and will ensure other transport strategy refresh projects are integrated with this longer-term view.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential city partners: Bristol City Council (Transport); Network Rail, West of England Authorities, Sustrans; First Group; Bristol Ageing Better; Child Friendly City; University of the West of England\n\u2022\tPotential 100RC platform partners: MIT Smart\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: Resilience value: Lowering the number of car journeys and increasing active travel will help to protect the natural environment, through improved air quality and reduced carbon emissions, improve health and wellbeing, and reduce transport congestion costs.\n14\nClean air city\nBristol is part of an EU funded consortium of universities and research institutions to actively engage European citizens in measuring their personal impact on air quality and CO2 emissions in their cities. The project will use innovative tools like specially made apps and games for smart phones to generate citizen-led policies to improve air-related health in our cities.\nThousands of people across Europe will be invited to share their views on how to reduce air pollution and improve related public health in six pilot cities. Residents will use a game on their smartphones, tablets and laptops to suggest how their home cities should develop in the future. The result will be directly translated in improved city policies.\nIn Bristol we will focus on raising awareness about poor air quality and work with citizens to identify simple actions that can improve air quality in their local streets.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: University of West of England, Bristol City Council\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: Engagement with citizens over air quality issues and actions that can improve their city increases both social connectivity and air quality benefits.\n15\nClimate change\nadaptation plan\nAs a signatory of the Compact of Mayors, Bristol has a long-established approach to climate change mitigation. This action will build on this success and develop an approach to adaptation to climate change.\nA plan will be developed to future-proof the city by identifying the major climate hazards and their potential impact, a framework for adaptation, and identification of strategies to build climate resilience. Consideration of the issues will be required at a city scale with actions targeted at a local scale with their benefits well communicated.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council\n\u2022\tTimescales: Short-term\nResilience value: A climate change adaptation plan will identify risks and strategies to mitigate these challenges, building resilience across the city.\n16\nEstablishing a resilient\ncity financing structure\nBristol will explore options for establishing a Resilient city financing structure by aggregating a suite of small and large scale place-based projects focusing on improving local resilience (e.g. flood defences, green infrastructure, community facilities and new housing). The structure would seek to blend public and private money and take a long term view (at least 25 years) to achieve a social as well as a financial return on investment.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, Bristol Energy and Waste Companies, Bristol & Bath Regional Capital Community interest Company, University of Bristol, University of West of England\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: We know that we need investment that is able to recognise longterm resilience value, rather than just short-term financial returns. We aim to deliver jobs and skills for local people, whilst empowering citizens to support projects they are passionate about, and providing key infrastructure assets for Bristol.\n17\nManage our\nfuture flood risk\nTidal flooding from the River Avon has the potential to cause severe damage to the city centre. Bristol's Central Area Flood Risk Assessment (CAFRA) predicts that the current trend of rising sea levels will accelerate due to the impact of climate change, causing the likelihood of tidal flooding in central Bristol.\nA strategy is being developed to recommend an adaptive programme, identify when flood risk management interventions are needed and examine how they will be funded.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, Environment Agency, Local Enterprise Partnership\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: Bristol needs to be bolder in how in responds to the changing climate.

Bristol will build on existing initiatives, including Avon Wildlife's Trust's My Wild Street, Wessex Water's Rainwater City, and Embleton Road SuDs, to develop an approach that communities across the city can engage in.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol Green Capital Partnership, Bristol City Council, Avon Wildlife Trust, Wessex Water, Sustrans\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: Greening neighbourhoods improves citizen wellbeing while improving the cities resilience to climatic change.\nLearning from elsewhere - Metropolitan Urban Forest Strategy, Melbourne\nDuring the Millennium Drought (1998-2007) many of Melbourne's trees were in a critical state, so work had to be undertaken to replant and protect them. Since 2012, 12,000 new trees have been planted. The Urban Forest Visual project developed a map of 70,000 of the city's trees. It provides data on the life expectancy, species of tree and the option to \u2018email the tree'.\nThe aim was that residents could know more about the city's trees, their importance and email reports to the Council on the state of the trees. Instead, people used this as a chance to write love letters to trees. To date, 3000 emails to trees have been received from all over the world.\n[http:\/\/melbourneurbanforestvisual.com.au\/#abo]\n19\nEquality\ncharter\nInequality, lack of social mobility and exclusion from the economic, social, cultural and political spheres are among the key challenges facing Bristol's communities. A range of people and representatives from Black and Minority Ethnic communities and groups came together to develop a Bristol Manifesto to Race equality that was launched in 201512. This manifesto sets out a clear declaration of values, vision, and intentions for the city's communities, a call for action, and a timeline. The Manifesto highlights key areas where racial inequalities persist and where the gaps are widening.\nThe City Council now plans to build on this work by developing an Equality Charter which will apply to the Council and any organisation that the council commissions, grants aid to or procures services from, to include governance, administration and delivery. The council is also committed to addressing the underlying issues facing Bristol in attracting BME candidates for senior positions within the Council.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, Voscur, Avon and Somerset Black Police Association, SARI, Black South West Network, Building the Bridge, Nilaari, Ujima Radio and Somali Media Group\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short-term\nResilience Value: The persistent inequalities in the city, particularly associated with race, are a negative force in our social connectivity and our economy which threaten our long term resilience. By addressing these issues with focused action we can build a fairer, more cohesive, and therefore resilient future for all Bristol's residents.\n20\nCity knowledge\nexchange platform\nWe will explore a range of options for developing an open knowledge platform for connecting people, organisations, ideas and knowledge across the city. It would enable ideas to be connected across themes such as climate preparedness and could connect project ideas with possible funders.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: 2Degrees, Bristol City Council, Bristol Green Capital Partnership, private sector sponsors\n\u2022\tTimescale: Long-term\nResilience value: An open knowledge platform will enable collaboration and the sharing ideas across the city enabling connectivity.\n21\nCity Office\npartnership working\nThe Mayor is committed to setting up a new City Office to tackle cross-cutting, complex issues through a shared approach to strategic leadership with the ability to deliver tangible outcomes through targeted projects. It will aim to help collective actions, help to remove barriers to change and connect with new people in new ways. The City Office will provide a strong focus and coordination role for the excellent partnership working that is already well-developed in the city. For example, it will work closely with existing groups such as the Bristol Green Capital Partnership (BGCP) which is an independent leadership organisation founded in 2007. It has more than 850 member organisations, ranging from businesses and the public sector to charities & community organisations. It is currently working on a range of projects towards its vision of \u2018a sustainable city with a high quality of life for all'.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: city leaders (from politics, business, community and voluntary sector, public\/managerial professional, unions), existing city partnerships\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short to long term\nResilience Value: In order to address the complex challenges of building long term resilience and to make sure we leverage the social and environmental as well as the economic benefits of focusing on resilience we need to connect across city organisations and sectors.

The City Office will provide leadership, direction and coordination at a city-scale to harness the potential and deliver on the right priorities to ensure the city is resilient and can prosper in the face of change.\n22\nChild Friendly City\nDespite 25% of the city being made up of those aged 18 or under their views are often neglected. A Family Friendly City conference will investigate what constitutes a family friendly city and will highlight the rights and needs of children and young people as active Bristol citizens and vital city assets. This will include people from a wide range of backgrounds, including international networks, small local organisations, as well as the opinions of the youth council and younger children.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Room 13, Architecture Centre, Playing Out, University of Bristol, European Child-Friendly Cities Network, Youth Council and Youth Mayors and Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS)\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short-term\nResilience value: A better understanding of needs of young people in the city will improve long term planning and engagement with these citizens.\n23\nVoluntary Sector\nStrategy\nIt is vital that the city retains an independent voluntary sector that campaigns for social justice and challenges inequalities, whilst at the same time harnessing social action and providing services to the city's most vulnerable people. We recognise the value that Bristol's not for profit sector brings to the city through its capacity for innovation and its ability to bring additional resources into the city through charitable giving, fundraising, and social enterprise. We will produce a Voluntary Sector Strategy to set out how the sector will work with the city to provide services and support focused on reducing inequality.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Voscur, City Office, University of Bristol, University of the West of England, Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise Sector\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short-term\nResilience value: Strong partnerships contribute to Bristol resilience, and a focus on inequality will help to address this chronic stress.\nVaried and frequent\nexperience of work\nThe Learning City Partnership Board, supported by the Mayor's City Office, is leading the delivery of more varied and frequent experience of work for all young people in the city. The newly created WORKS is the development of a physical and virtual \u2018Engagement Hub' to bring businesses, education providers and young people together. The aim is to provide career related activities and work placements that will raise aspirations and secure successful career pathways for all, with an accompanying e-portfolio to record young peoples' experience.\nMany young people do not have the personal networks to gain varied and regular experience of the world of work, particularly those who are more vulnerable, such as in the care system, and those living in more deprived parts of the city. This lack of experience has a direct impact on young peoples' employability and in turn the development of the local workforce.\nA focus on experience of work will galvanize the collective endeavour, building on best practice, of the city's education providers and local employers. Successful local programmes, such as HYPE West, will help to ensure those young people furthest from the labour market are supported into employment. Digital technology solutions to communicate with and engage young people, like Skills Bridge which connects university students with the community projects, will be developed in partnership with the sector.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Learning City Partnership, City Office, city employers and education providers, Bristol City Youth Council\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short to medium term\nResilience Value: By improving employability prospects for young people in Bristol we are building the workforce of the future to ensure that the city can respond agilely to the changing job market. The focus on increasing access for poorer or vulnerable young people will build resilience into our social system and ensure the city becomes a fairer and more prosperous place for everyone.\n27\nCity metrics and Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals\nWe will develop a new set of high level city metrics for all stakeholders to aim towards a fairer, happier and more sustainable city. This will help us move away from relying solely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - a high level economic growth indicator -as the headline measure of our success.\nThe work already done by Bristol-based Happy City Initiative, along with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provide useful frameworks and tools for developing a new, inclusive set of Bristol metrics. These need to be developed and agreed with a wide range of city partners so that they can then be used as the basis for designing and evaluating future city policies and programmes across different organisations and policy areas. They can also be used to raise public awareness and as a mechanism to anchor the city's international engagement.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Happy City, Bristol SDG Alliance, Bristol City Council, Bristol Green Capital Partnership; Common Good; Health and Wellbeing Board; Local Enterprise Partnership; Local Nature Partnership, Black Network South West\n\u2022\tTimescale: short term (awareness- raising) and medium term (implementation) Resilience Value: A set of metrics that measures city progress against parameters such as wellbeing, and inclusion alongside traditional economic indicators will help us move towards fairer and more sustainable future growth across the city and region.\n28\nEngine Shed 2\nThe Engine Shed is a venue designed to host a hub of activity where entrepreneurs, business leaders, academics, students and corporates can collaborate. It is recognised as a prominent, active, innovative and provocative environment dedicated to promoting sustainable economic growth in collaboration with a number of significant partners.\nThe intention is to build upon the success of the first phase of the Engine Shed to implement the Engine Shed Phase 2 (ES2). This will be embedded in the existing facility and aims to build something more powerful and sustainable. It will provide more floor space for business incubation, business growth and space for meetings, collaboration, teaching, exhibition, display and discussion13.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: University of Bristol, Bristol City Council\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short-term\nResilience value: Providing space and support for collaboration and sustainable business growth will encourage resilient economic growth.\n29\nProtecting and\nvaluing green space\nWe will develop a high level assessment of the financial value of green spaces across the city to assist with future investment decisions. A valuation analysis of the natural capital in Bristol's parks will be conducted, which includes certified values of each ecosystem service. There is a lack of sustainable funding for green infrastructure. This assessment will provide an evidence base to support increased uptake and delivery of green infrastructure projects, both improvements to existing green space and delivery of new projects.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, Avon Wildlife Trust, Local Nature Partnership, Natural Capital Trust, Bristol & Bath Regional Capital CiC, Arcadis\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience value: Multiple benefits of green infrastructure uptake may be experienced including improved air quality, improved human wellbeing, and reduced impacts of flooding, climate change, and environmental degradation.\n30\nYoung Future\nBristol\nThe young people of Bristol need to be equipped with digital skills today to make sure they are not excluded from accessing the growing future jobs market in the region's digital and high tech sector. The school curriculum is not equipping pupils with these skills and most children from less privileged families do not have opportunities to gain these skills outside of the school setting. Young Future Bristol has been set up to target this future skills gap and build a new generation of coders and technologists and internationally to support the delivery of a technology engagement programme for young people. They provide the \u201ckit\u201d (laptops and Raspberry Pis) and technical expertise and guidance to help young people develop digital skills for the future workplace.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Digilocal - led by High Tech Bristol and Bath with sponsorship from local businesses, CodeClub and DigiLocal clubs, Knowle West Media Centre, Bristol City Council, Youth Council\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short - medium-term\nResilience Value: The aim of this action is to enhance educational outcomes and reduce inequality by empowering students to realise their full potential. This will help improve access to jobs and skills and enhance social cohesion at a neighbourhood level.\n31\nActive and healthy ageing\nThe ageing population is a challenge for the future of the city. We need to support older people to remain independent and active as citizens and within the economy as long as possible so allowing them to live more fulfilling lives as well as reducing the impact on public spending and public services. We make sure Bristol is a good place for people to grow old. We also need to explore and develop new ways of providing the support that older people will need.\nOne such innovation in development is the plan to create a supportive mechanism for older people (over 55) to continue in, or re-enter, the job market. This may take the form of a bespoke older people's employment agency offering opportunities to have internships working with partner organisations and companies.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tAnchor Society, Business in the Community, University of West of England, Bristol City Council, Bristol Ageing Better, Age UK, Older People's Forum, Business West, West of England Local Enterprise Partnership\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short to long term.\nResilience Value: Supporting older people to remain working and active citizens improves wellbeing and fulfilment while reducing the impact of an ageing population on public services.\n32\nOpen data\nplatform\nBristol City Council's open data goal is to unlock value for the Council, citizens and\nbusinesses by sharing Bristol's data to address city challenges, promote innovation\nand make the city more open and accountable. The council already shared over 130\ndata sets on its open data platform but in order to extend reach and impact the\ncouncil is currently developing its open data ecosystem to make it easy a possible for employees, external organisations and citizens to interact with data.\nThe Council also understands that publishing and encouraging access, use and re-\nuse of data is only a part of the process, and is therefore committed to an ongoing\ncommunity engagement programme. Current engagement activity includes, but is\nnot limited to, an open data challenge series and support in the delivery of \u2018The Bristol Approach to Citizen Sensing' with Knowle West Media Centre.\nDelivery\n\u2022 Potential partners: Knowle West Media Centre, Bristol City Council \u2022 Timescales: Short-term\nResilience Value: Improving accessibility and citizen engagement with city open\ndata platform provides citizens with the capability to create innovative and resilient\nsolutions to city challenges.\n33\nNatural Capital Trust\nWe will support the development of the Natural Capital Trust (NCT) as an innovative mechanism to deliver enhancement in the quality of the natural environment across the West of England region. The NCT will act as a conduit of funds from developers, and from potential beneficiaries of Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes,\nto support a range of projects which ensure provision of services by ecosystems,\nenhancing (amongst other things) resilience to the effects of climate change and of the region's infrastructure.\nDelivery\n\u2022 Potential partners: Bristol City Council (and other local authorities in the region); West of England Nature Partnership; Health and Wellbeing Board; Local Enterprise Partnership; utility providers; developers; E nglish Nature; Environment Agency; Highways Agency\n\u2022 Timescale: Medium-term\nResilience Value: Supporting and funding projects which enhance ecosystem\nservices can provide a range of resilience benefits from improved well-being to\nreduced impact from extreme climate events.\n34\n100RC Post Industrial Group\n- Next Economy\nWhilst Bristol has a great story to share, we have a lot to learn from other cities. We want to explore how other cities are addressing the legacy of post-industrialisation to transform into thriving and vibrant places\nWe will work with the post-industrial cities of Glasgow, Boulder, Durban, Huangshi, Melbourne, Pittsburgh, Rotterdam and Vejle to share best practice and develop new innovative approaches to local challenges.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Glasgow, Boulder, Durban, Huangshi, Melbourne, Pittsburgh, Rotterdam and Vejle\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience Value: Knowledge sharing with other cities with similar challenges provides the opportunity to share lessons from successful projects and develop new approaches to address city issues.\n35\nUrban Integrated\nDiagnostics\nThe Urban Integrated Diagnostics project promotes research and innovation initiatives that help to improve the city's health, well-being and prosperity as they face up to challenges of modern urban living.\nThe Bristol \u2018pilot' project will bring citizens together with researchers, local authorities and partners from business and the voluntary and community sector aimed at investigating the very real challenges facing the city across four areas: mobility and accessibility, health and happiness, equality and inclusion, and tackling dependency on fossil fuels. Bristol will learn from other pilot cities of York, Leeds, Newcastle & Gateshead, and Birmingham.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, South Gloucestershire Council, University of Bristol, University of the West of England\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short-term\nResilience Value: This project will help Bristol to learn and adapt, improving our knowledge, helping to tackle stresses such as inequality and transport congestion.\n36\nResilience Impact\nAssessment\nBristol City Council currently requires major initiatives and investments to be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and an Equalities Impact Assessment (EQIA). The use of a resilience lens to assess the impact of initiatives and projects would provide an integrated and systemic view of risks and impacts associated with city interventions. Some 100RC cities such as have introduced the use of the resilience lens to assess projects. New Orleans, for example, has established a Resilience Design Review Committee for regular project review.\nThe release of this strategy provides a timely opportunity to consider how resilience is embedded into design and implementation of city and regional projects. A group of officers will be convened in the City Council to develop proposals for integrating resilience thinking into internal assessment processes.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council, 100RC Cities\n\u2022\tTimeline: Short-term\nResilience Value: Providing a means of assessing project resilience will enable that resilience to be a key consideration which influences design for projects.\nLearning from elsewhere: Resilience Design Review Committee, New Orleans\nThe City of New Orleans has established a Resilience Design Review Committee to undertake regular project reviews. This meets monthly to review and advise the CRO on all construction projects either funded as a resilience programme or that have storm water and green infrastructure components.\nhttp:\/\/nola.gov\/resilience\/designreview\/\n37\nResilience and West of\nEngland devolution deal\nBath, Bristol and South Gloucestershire councils have proposed \u00a31bn West of England devolution deal which is now up for public consultation. The deal would devolve, from the government, agreed funding and powers to the region, including decisions regarding transport, investment, funding, skills training, business support, housing and strategic planning.\nA workshop will be held to explore how devolution of funding and powers could improve city resilience through integrated into the new governance structures.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential city partners: Bristol City Council, Bath and North East Somerset Council, South Gloucestershire Council, West of England Civil Society Partnership\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-term\nResilience Value: Devolution will provide city regions in the UK with funding and powers across skills, infrastructure, and strategic planning. This action will help to embed resilience into those areas.\n38\nBritish Standard\non city resilience\nThe British Standards Institute is working to develop a good practice guidance standard in relation to city resilience.\nBristol, amongst other 100RC cities, will host a workshop to inform the development of the standard, peer reviewing the intended approach. This is to reflect the status and work that is continuing in Bristol to make it more resilient.\nThe standard will act as guidance for the city leaders and as a management framework for executives with responsibility for different resilience themes within cities.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Cabinet Office, Glasgow, Manchester, London, 100RC\n\u2022\tTimescale: Short-term\nResilience Value: Supporting the development of a city resilience standard will promote the concept of resilience to city leaders and organisations and provide guidance to others, as well as assisting Bristol with its process of continual learning.\n39\nClimate Strategy\nand Energy Framework\nBristol City Council has created the \u2018Framework for Climate and Energy Security' as part of being European Green Capital in 2015. This is the start of an ambitious process which seeks to create an integrated, adaptable and inclusive, sustainable city. This low carbon plan will be vital to reach the new target for Bristol to be Carbon Neutral by 2050. This is to be reviewed and refreshed every three years to provide a continuous process of improvement.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council\n\u2022\tTimescale: Medium-long term\nResilience Value: Providing continuity of energy supply in an uncertain future is an important part of a resilient Bristol.\nBuilding on Success: Bristol Energy Company and Bristol Waste Company\nIn 2015, Bristol launched the third municipal energy company in the UK. Bristol Energy is a fully licensed energy supply company, wholly owned by Bristol City Council.\nThe Energy Company aims to offer competitive, fair and simple energy tariffs with any profits reinvested back into local communities. Over time it will become the delivery vehicle for major energy efficiency and low carbon energy projects. Its initiatives focus on supporting customers to use less energy, make homes cheaper to heat and helping communities become more self-sufficient.\nThis provides a new model of ownership, allowing a focus on the delivery of public good. It is an approach that has been replicated with Bristol Waste Company. Bristol will learn from this way of working, which may be replicable in other areas.\n40\nAdaptation & resilience\nframework for the Bristol\nAvon catchment\nThis is a multi-agency collaborative initiative to identify opportunities and risks for organisations by climate change disruption and economic austerity through greater integration of actions across sectors and political boundaries working at a catchment scale. This innovative initiative is in the process of engaging with other key strategic planning organisations and infrastructure providers to understand the interdependent risks and opportunities and deliver cross-sectoral adaptation actions in spatial planning at a catchment scale. It will address relevant Global Sustainable Development Goals at a local scale and highlight where the enhancement of our regional natural capital could be made in multiple distributed locations, to deliver multi-beneficial outcomes from collaborative investments.\nBy integrating the framework into existing work streams, operational and investment plans, development decisions can be made based on wider identified risks, with wider costed solutions and routes to delivery that enhance the value of existing and future investments in the region.\nThe ultimate aim is to create an attractive sustainable place for future generations, with a strong regional economy and enduring infrastructure supported by sustainable agriculture and resilient natural capital.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Wessex Water, Environment Agency, Natural England, Highways England, Bristol City Council, South Gloucestershire Council, Bath and North East Somerset Council, Wiltshire County Council, West of England Nature Partnership, Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, West of England Local Enterprise Partnership, Wiltshire and Swindon Local Enterprise Partnership, Bristol Water, Bristol Avon Catchment Partnership.\n\u2022\tTimescales: Medium-term to Long term\nResilience Value: This approach is bringing together a wide range of stakeholders with diverse interests to plan in an integrated way for the long-term resilience of our region's natural resources. This offers a resilience dividend in terms of increasing resilience to climate change risks as well as improving biodiversity, recreation, food production and reducing costs associated with treating polluted water course.\n41\nHorizon scanning\nIn order to keep preparing for change we will need to carry on anticipating future trends and risks. Whilst the Civil Contingencies Act currently limits forward planning to 5 year time horizon the government recognises the merits of longer-term planning and the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre is constantly in engaged in anticipating future global trends with a 30 year out time horizon. In Bristol we would like to use and build on this work as well as the future scenarios developed by Arup for this strategy (see Appendix) to evolve our planning for emerging challenges such as security of infrastructure and other city services to cyber threats.\nDelivery\n\u2022\tPotential partners: Bristol City Council Civil Protection Unit, Schumacher Institute (Prepare for Change programme), Arup, MoD Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre, 100RC network\n\u2022\tTimescales: Short to medium-term\nResilience Value: Horizon scanning and keep abreast of weak signals and emerging global trends will help us to be an agile city that can respond to change and develop integrated, cross-sector and multi-agency response to complex challenges such as cyber security.\n42\nBristol is Open\nI Bristol Is Open (BIO: http:\/\/www.bristolisopen.com) is a Joint Venture between the Bristol City Council and the University of Bristol. BIO is deploying a city scale open and programmable test-bed for experimentation and digital innovation in smart cities. Embedded new technologies cut across all aspects of the city development including ultra high-speed connectivity, Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-security, data analytics, transport and utilities. BIO works with local partners, SMEs and large corporations to develop and demonstrate technology solutions and services for smart cities.\nBristol Is Open advocates that smart technologies are a critical enabler for resilience in cities.\nDelivery\n\u2022 Potential partners: Bristol City Council, University of Bristol, Engineshed, WaterShed, @Bristol, Knowle West Media Centre, NEC, Interdigital, Nokia\nResilience Value: The \u201csmart\u201d offering in Bristol Is Open, is guided by the principle that every resident should have access to technologies that are essential for their productivity, wellbeing and enjoyment. The unique proposition on programmability empowers local residents, communities and businesses to innovate and develop new smart capabilities to better serve their social and economic needs and ultimately enables new approaches that will help the city to prosper.\n6.\tOPERATIONALISING RESILIENCE\nThe Strategy sets out a clear framework and set of resilience lenses through which to prioritise actions which will ensure the city is on course towards a flourishing future. It will also be important for individuals and organisations to change and adapt the way they work to meet the fiscal, social and\nenvironmental challenges ahead. Through the process of developing the\nStrategy, five ways of working have been identified that are strongly aligned with the qualities of resilience.\nThese ways of working are not new to the city; as described below there are many examples of organisations already piloting or embedding these approaches.\nThe five ways of working are;\n1.\tFOCUSING ON ASSETS\nAn asset-based approach recognises and builds on the human, social and physical capital that exists within local communities. It is a positive way to work with people by identifying what they value most and then shaping public services that meet real needs. This is in contrast to a deficit model which tends to focus on the negative aspects in communities and try to \u201cfix\u201d them.\nAsset Based Community Development Approach (ABCD) in Bristol\nThe Bristol City Council Community Development team has been piloting the ABCD approach with some communities in the city and there are many stories emerging about how communities are taking action to make things happen in their neighbourhoods. One such story is Bristol \u2018Soup' in St Pauls. Four Bristol women came together to organise the first Bristol \u2018Soup', an idea which came from Detroit in the US and there are a few across the UK. As the name suggests it's a big eating (or drinking) of soup! People pay for a bowl of soup (which has been donated), local groups pitch to win the money taken on the night and the audience votes for the idea they like the most. The first event saw 80 people attend at St Pauls Learning Centre and raised \u00a3320. Of the four pitches the favourite was Bristol West Indian Cricket Club who went away with the winnings. They were featured in a programme on Made in Bristol TV.\n2.\tMOVING UPSTREAM\nThere is strong evidence that tackling \u201cupstream\u201d factors in people's lives such as housing, neighbourhood conditions and access to jobs can reduce\n\u201cdownstream\u201d disparities in health - particularly among racial and ethnic\nminorities. The principle of moving upstream can applied more broadly to\nthinking about preventing or averting difficulties in people's lives before they become a problem to solve. Bristol has been piloting and developing an approach to early intervention in troubled families which have yielded impressive results. The principles can be extended to most areas of service delivery to ensure that risk factors are identified, and treated holistically by a range of professional working together, before they become entrenched and costly problems to solve.\nThink Family\nBristol's Think Family programme is achieving life-changing results for the city's troubled families. The council, working in partnership with Avon and Somerset Police, has developed an approach to identify vulnerable children at risk of sexual exploitation and delivering necessary support at an early stage. Underpinning the approach is the marriage of a data warehouse containing the records of 170,000 individuals across 54,000 families and advanced predictive analytics most commonly used to predict risk in the finance sector. The outcomes are impressive. Adopting this approach, that requires professionals to see the problems facing a family as a whole and to treat these issues holistically, the team has increased the number of families that can be supported from 150 to 1000 per year. There has been a 50% reduction in unauthorised school absences, the number of police call-outs has halved and there has been a three-quarters drop in adults requiring Anti-Social Behaviour intervention. The result is an adaptable model that is identifying families at risk of breakdown and enabling intervention before issues become entrenched. The programme is a beacon of best practice, attracting substantial government interest with nearly 50 local authorities already learning from it.\n3.\tCO-CREATING\nIn the business world, co-creation means involving your customers in\nproduce design because it makes good business sense. There is a growing recognition that this approach also pays dividends when designing and delivering services in the public sector. Creating new solutions with people, not for them, can help drive radical innovation. However, this requires a culture-shift away from top-down, bureaucratic processes. In Bristol there is a real appetite for co-creation and many city partnerships have been established to help drive this new way of working. One example is the way the new Bristol Impact Fund was developed. The proposed city Office will be an important vehicle for encouraging and modelling ways of co-creating solutions.\nBristol Impact Fund\nBristol City Council currently invests around \u00a37.7m per year in grants\nto Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) organisations. Historically\nthese grants have been delivered through many separate funding\nstreams with no single view of how well that funding is working for\nthe city as a whole for example in reducing inequalities or improving\nhealth and wellbeing. The decision was taken to align the grant streams through one \u201cProspectus\u201d in order to focus on priorities and challenges and be clear about outcomes. This Prospectus, which was developed\nin partnership with VCS partners led by Voscur, represents an exciting\nand bold step forward in how the Council works with VCS colleagues\nto co-design and co-create a shared view of how to address the needs in our city. It also represents a clear commitment to work with the expertise and local knowledge of the VCS to shape and deliver the right support and services to those most in need of support.\n4. DISRUPTING\nAs discussed previously the idea of \u201cdisruption\u201d is central to challenging business as usual and unlocking parts of the system that are not currently steering us towards a resilient future. The idea may not sit comfortably\nwith many people - it's always easier to work within the status quo - but the challenges ahead such as climate change and population growth are too big to sleepwalk into the future cling onto the status quo. And anyway, disruption will happen whether we like it or not; you only need to look at the phenomenal success of Uber or AirBnB to see that change will happen in spite of the system. In Bristol we already have a strong culture of disruption for social innovation and we can build on this and grow our confidence to proactively shape the future city that we want for our children and grandchildren.\nThe Bristol Pound\nBristol's currency - the Bristol Pound (\u00a3B) - was launched in 2012 as a collaboration between the Bristol Pound Community Interest Company, Bristol Credit Union, Bristol City Council, the Transition Network, New Economics Foundation and QOIN. The currency, like the Brixton Pound and other UK schemes, aims to create local economic resilience and greater self-determination by disrupting patterns of globalisation and chain-store dominance. Four years on there are more than \u00a3B1million in circulation in the city and the BPound team are now working with some of the 900 businesses enrolled in developing an interest-free credit scheme across their supply chains. Some of the benefit some of the benfits to the city of using the BPound are:\n\u2022\tShortening the supply chain and hence carbon footprint (outlets using the BPound have to demonstrate they sources products\/ ingredients locally);\n\u2022\tBuilding a culture of shopping locally which contributes to neighbourhood social cohesion;\n\u2022\tReducing shopper's car trips\/car emissions as most BPound shops are walking distance in neighbourhoods\n5. LEARNING\nIndividuals and institutions that are reflective use past experience to inform\nfuture decisions, and will modify standards and behaviours accordingly.\nBristol is already committed to promoting individual learning and in 2015 set up the Learning City partnership to: champion learning for all ages and all communities; commission activity to increase participation and achievement; communicate messages about learning; and celebrate the benefits of\nlearning as a way to transform lives. In 2016 Bristol became the first city in\nEngland to become part of the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities.\nLearning from the CRO network\nThe network of Chief Resilience Officers that 100RC has created a\nunique safe space where cities can share successes and frustrations\nand offer practical advice and examples of best practice to encourage and inspire each other. In Bristol we asked the CRO network for examples of their climate change adaptation plans. We received responses (within less than 48 hours!) from seven major cities\naround the world sharing their plans and experiences of working on\nadapting to climate change. This helped us to benchmark what was\npossible and achievable and be more aspirational and bold in our own approach to preparing for climate change.\n7.\tNEXT STEPS\nDeveloping this Strategy has been the first step on the journey towards a more resilient and flourishing future. All the stakeholders involved - including the Resilience Sounding board - are fully committed to taking this forward to implementation. The next steps now are to:\n\u2022\tEstablish ownership - the proposed Mayor's City Office offers a strong place to hold the Strategy and oversee its future implementation;\n\u2022\tSecure additional resources - the funding from 100RC for Chief Resilience Officer ends at the beginning of February 2017;\n\u2022\tDevelop and investment programme to work with 100RCplatform partners - there is up to $5million of pro bono city tools and services on offer to Bristol and the region which will need to be matched with city priorities;\n\u2022\tCarry on the city conversation and work out how to use this Strategy as a living document...it doesn't end here, this is just the start!","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["London","Easton","BRISTOL","Black South West Network","Upfest","Pittsburgh","New Orleans The City of New Orleans","Bristol Avon","Natural England","Voscur","Birmingham","Avon","United Kingdom","Bristol","Boulder","US","Rotterdam","esp","Glasgow","Detroit","Happy City","River Avon","Durban","Learning City","Avonmouth","St Pauls","Whilst Bristol","Ujima","England","Glastonbury","York","Leeds","Caribbean","Highways England","Melbourne","Vejle","Bristol Pound","Legible City","Sustrans","New Orleans","Europe","Wiltshire","Oregon","Nilaari","Rainwater City","Brixton Pound","Bristol Manifesto","Huangshi","Manchester","Bristol Old Vic","Portland"],"ORGANIZATION":["Bristol Pound Bristol","City Office","Bristol Credit Union","Energy Company","West of England Local Enterprise Partnership \u2022 Timescale","City Council","High Tech Bristol","Interdigital","University of West of England , University of Bristol","Bristol Resilience Network","Crisis Centre Ministries , Bristol & Bath Regional Capital CIC","Voluntary & Community Sector","Bristol-based Happy City Initiative","Based Community Development Approach ( ABCD","Wessex Water","Green and Black","Shocks Relevant to Bristol Disease outbreak Public protestdisorder Terrorist & malicious","Doctrine Centre","Bristol Avon Catchment Partnership","Global Sustainable Development Goals","Legible City Bristol Legible City ( BLC","BLC","Compact of Mayors","the University of Bristol","Natural Capital Trust","Newcastle & Gateshead","Pervasive Media Studio","England Nature Partnership ;

Our\npeople are the backbone of our city and have always shown a willingness to\nadapt, change and reinvent during our long and rich history.\nAs leader of the city, I am proud to present Glasgow's first resilience strategy.\nThis document shows us how we can adapt and grow no matter what challenges the future holds.\nGlasgow has weathered so much change throughout our history from the industrial revolution and the decline of our traditional industries to the recent economic downturn. However we have always shown a flexibility and strength of character which has allowed us to capitalise on new opportunities for growth.\nGlasgow is already a resilient city but it is in our nature to want to do more. That's what this strategy is all about.\nIt is a distinct feature of the Glaswegian spirit that we always look first at tackling inequalities and ensuring that our least well off communities are at the heart of all our thinking. I want our city to be a fairer, more just place where resilience grows from strong communities.\nThis strategy has been informed by an intensive and innovative process of community engagement. Our resilience conversation has linked to more than 3,500 local residents across all age groups and communities to ensure that this strategy\ndraws on a diverse range of voices. I want our people and the institutions which\nserve them to continue the conversation.\nGlaswegians love to debate and dispute and that is the foundation of a strong city democracy. We are also a friendly, neighbourly and tolerant people and these features too are the very basis of our resilient city. That's why we can face an uncertain future with confidence.\nGlasgow was proudly named as one of the first members of 100 Resilient\nCities - pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) - in December 2013. Our membership of the network represents a major step towards creating a strategic, multi-disciplinary approach to proactively managing the\nshocks and stresses the city may face.\nThis strategy is a roadmap towards greater resilience. It focuses on the continued transformation of Glasgow. Our ambition is for fair economic growth and a stronger city. We have become aware from our citywide discussions that resilience emerges from a range of inputs. This Strategy has a key role itself in helping to connect\nthose inputs and to ensure our city considers resilience as an explicit and intended product of our work.\nWhilst the strategy vision is directed to the long-term future, the actions detailed in it have an initial two year timeframe for delivery. Thereafter, this action plan will be subject to a refresh ensuring that a clear focus on action is maintained and a continuing dialogue with residents is created.\nOur Resilient Glasgow Strategy has been shaped through engagement with the people of Glasgow including residents, businesses, voluntary organisations and public sector partners.\nAs Chief Resilience Officer, I will continue to work with city partners and communities to develop strong collaborative capacity to push forward the delivery and implementation of this Strategy.\nI give special thanks to all of our partners for their hard work and dedication in making this Strategy possible. My gratitude extends to the team at 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) for their energy and commitment and the 100RC Strategy Partner Arup for their instrumental guidance and support.\nAbove all, my thanks go out to you, the people of Glasgow for sharing your aspirations and ideas for a stronger and more resilient future. Your confidence and enthusiasm has been an inspiration to me throughout this process.\n100 Resilient Cities is honoured to partner with the great city of Glasgow\nin their effort to pioneer solutions and develop an actionable roadmap to\nresilience building. Embedding resilience in the fabric of a city's planning\nand policymaking can create a thriving city in good times and bad, and yield\ndividends that will make a city stronger for years to come.\nFirst and foremost, this would not have happened without the vision and passion of Council Leader Cllr. Frank McAveety, Alastair Brown, the Chief Resilience Officer, and his extraordinary support team, who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to produce this visionary document. A highly engaged steering committee,\nthe members of five diligent working groups, and Arup were instrumental in\nguiding and informing this process.\nGlasgow's rich history, architecture, and culture are a testament to its resilience. The city has met many of the challenges of transitioning from an industrial to post-industrial city with innovation and creativity. During their resilience strategy process, the \u201cGlasgow Game\u201d showcased an extraordinarily robust and diverse approach to engaging stakeholders around a variety of future scenarios that are relevant for Glasgow. This is crucial. Today's challenges may not be the same tomorrow. Building lasting urban resilience requires recognizing the interplay of a city's strengths, weaknesses, shocks, and stresses. It is about bolstering the foundation of a city so that it can respond to new, unforeseen events. It is also about making decisions under circumstances where institutional and individual financial resources are limited.\n100 Resilient Cities is committed to working with Glasgow in the coming years.\nWe bring with us a powerful cadre of public, private, and academic sector partners\n- the \u201c100RC Platform\u201d - that are also committed to this partnership. Unlocking this\nsupport and signalling a growing marketplace that is interested in working with\ncities that incorporate resilience thinking into their planning process is a key tenet\nof the 100RC philosophy. We are excited to work with Glasgow at the forefront of a new global movement to build urban resilience. And cities and nations near and far\nare taking note of these ground breaking achievements!\nhighlights the key indicators that any resilient city should aim to fulfil. This tool, designed by Arup with support from The Rockefeller Foundation, is a framework through which Glasgow will continue to assess the connections between our resilience challenges, review areas of\nweakness, and recognise opportunities to build on our many strengths.\nWe integrate both types of challenges through this strategy, particularly building on Glasgow's\nexisting strong approach to emergency planning and response within a broader agenda of\nresilience to daily stresses.\nFurther, we recognise the following qualities as being an integral part of Glasgow's story.\nWe will continue to integrate these qualities into our day to day business so that we not only maintain essential functions in the face of acute shocks and chronic stresses, but also grow and thrive through them.\n100resilientcities.org\nOUR RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nThis Resilience Strategy is the main output of our work with 100RC to date, and the starting point for a holistic programme of resilience action. Development of the Strategy has been led by Glasgow City Council and partners, however, it belongs to the City of Glasgow and we hope that you will all play a part in moving us collectively towards a more resilient future. This Strategy has emerged from an extensive programme of work including research and analysis of the actions already underway throughout the city that contribute to resilience. This has been considered alongside in-depth consultation with Glaswegians and advice\nprovided by expert stakeholders through regular Steering Group and Working Group\nmeetings. This approach has given us the opportunity to identify where there may be gaps\nin our existing approach and opportunities to build on the great work we are already doing. Our membership of a global network of cities has given us the opportunity to think about our future and how we can plan ahead with a global approach. Whilst adaptation to climate change remains a principal focus of Glasgow's approach, this peer network allows us to\nshare experience about the challenges of planning for a variety of chronic stresses and\nacute shocks in urban life. As a result, the scope of our Resilience Strategy has broadened.\nThe future is always uncertain, but there are things we can do now and actions we can set in motion which can help us to be more resilient in the face of the challenges which that future will undoubtedly bring. This Strategy commits us to addressing challenges proactively,\nstarting today.\nOur Resilient Glasgow Strategy is structured around four \u2018strategic pillars' and fifteen \u2018goals', which set out the long-term trajectory for Glasgow's resilience. Within this, we have identified forty-nine actions that will be implemented during the next two years. After this time, our action plan will be reviewed and refreshed.\nGlasgow has an extraordinarily rich history characterised by unshakeable strength and\ncontinuous reinvention in the face of shocks and stresses. We can learn the lessons of our city's past to teach us how we can make a better future.\nGlasgow is an incredibly old site of human settlement. The remains of canoes from Stone\nAge times have been found, for example, by the banks of the Clyde. In one of our main\nparks an Iron Age camp has been excavated. And in the churchyard of Govan Old there is\nevidence of Christian burials dating back to the 5th Century, indicating that it is one of the\nvery earliest places of Christian worship in Scotland.\nThe city is known globally as one of the great powerhouses of the Industrial Revolution. In\n2015 we commemorated the 250th anniversary of James Watt conceiving of the separate\ncondenser to the steam engine as he walked on Glasgow Green. This was perhaps the\nsingle most significant act in powering the Industrial Revolution. The ripples from Glasgow's transformation lapped the shores of the whole world: Glasgow made history on a grand scale. By the late 19th century Glasgow was an industrial powerhouse known as the Second\nCity of the British Empire. It built a quarter of all locomotives in use anywhere in the world and a similar proportion of global shipping. Many of the city's architectural masterpieces, such as the City Chambers on George Square, date back to this period of economic\nprestige.\nYet it is in the last two centuries that Glasgow has seen more change than in all its long\nprevious history. It was one of the first cities in the world to experience the profound\nshocks of modernity as the Industrial Revolution led to its rapid expansion and a swelling\npopulation. Life expectancy for Glaswegians in the 1850s was just over 25 years.\nThe city entered the 20th century as one of the most densely populated in Europe, with\na population peaking at 1.1 million. 200,000 of its citizens served in the First World War,\nwith many thousands being killed or returning to Glasgow with physical and psychological injuries.\nThe city played a major role in the Second World War too. However, Glasgow experienced the twin shocks of very rapid de-industrialisation and population loss in the years that followed. Traditional industries were lost and unemployment rose.\nBy the late 1940s and early 1950s, many families moved out of the crowded city to live in\nnearby new towns. Those who were left were often housed in groups of high rise flats that\nquickly lost their initial attraction and became associated with urban blight and crime. The\ncity's population dramatically reduced to half its previous level by the 1990s.\nAs a result, Glasgow's people have experienced chronic levels of stress which have\nproduced profound disparities in income, health and opportunity. The most recent profile of our population's wellbeing shows the extent of the impact of the chronic stresses. Glasgow continues to have the poorest life expectancy in Scotland for both men and women, rich and poor. These are some of the issues to which our resilience strategy is very much directed.\nFor some cities, a narrative of managed economic decline would have ensued from such\nstress. Not for Glasgow. The city took steps to diversify its economy and build a more\nattractive place for families. At the centre of this approach were the city's world class\nmuseums and galleries, together with one of the most vibrant artistic and cultural sectors\nanywhere in Europe. Glasgow has highlighted its architectural assets, promoted its sporting credentials, and drawn on its strong further and higher education sector. Above all, the city has always regarded its communities as its most important asset and in 2013 adopted a new brand to reflect this: People Make Glasgow.\nThe city's economy has developed and changed, from a carbon-intensive manufacturing\nbase in the 19th century to a modern city focused on a low-carbon future. Population loss\nhas been halted and the city's population is now expected to grow by 15% by 2037. This is in no small part due to Glasgow being an attractive place in which people choose to make their lives. As a result, Glasgow is the most ethnically diverse city in Scotland.\nThe city was tested once again in the recession brought about by the financial collapses of 2007\/08, which it has weathered with significantly lower losses in production and economic activity than in previous downturns.\nIn 2014, the city was the proud host of the Commonwealth Games and, along with other major events that year, Glasgow was seen on television by one third of the entire world population.\nDuring our conversations with Glaswegians on what makes Glasgow a resilient city we found\nthat they like to talk of their \u2018bounceback-ability' factor - an ability to cope and even thrive\nthrough hard times. Our history of resilience and transformation is testament to that. This is why People Make Glasgow Resilient.\nAs the biggest city in Scotland, Glasgow is the economic engine and main commercial\nhub not only for the region but the country as a whole. With almost half of population of\nthe entire country entire living within an hour of the city, the resilience of our institutions,\neconomy, people and infrastructure is not only of local importance. Our resilience plays a crucial role regionally as well as nationally.\nThe most diverse population in Scotland with 1 in 7 Glaswegians coming from an ethnic minority background.\nThe largest student population in Scotland with 5 degree awarding institutions and 3 super colleges. We educate over 130,000 students each year.\nWe have over 3,500 hectares of green space and 91 public parks.\n17 billion GVA generated to the Scottish economy each year.\nEmployment levels are currently growing at 3.4% a year.\nA population that is expected to grow rapidly by 15% over the next 20 years.\n58% of residents live within 500m of vacant and derelict land.\n13% of adults hold no formal qualification.\nA violent crime rate that is twice the national average.\n36% of households experience fuel poverty, a growing trend.\nRESILIENCE IN ACTION\nOUR RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nThis strategy brings together aspects of Glasgow City Council's Strategic Plan, the Glasgow\nCommunity Planning Partnership's Single Outcome Agreement, the Poverty Leadership Panel's strategy to tackle poverty, and Glasgow's proposed City Development Plan. By aligning our strategic pillars to this policy context, we ensure the Resilience Strategy is integrated into an existing framework and adds value to the city. The following diagram visualises the relationship between Glasgow's strategic objectives and our four pillars of resilience.\nSTRATEGIC PILLARS OF RESILIENCE\nThe objectives of a broad range of city wide strategies, initiatives and actions are crucial for the development of our urban resilience. Our strategic pillars and indeed the city vision, have been designed to pull existing initiatives together so that these work together in a whole-systems approach.\nThe image below shows some of the partnerships and strategies that have been recognised as playing a crucial role on our journey to greater resilience. These were identified by our\ncity partners during early preliminary resilience assessment activity. It is by no means an\nexhaustive list.\nBy working with our city partners, we will take a whole-systems approach that embeds longterm resilience thinking into existing national, regional and local strategies and initiatives. This will reinforce structural connections and delivery mechanisms between this strategy and the initiatives being delivered elsewhere in the city, meaning that our overall approach to resilience building activity is strengthened. This will also help us to monitor and track the delivery of this strategy.\nThis is an agile strategy. The actions contained within this document are short-term and have been developed as iterative interventions that will help us to connect existing strategies and initiatives through the application of a resilience lens.\nThese actions will be refreshed again in 2018 to ensure the strategy remains current in a city that is constantly transforming. All of our goals and actions are summarised in the strategy action plan. Some feature goals and actions are explained in full here in this strategy\nGlasgow's strategic context is sophisticated and well developed. Partners are generally agreed that the city has a good reputation and state of preparedness for dealing with sudden shocks, managed through the city's long-standing Resilience Unit and our emergency services. The city maintains a risk register for its key assets and regularly engages in emergency planning exercises.\nAttention has therefore focused on the chronic stresses over long time periods\nto which the city and its people have been subject - in particular those relating to poverty and inequality - and how best to address these over the coming\ndecades. Once we started this conversation and talked more with our partners\nabout resilience it became clear that these are the issues which are regarded\nlocally as really significant challenges and have naturally emerged as the\nfoundation of our strategy.\nBy further considering how potential shocks and stresses could impact on our\ncity, we have been identifying how our existing capacity can be strengthened.\nThe examples on the next page highlight just some of the work that is already effecting\nchange for people, places, institutions and the economy across the city. In preparing this\nResilience Strategy, we identified opportunities to build on what we're already doing and set out a strategic direction to address our challenges in the longer term. We evaluated these opportunities in terms of the resilience benefits they would bring for Glaswegians in addition to the feasibility of implementation. This has allowed us to reach the pillars, goals and actions outlined in this strategy.\nCHALLENGE\nCHALLENGE\nEXISTING ACTION\nEXISTING ACTION\nLISTENING TO GLASWEGIANS\nA key aspect of Glasgow's resilience work has been engagement with a wide range of both\ninstitutional stakeholders and residents. This has taken place in order to determine what they regard as the city's resilience priorities and to build ownership and commitment towards a strategy that addresses them. Workshops have been held and provided with facilitation by Glasgow's Strategy Partner Arup. A Steering Group, chaired by the city's Chief Resilience\nOfficer, has also been established to consider in further detail the materials generated by\nthese workshops.\nWe engaged in a wide-ranging Resilient Glasgow conversation with local people in the summer of 2015. Activity was promoted through social media and tailored communications designed to reach out to specific groups of people. Collaboration took place with public\nhealth researchers, council officers, change practitioners, artists and professional facilitators in order to foster high levels of participation and active dialogue in the city's resilience conversation.\nThe engagement process consisted of the following:\n\u2022 Face-to-face conversations - These took place through the use of interactive techniques which included street games, participative art and public installations. The Resilient Glasgow team visited 15 locations over 25 days, speaking with over 1,500 people. People expressed their views by drawing and writing messages on blackboards and telling their stories to officers from the Resilient Glasgow team. Over 500 responses were received.\n\u2022 Targeted workshops - 12 workshops were held with nine stakeholder groups, including the Glasgow Disability Alliance; West of Scotland Racial Equality Council; Interfaith Glasgow; Glasgow Homelessness Network and the City Mission. Workshops were facilitated using an exercise called \u2018The Glasgow Game', which uses role play to explore the complexities of resilience through different future scenarios. Over 300 participants attended.\n\u2022 On-line survey - Over 100 members of the public responded to a detailed online survey about the draft themes of Glasgow's initial resilience plans. The survey was designed to interrogate the themes and to generate opportunities for new thinking which could be incorporated into the next phase of work.\nOUR RESILIENT GLASGOW STRATEGY\n29\nGLASGOW'S STRATEGIC PILLARS, GOALS AND ACTIONS\nAt the foundation of this strategy is a commitment to embedding resilience thinking\ninto existing realms of work that support the delivery of our vision. This will mean\nthat the policies and plans that have informed the development of this strategy will\nbecome delivery vehicles that strengthen our approach.\nThe diagnostic work undertaken during the development of our Resilience Strategy\nhas led to four strategic pillars, which provide the long-term overarching framework\nthrough which we will deliver our vision for a Resilient Glasgow. Each pillar is defined by a number of goals.\nPILLAR 1\nWE WILL:\nEMPOWER GLASWEGIANS\nGOAL A GOAL B\nGOAL C GOAL D\nImprove equitable access to quality local services that foster wellbeing.\nEmpower community leaders through cooperation between city partners and the third sector.\nUse existing assets to create healthy, safe and inclusive spaces for the\ncommunity to network, helping to mitigate social isolation\nInfluence the Scottish Government agenda on social and community\nresilience.\nPILLAR 2\nWE WILL:\nUNLOCK PLACE-BASED SOLUTIONS\nGOAL A\nGOAL B GOAL C\nCreate an integrated resilience exemplar in the north of the city.\nTackle the local impacts of global climate change.\nUnlock the community, environmental and economic potential of derelict and vacant sites in Glasgow.\nPILLAR 3\nWE WILL:\nINNOVATE TO SUPPORT FAIR ECONOMIC GROWTH\nGOAL A\tSupport new urban solutions, business development and new technology ideas.\nGOAL B\tThrough a \u2018New Approach to Enterprise' support new and existing\nbusinesses to grow.\nGOAL C\tInitiate a post-industrial city sub-group with our 100RC partners to share\nand learn from best practice.\nGOAL D Tackle poverty, including in-work poverty and In Work Progression, and create meaningful work for Glaswegians.\nGOAL E\tContinue to increase the skill levels of Glasgow's working age population.\nPILLAR 4\nWE WILL:\nFOSTER CIVIC PARTICIPATION\nGOAL A\nGOAL B\nBuild capacity among citizens and decision-makers, enabling them to apply resilience thinking to their daily work and lives.\nIdentify the opportunities for resilience building associated with devolution of powers to and from the city council.\nSTRATEGIC PILLAR 1\nEMPOWERING GLASWEGIANS\nif\nEducated and engaged communities\nare an untapped asset for building resilience\nParticipant from the West of Scotland Regional Equalities Council at the Resilient Glasgow Glasgow Game\nGlasgow is a diverse city. It is also a city of inequality. We want to create a fairer, more equal society that is resilient to a range of potential futures.\nThe education of all Glaswegians is central to the development of a resilient city. Learning and development empowers the growth of more resilient people, individually and collectively. This includes community learning support and interventions as well as the education of our children and young people.\nThe existing education system is geared towards the delivery of an inclusive and holistic\ncurriculum that maintains a breadth in the range of subject areas covered, whilst also\nbuilding solid foundations for later specialisation. The principles of personalisation, choice,\nchallenge and progression are vital to the development of flexible and capable global\ncitizens.\nThe link between poverty and deprivation and educational attainment is well known. We will support our education partners to continue building successful and resilient schools that serve the needs of our more deprived communities and work to reduce child poverty and its impact on attainment.\nIt is also our belief that a fairer Glasgow is a city where partners work in collaboration to\nstrengthen the entire city. Our aspiration is to have open and transparent relationships\nbetween communities and the institutions that serve them. Autonomous and resourceful\ncommunities are crucial for a more resilient city and we want to empower all Glaswegians to be able to shape the future of their neighbourhoods.\nWe will promote the delivery of innovative initiatives that engage communities with the coordination of decisions affect their future. The ability for community groups to participate in conversations about how budgets are allocated and resources managed is one that requires us to re-examine existing ways of working. Through the Glasgow Community Planning Partnership, and in line with our aspiration to facilitate the growth of cooperative businesses and social enterprises, we are reflecting on the relationships we must develop in order to build skills and confidence within our communities. The Community Empowerment Act (Scotland) 2015 provides further opportunities for community groups to influence how spaces and assets are programmed for public use. We will examine the potential as well as the legislative implications for devolving power for communities to utilise and grow their existing sources of resilience.\nThis strategic pillar also recognises that Glaswegians are our greatest asset when dealing\nwith a challenge. The social support provided is unpaid and voluntary, relying on the good\nwill of our neighbours and friends. We believe the investment and commitment from\nindividuals through formal and informal volunteering is a good mark of urban resilience in\nGlasgow. With this in mind, we will support the delivery of initiatives that help us to broaden our volunteering capacity across the entire city.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nGlasgow will be a city where all citizens have access to high quality services that foster\nwellbeing.\nThis will increase the flexibility and adaptability of our local communities and strengthen their ability deal with new and existing challenges. It will also promote engaged communities and ensure the continuity of critical services.\nDescription: We will work with businesses and local community groups to map the availability of important local services and identify where there may be service gaps. Using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) we will work with communities to analyse this data against a selection of social indicators to determine whether services are being appropriately delivered. This information will be made available to our partners, social enterprises and start-ups to assist\nthe development of new solutions that target these gaps.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016 - 2018\nDescription: Business continuity plans are designed to ensure services are able to operate and recover quickly when they are affected by shocks - such as flooding - and stresses - such as increasing demand for services. These plans are typically\nprepared by individual organisations, with only limited consultation and coordination between service providers whose operations affect others. To ensure improved integration across critical organisations and reduced risk of cascading failures from one service to another which could affect people and businesses, we will identify the national, regional and local functions that are most critical and convene a cross-sector working group to stress test the existing business continuity plans and take steps to integrate them, with the objective to ensure that critical services remain functional and accessible,\nregardless of future circumstances.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2017 - 2018\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nGlasgow will be a city with strong collaborative capacity for capitalising on opportunities to connect new and existing models that support societal resilience. By strengthening our shared vision through shared leadership, we will foster stronger community pride, better support vulnerable people and improve access to well-paid and rewarding employment. This will help us to address the social and material dimensions of poverty and deprivation with a long-term reduction in health and economic inequalities and improved integrated governance.\nDescription: Local people are experts on what is needed to make their neighbourhoods\nthrive. We want to understand how to engage with people at a neighbourhood level to build on positive assets, address inequality and increase opportunity. There are a number of high impact initiatives in Glasgow that focus on\ndeveloping community resilience at a local level. We want to understand how\nthese pockets of excellent practice can be extended beyond the current reach for the benefit of all communities. We will analyse case studies and university-led research to develop our knowledge in this area. Where we learn from\nthis best practice, we will roll this out to develop grassroots leaders who are\nempowered to make important decisions that benefit local communities. We\nwill develop briefings for third sector support to Glasgow's community leaders and development workers. Timescale: Short Term - 2016 - 2017\nDescription: Robust volunteering networks leverage social capital and enhance community\ncohesion, both qualities required for societal resilience.\nWe will apply a resilience lens to the strategic volunteering charter to help\ndefine how the resilience drivers can be better connected to deliver a more\nimpactful approach. The strategic volunteering charter will outline the\nframework by which the city will enhance and support volunteers over the\ncoming years. Particular areas of focus will feature around individuals in\npoverty, those affected by early years' childcare challenges and young people\nwho require support on their path towards full and fulfilling employment jobs\nwhere pay and conditions can sustain us and our families and enable us to\nbuild and live our lives. Increasing these levels of \u2018work and worth' will support activities that provide intergenerational, communication and confidence building skills and other essential skills to support paid employment. The social skills earned in this way are widely recognised and the social cohesion that they generate across communities and cities must be fully defined to demonstrate the importance of volunteering work.\nThe charter will specifically outline work of the Strategic Volunteering\nFramework Group, and align with the \u201cCase for Change\u201d national document.\nWe need to enhance and support existing multi-agency forums to enrich and\ndevelop volunteering networks in the city. This will include encouraging city\nstakeholders and in particular employers to allow their staff time to volunteer.\nThis will also seek to address challenges and obstacles to volunteering,\nensuring work with communities to enhance existing activity.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016\nExpand with narrative. - helping national agenda, benefiting from City Deal, delivering for\nScotland and UK\nSTRATEGIC PILLAR 2\nUNLOCKING PLACE BASED SOLUTIONS\nThe City Development Plan (CDP) will, once adopted, play a central role in guiding the\ndelivery of a place based approach to improving personal, community and economic\nresilience. The LDP has been informed by and aligns with the Strategic Plan objectives and promotes a policy framework that gives priority to achieving successful placemaking.\nA Resilient Glasgow is a city that has the potential to transform itself. A number of significant place-based priorities are helping us along this journey. These include the delivery of the \u00a31.13 billion City Deal for Glasgow, the development of the Sighthill Transformation Regeneration Area (TRA), the Single Outcome Agreement's Thriving Places initiative as well as other Housing, City Centre and Canal Regenerations. Both programmes will deliver massive resilience dividends through the implementation of major infrastructure, innovation and labour market projects.\nOur approach to improving the critical infrastructure of our city is underpinned by our\nambition to be the most sustainable city in Europe. Through the implementation of\nplace-based solutions, we seek to become more resilient to the changing environmental\nconditions that threaten to undermine our physical and social integrity. In particular, we want to achieve:\n\u2022 A low carbon footprint and improved air quality\n\u2022 Connected transport infrastructure for businesses and communities\n\u2022 Accessible, affordable and green ways for communities to move about Glasgow\n\u2022 An energy efficient future\n\u2022 Investment and jobs within local communities\n\u2022 Good access to physical and digital infrastructure\nWe will build on the success of exemplar partnerships that are already delivering\nprogrammes and will increase our capacity to cope with climate change. These include the Canal Partnership, the Metropolitan Glasgow Strategic Drainage Partnerships (MGSDP), Glasgow and Clyde Valley Green Network Partnership (GCVGN) and the Climate Ready Clyde initiative.\nWe focus our attention on bringing together businesses, communities, artists, technical\nexperts and academic specialists in a joined up effort to build awareness and facilitate the\ndevelopment of an integrated climate change adaptation plan.\nWe recognise that informed, design above and below ground is essential for resilient\ndevelopment particularly as much of the ageing infrastructure\/networks are underground.\nThis will give us opportunities as well as challenges. Furthermore, this theme also addresses issues of public safety and security, by considering how the design of public spaces can deter crime and anti-social behaviour, and how emergency services and the community sector can help to manage public safety risks in an integrated way.\nThe implementation of the new CDP is crucial for the continued development of societal\nand economic resilience in Glasgow. Our new plan will provide a concise framework for the delivery of sustainable, vibrant and distinctive places that are well-designed, safe, healthy and inclusive, contributing towards improving health and wellbeing as well as encouraging future investment\nTo help us deliver on this strategic pillar, we will focus our immediate attention towards the development of resilience in the north of the city. We will develop an approach to resilience building that then inform similar work with communities in other parts of Glasgow.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nThe community, environmental and economic potential of derelict and vacant sites in\nGlasgow will be unlocked. By using 3D modelling to map vacant and derelict land we will be able to de-risk development by identifying new opportunities above and below ground. This will promote development opportunities associated with sites in order to attract developers and promote economic regeneration, compact city development and appropriate services.\nDescription: We will develop spatial supplementary guidance that integrates the drivers and qualities of resilience. This will help us ensure that we consider the longterm integrity of our city as business as usual. We recognise that one unit of planning will reduce response actions by between four and seven units of\nexpenditure. Our approach will reduce future requirements to address physical vulnerabilities through costly retrospective action.\nThis action will increase stakeholder visibility of what is happening in the north\nof Glasgow, enabling the coordination of impactful decision\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016 - 2018\nCreating a more robust, inclusive and integrated city through integrated planning.\nIn 2007 Glasgow won its bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and began 7 years of planning for the \u2018Best Games Ever'. Underpinning the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games was our ambition to create a more flourishing, active, connected and sustainable Scotland.\nThe Games were an opportunity to bring vitality into areas of the city that had suffered most\nduring an extended period of deindustrialisation and population decline - in particular the\nEast End of the city.\nThe multi-agency partner Clyde Gateway was established to manage the regeneration\nefforts in the East End. Partnering agencies consulted intensively with local communities\nto build on community strengths and maximise social benefits. These regeneration efforts\nincluded new roads infrastructure, refurbished existing venues and the new Emirates Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. One of the biggest success stories is the Athletes Village.\nConstruction work on the Athletes' village began in June 2011. During the Games, the\nvillage provided accommodation and facilities for 6,500 competitors and officials. Following the Games, the properties were retrofit to transform the village to offer 700 affordable new homes, including 400 homes for social rent and a new 120 bed care home for the elderly.\nThe development is one of the most significant new urban housing developments in the\nUK and was constructed to the highest (BREEAM Excellent) environmental standards. Now\nan exemplar \u2018eco-village', residents benefit from living in flood resilient properties, energy\nefficient properties, a Combined Heat and Power Energy Centre which provides hot water to\nall properties, sustainable and accessible green space and improved transportation links to the area.\nThrough the ERDF URBACT III Resilient Europe project, we will work with local agencies\nand communities in the Possilpark neighbourhood of Glasgow to develop an integrated\nlocal action plan for building resilience. We will build on the Thriving Places initiative with\na particular focus on the environmental, social and economic challenges being faced by\nthe local community. We will develop an approach that can then be rolled out to other communities and neighbourhoods in Glasgow.\nThis activity will help us to develop increased collaborative capacity between communities\nand institution. We will want to empower communities through the development of a greater understand of local resilience pressures and opportunities.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nGlasgow will be more resilient in the face of climate change risks. We will foster long-term\nand integrated planning that empowers communities and promotes local leadership. We\nwill take advantage of climate change threat as an opportunity to enhance our natural and manmade assets, improving quality of life for all Glaswegians. We will seek opportunities to invest in integrated infrastructure projects that increase social justice whilst providing local communities with new skills and employment opportunities.\nDescription: Sustainable water management solutions - such as open channels, ponds and\nrain gardens for storing and treating surface water - can offer practical benefits\nfor reducing flood risk locally and further downstream whilst providing a level\nof water treatment. They also provide as social, economic and environmental advantages for communities and people. If managed well, they can be an\naesthetic and amenity feature for communities and can improve local property values compared with a heavily engineered drainage solution. This green infrastructure is a shift from the drainage infrastructure of the past, which aimed to remove water quickly to drains and sewers below ground. There is therefore a cultural shift to be achieved to ensure that developers and citizens in Glasgow recognise the value of green infrastructure solutions and are able to maximise the amenity value of new green and blue spaces in the city. To find ways for Glasgow's communities to get the most out of the water management solutions we are being implemented throughout the city, Glasgow will engage with the wider network of 100RC cities to gather best practice guidance and learning from successful existing projects around the world.\nTimescale: Short-term 2016\nDescription: As the local climate changes over time, Glasgow's buildings and infrastructure\nwill need to withstand shifting conditions including changes in temperature\nand rainfall, and more extreme weather. As many of the city's existing buildings will still be standing in 30 years and more, they must be able to adapt to climate trends and future impacts. A climate ready design guidance scheme will help designers and developers to design new buildings and infrastructure to respond to anticipated future conditions, and to retrofit existing buildings to cope with these changes too. The guidance will particularly take into account the heritage buildings that we have throughout Glasgow, which are an important part of our local identity and an attraction to visitors, but which\npresent particular challenges for future proofing.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2018 - 2019\nUPGRADING OUR DRAINAGE INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMODATE\nSEVERE RAINFALL EVENTS\nThe Metropolitan Glasgow Strategic Drainage Partnership (MGSDP - www.mgsdp.org) is\ncollaborative partnership between local authorities, the Scottish Environment Protection\nAgency, Scottish Water, Scottish Enterprise, Clyde Gateway and Scottish Canals. The Vision\nis to transform how the city region thinks about and manages rainfall to end uncontrolled\nflooding and improve water quality. The partnership seeks to upgrade and modernise the Glasgow area's drainage and sewerage network, reducing flooding and improving the\nquality of our river water. The initiative plays an important role in contributing to economic\ndevelopment whilst improving our natural environment and integrating investment\nplanning.\nSince 2002, the MGSDP has developed efficient and robust systems that have helped to:\n\u2022 Significantly reduce the risk and impacts of flooding to over 7,000 properties\n\u2022\tProtect hundreds of homes and businesses through various flood prevention schemes\n\u2022\tInvest over \u00a3150million to reduce the risk and impacts of sewer flooding and improve water quality\n\u2022 Improve and protect the natural environment of the region\nThe MGSDP partners will continue to make significant investment in the coming years to\ncontinue to deliver the Vision through the MGSDP Guiding Principles (following page).\nSTRATEGIC PILLAR 3\nINNOVATING FOR FAIR ECONOMIC GROWTH\nGlasgow has weathered a massive\neconomic transition and we must\nmake sure we are prepared for future challenges\nParticipant from the West of Scotland Regional Equalities Council at the Resilient Glasgow Glasgow Game\nThe recession has been one of the most significant stresses to have challenged the\neconomy of our city. It has had a real impact on the city, testing the resilience of our people, businesses and organisations. Despite facing one of the most serious economic recessions of all time, we successfully hosted the \u2018Best Games Ever', the Commonwealth Games 2014. Confronting one of the most significant stresses to have challenged our resilience, we\nembraced an opportunity that would deliver a real economic impact for the city and catalyse positive change for the lives of Glaswegians.\nA resilient Glasgow confronts adversity to be a city of prosperity that provides a high quality of life for all. Our future city is a centre of innovation, production and culture. It is also a city that offers Glaswegians a good quality of life. We will support the development of economic interventions that enhance the strength of our communities.\nThrough the Single Outcome Agreement, which maps out our shared priorities for partners in the city, we will work with our community planning partners to continue maintain a key focus that addresses youth unemployment. We will work with economic development\nstructures and our educational systems to ensure that our children and young people\nare sufficiently developed in a way that prepares them with the skills required by our\ncommunities and businesses. We will support businesses to take advantage of and grow\nfrom the assets, skills and enthusiasm of our young people.\nAt the same time, we will support the delivery of digital skills to not only consume services\nbut to be the producers of new goods and services, harnessing the potential of digital\ntechnologies to drive growth, stimulate innovation and improve productivity\nGlasgow is the economic centre for Scotland and we want to compete with other cities in\nScotland and the wider UK. We have a strong and well-developed service based economy\nand we want to further diversify our economic model. We will do this by attracting and\nretaining a diversity of successful business that will secure long-term economic resilience.\nAt the same time we will develop the economic resilience of individual new businesses,\nsupporting them through the entire business cycle from start-up through to growth and\nmaturity.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nWe believe the personal resilience of Glaswegians is inextricably linked to availability of\nmeaningful and fulfilling employment. By supporting initiatives that increase the economic\ngrowth of Glasgow we will support livelihoods and employment, increase the sense of worth\nwithin communities. By fostering economic prosperity, we will unlock barriers that prevent Glaswegians from finding employment that is personally and socially rewarding.\nDescription: Open data is an enabler for greater resilience. It accelerates innovation between community groups, partners and entrepreneurs. This action will allow for the coordination of well informed decisions that can facilitate economic growth in a way that delivers social and environmental benefits. Building on the success of the Future City Glasgow initiative, we will bring together communities and businesses with partners who are currently working on the development of\nsmart, digital interventions. Through increased collaborative capacity, we seek to navigate the challenges associated with the opening of data sets within the city.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016 - 2017\nDescription: Over the next two years, Glasgow will hold five challenges for entrepreneurs and start-ups, which will equate to 100 days in total. We want to build on our reputation as a centre of creativity and innovation, allowing skills and capacity to emerge from Glaswegians to define the shape of our future economic activity. We will also host a series of youth hackathons that supporting the development of our young people and identify new smart solutions that we can use to\naddress specific resilience challenges.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016 - 2017\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nGlasgow will share lessons and experience that can be used to develop resilience amongst\npartner cities. We will develop an understanding that will inform our approach to the chronic stresses that are associated with a post-industrial legacy. We will develop new ways for stimulating entrepreneurial activity, approaches to developing circular economy activity and different strategies for people centred design. This goal will increase resilience across all of the dimensions of the City Resilience Framework.\nDescription: We will initiate a sub-group with 100RC, inviting relevant post-industrial cities to participate. Glasgow will chair initial meetings. Topics for exploration include local economic pressures, business continuity planning, unemployment and\ncrime and vandalism. Glasgow will chair the first meeting of the post-industrial\ncity sub-group.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016\nINTEGRATED AND RESOURCEFUL LEADERSHIP FOR ROBUST ECONOMIC\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe Glasgow Economic Leadership (GEL) was established in 2011 to provide independent\nleadership and direction to economic development activity in Glasgow and to champion\nthe implementation of the recommendations made by the Glasgow Economic Commission. The Group, chaired by Professor Sir Jim McDonald, acts as a senior advisory body to the City Council but also to national bodies like Scottish Enterprise and Skills Development Scotland, which have investments to make in the growth of the city of Glasgow.\nSTRATEGIC PILLAR 4\nFOSTERING CIVIC PARTICIPATION\nWe are proud of our trusted institutions and will build upon them to ensure a fair and\nequitable approach towards all Glaswegians. We will encourage and support a resilient vision at the heart of every public facing institution to ensure we are strong for the future.\nGlasgow's success is reliant on the systems and institutions that deliver services. To ensure\nthe city runs smoothly, it is essential that Glaswegians receive the support and services\nthey need and that these services are targeted appropriately. These critical services and\nsystems are delivered by a broad range of public institutions - including Glasgow City\nCouncil, the NHS, Scottish and UK government departments and agencies, Further and Higher education institutions, as well as the third sector, and the commercial sector. The\napproach, objectives, responsibilities and scope of operation of these organisations do not\nalways reflect the boundaries and priorities of Glasgow - but may be set by wider agendas. These organisations are challenged on a daily basis by shifting macroeconomic trends or economic pressures.\nThere is no getting away from the fact that these are difficult times for Glasgow. Through the Transforming Glasgow programme, we are reshaping the way services are delivered to better meet the needs of Glaswegians. The focus is on developing more resilient service\ndelivery mechanisms that are fit for purpose, agile and responsive in the context of financial challenges, legislative changes and city priorities.\nA collaborative approach is essential to improve the targeting and quality of services - with an improved understanding of gaps and the critical linkages and dependencies between\ndifferent organisations and services. A relevant example is the current review of social and health care to deliver a more joined up and efficient service.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nGlaswegians will understand the challenges the city is facing and have the information they need in order to make smart and informed decisions now, and to plan for long-term\nchallenges.\nFEATURED ACTION 4.A.4. Pilot a city Resilience Dashboard.\nDescription: We will develop a digital online dashboard that illustrates and connects resilience initiatives that are taking place across Glasgow. This dashboard will link into our Open Glasgow platform and will build on the principles of making data open, transparent and visually usable. The dashboard will be used to\ncollate data, showcase success, share learning and monitor progress. We will include a north Glasgow page that is tailored to the actions contained in this strategy.\nThis action will increase the capacity to make coordinated decisions that are\nin line with the Single Outcome Agreement and the Transforming Glasgow\nProgramme, both of which are focused on partnership working to deliver better outcomes for the people of Glasgow. An essential principle for this action is a\nsmarter use of assets.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016 - 2017\nMAKING EFFECTIVE USE OF CITY DATA THROUGH OUR FUTURE CITIES PROGRAMME\nThrough the Future City Glasgow programme, Glasgow has been exploring ways to harness the power of data and technology to make our city a better place to live, work and play. From the state-of the-art city operations centre to the creation of an innovative city data hub, Glasgow has been developing a series of initiatives to showcase the exiting potential offered by smart city technology.\nOne example that put people at the very heart of the future city was the Easterhouse\nAddictions community mapping initiative with the Greater Easterhouse Alcohol Awareness Project (GEAPP). GEAPP is a local charity whose aim is to reduce the harm associated with the use of alcohol. A key goal for GEAPP is to help the community that it serves to discover what's on and what is available within the local area; not just alcohol recovery services, but anything that can keep people in recovery active in ways that provide an alternative to the addictive behaviour.\nWorking with local communities with support from social enterprise Pidgin Perfect, and in\ncollaboration with the Glasgow Community Planning Partnership and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, a series of community mapping workshops were facilitated to map local assets and services available to people in recovery. A digitised the map was then developed,\ncreating an online tool that allowed GEAPP and volunteers to maintain a local directory of\nservices and assets.\nWhen people are in recovery it can be difficult for them to navigate the services that are\navailable. If people cannot find the services they need they can disengage from the recovery process altogether, withdrawing from the community and back into addictive behaviours. Now, with the mapping tool, those in recovery can see what is going on in their area, making it easier for them to get the access to the services they need.\nBy integrating data through local maps, this project brought together local stories with factual data in a way that enhances existing service delivery mechanisms. The resilience dividend is the creation and trust and empathy between agencies and communities.\nDescription: We understand the importance of clear and concise information sharing.\nWe understand the importance of continuous learning and that we need to document our journey for others to learn. In order to ensure a consistent and agreed approach to embed resilience through all organisations and structures. The city - through participation with the Smart Mature Resilient (SMR) Cities European Horizon 2020 project - will contribute towards the development of a resilience toolkit that provides resource and opportunities to develop and map city resilience. We will pilot and ensure the City Resilience Framework is integrated and aligned with the development of the toolkit. We understand the importance of information transfer and reducing silo thinking across city stakeholders. The development of an information exchange portal will work within suitable boundaries to create an easily accessible, easily navigated portal of city information relevant to city resilience.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016 - 2017\nDescription: We will commence this project by working with young people from our schools and colleges. Our aim is to embed a deeper understanding of resilience through our education system. By doing so we will look to increasing young people's awareness of the challenges facing Glasgow and the wider world. We believe that this greater understanding amongst young people is essential for developing our ability to respond to future shocks and stresses. To drive this knowledge and increase a sense of global citizenship among our young people, Glasgow will engage with 100RC and other cities in the 100RC network to create a schools cultural exchange programme that allows young Glaswegians\nto learn about the different resilience challenges we face.\nTimescale: Short Term - 2016 - 2017\nDELIVERING THE STRATEGY\nThe actions contained within this strategy will be delivered over an initial two year period from 2016 to 2018. After this time, the actions will be refreshed.\nThe remit of the Resilient Glasgow Steering Group is to provide directional support,\nguidance and influence on our journey to greater resilience. The Steering Group will act as a senior strategic body that will function as a multi-agency city partnership, bringing together our public sector partners, businesses, academics and voluntary organisations. The Steering Group will exist for the entire strategy implementation period.\nThe Resilient Glasgow Steering Group will report formally to various Council Committees\nand other bodies as deemed appropriate.\nSupporting the Resilient Glasgow Steering Group will be the Resilient Glasgow Forum.\nThe Resilient Glasgow Forum will consist of individuals from across the Council Family and our city partners. Members will have special interests, experience and knowledge in city resilience. The remit of the Resilient Glasgow Forum will be to:\n\u2022\tEVALUATE the progress of the Resilient Glasgow Action Plan\n\u2022\tKNIT together related or cross cutting initiatives\n\u2022\tIDENTIFY new conversations that should be had with citywide stakeholders\n\u2022\tPROMOTE the application of a resilience lens to citywide activity\n\u2022\tCONSIDER the development of local and national influences\n\u2022\tIDENTIFY new opportunities that should be pursued and integrated into our programme\n\u2022\tDISSEMINATE learning at a citywide level.\nThis strategy will be implemented with continued support and guidance from 100RC who\nwill also provide additional resources through a selection of Platform Partners. Platform Partners are a variety of creative and influential global organisations committed to supporting the development of urban resilience.\nPlatform Partners will provide us with technical skills and expertise that will lend itself to support the delivery of some of the actions contained within our strategy.\nMONITORING PROGRESS\nDELIVERING THE STRATEGY\nTo ensure we deliver on our Resilient Glasgow strategy, we are developing a MONITORING and EVALUATING FRAMEWORK. This will allow us to monitor progress through data sets available from our city partners. This in turn will allow partners to appreciate the role their targets play in developing city resilience. In developing the Framework, we are taking\naccount of:\n\u2022\tOur particular resilience challenges and the goals\/actions outlined in the strategy.\n\u2022\tThe data that is routinely collected by partners in the NHS, Scottish Government,\nGlasgow City Council and elsewhere to promote a resilience culture across services and\norganisations in the city.\n\u2022\tCommunication, learning and accountability. The indicators must be accessible and used reflectively by city partners and citizens to identify areas of progress or continuing challenge. For this reason, we are open to adding new indicators as the strategy develops and unfolds.\n\u2022\tAccessibility of indicators. These will be made available on the Understanding\nGlasgow website, already a popular resource in the city with a wide range of resources\n(understandingglasgow.com).\nResilience Strategy Monitoring and Evaluation Reports will be fed through our core partnership groups for information and discussion on relevant issues as they arise. These core partnership groups include the:\n\u2022\tCommunity Planning Partnership\n\u2022 Poverty Leadership Panel\n\u2022\tExtended Corporate Management Team\n\u2022\tLocal Resilience Partnership\n\u2022\tGlasgow Economic Leadership\n\u2022\tScottish Government\nResilient Glasgow Steering Group Sustainable Glasgow Board.\nBased on our outcomes, with ongoing dialogue with these core partnership groups, we will produce an Annual Resilience Statement which will articulate and include:\n\u2022 our yearly performance, with information on progress of the goals and actions\n\u2022 a narrative of our journey to greater resilience\n\u2022 emerging considerations that should be integrated into resilience practices\n\u2022 new collaborations or funding opportunities that could support the strategy implementation.\nOur Annual Resilience Statement will be reported to Glasgow City Council's Executive\nCommittee before being published for dissemination to our partners and the wider\nGlasgow public.\nMeasurement of our progress against the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework will form the basis for our Resilient Glasgow Strategy refresh in June 2018.","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["George Square","Europe","Scotland","Glasgow","East End","Possilpark","GLASGOW","Second City"],"DATE":["June 2011","late 19th century Glasgow","summer of 2015","June 2018","1940s","December 2013","2007","last two centuries","1990s","2002","2037","2011","2016","1850s","1950s","2015","19th century","20th century","2014","200708","2013","2017","2018","12","2019"],"ORGANIZATION":["Glasgow Economic Commission","Resilient Glasgow Strategy","5th Century","ERDF URBACT III Resilient Europe","Scottish Environment Protection Agency","City Development Plan","Scottish Government","Glasgow 's Strategy Partner Arup","Resilience Strategy","VALUE Glasgow","Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games","Commonwealth Games","Commonwealth Games 2014","Steering Group","Future City Glasgow","GVA","City Council","City Chambers","Glasgow City Council 's Executive Committee","Climate Ready Clyde","Glasgow City Council","Glasgow","Council Family","Glasgow Disability Alliance ;

The strength and texture of our city, and what makes\nit unique, is the people\u2014the innovators, artists, activists, students, public\nservants, and families\u2014young and old, who call Berkeley home. Our community's resilience rests on our people and our ability to live well in good times and bounce back stronger than ever from the inevitable hard times.\nDeveloped with input and insights from the people of Berkeley,\nthe Resilience Strategy is designed to articulate solutions that\nmake our city more resilient not only to physical challenges, such\nas earthquakes, sea level rise, and aging infrastructure, but also to\nsocial challenges, such as racial inequity. At its core, the Resilience\nStrategy is about building resilience by building community. Strong\nconnections between neighbors and lasting partnerships between\ncommunity-serving organizations are vital to helping all residents,\nespecially those most in need and historically underserved, to thrive.\nBerkeley's Resilience Strategy is the launch point for several programs\nthat foster these connections and partnerships. One of these programs\nthat I am excited about is the new Community Resilience Center Program, which will enable several community-based organizations, in partnership with the City, to serve as hosts for training and conduits to disaster\npreparedness, public health, and other services that are tailored to the\nneeds of the people the organizations serve. This program is a good\nexample of what the practice of resilience looks like\u2014it addresses more\nthan one challenge at once and creates multiple benefits for many people.\nI am proud of the many partnerships\nthat have made the Resilience\nStrategy possible, and I look for-\nward to forming many additional\npartnerships that will enable its\nimplementation. 100 Resilient Cities\n(100RC)\u2014Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation\u2014has provided\ninvaluable support, guidance, and access to technical assistance. Our neighboring cities\u2014Oakland and San Francisco\u2014are also participating in 100RC, and continued collaboration in the region will help to amplify our work beyond the boundaries of our respective cities.\nMost of all, I am grateful to the Berkeley community for contributing to the Resilience Strategy and for what you do every day to make Berkeley the active, dynamic, and highly engaged community that it is. I invite all community members to review this report with\nan eye towards how you can join your friends, neighbors, and\ncolleagues in making Berkeley a model of city resilience.\nSincerely,\nDee Williams-Ridley City Manager\nIntroduction and Purpose\nIn 2014 the City of Berkeley (City), along with our neighboring cities of\nOakland and San Francisco, was one of the first 32 cities selected to\nparticipate in 100 Resilient Cities (100RC)\u2014Pioneered by The Rockefeller\nFoundation. 100RC helps cities around the world build resilience to\nthe social, economic, and physical challenges of the 21st century.\nA city's resilience is defined by the ability of the individuals,\ninstitutions, businesses, and systems within the community to\nsurvive, adapt, and grow no matter what chronic stress or acute\nshock it experiences. A resilient city lives well in good times\nand bounces back quickly and strongly from hard times.\nThe City conducted extensive research that included community outreach and engagement to develop a strategy that is designed to advance Berkeley's resilience. Building on existing efforts and with guidance from the Mayor, the City Council, and the community, the Berkeley Resilience Strategy identifies six long-term goals and recommends specific shortterm actions to help address some of Berkeley's most pressing challenges.\nBerkeley's Interconnected Resilience Challenges\nEarthquakes\nAs residents of Berkeley and the Bay Area region well know, one of the\nmost pressing challenges we face is natural disasters. Given our proximity to several faults, including the Hayward Fault, which runs directly through the city, Berkeley is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Current\nBerkeley residents are likely to experience a major earthquake in their\nlifetime. In the event of a major earthquake, over 600 housing units would be destroyed and 20,000 more would be damaged. Approximately 3,000\nto 12,000 households would be displaced. Low-income housing units are\nexpected to be damaged at the highest rate. Businesses would also be\ndestroyed. And the energy and water infrastructure of the various utilities would likely be disrupted for several days or weeks. The economic impact in Berkeley would be in the billions of dollars, and much more in the region as whole. Every aspect of the city, including its people, historic places,\nand economic prosperity, could be quickly and dramatically altered.\nWildfires\nBerkeley and the East Bay have a history of destructive wildfire in\nthe eastern hills. The wildfire risk in the hills is compounded by the\narea's narrow streets, which limit access and egress routes. This risk\nwas clearly demonstrated in the 1991 Tunnel Fire, which destroyed\nentire neighborhoods in Berkeley and Oakland and took the lives\nof 25 people. In 1923, an even bigger fire burned through Berkeley,\ndestroying nearly 600 structures. If a fire burned that same area\ntoday, approximately 3,000 structures would be destroyed, including\nmany small businesses, single-family homes, and apartment buildings,\nparticularly buildings that house university students. The risk of wild-\nfire is aggravated by California's severe and prolonged drought.\nClimate Change Impacts: Drought and Flooding\nDue to climate change, longer periods of drought are expected to\nbe the new normal for our city, region, and state. This Resilience\nStrategy was developed in the midst of one of the most severe,\nmulti-year droughts in the state's history. In addition to increased\nwildfire risk, the impacts of drought include higher food prices and\nsignificant stress on Berkeley's urban forest and ecosystems.\nINTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE\nOn the other end of the spectrum, climate change is also causing more\nfrequent and severe flooding, especially in West Berkeley, which is the part of the city closest to the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Bay water levels are rising and are forecast to continue to increase at an accelerating rate throughout the 21st century. In combination with more unpredictable and extreme rain events, sea level rise is exacerbating the limits of Berkeley's aging stormwater system, which is degrading due to decades of deferred maintenance and repair and is under-capacity for today's changed climate.\nlifelines in the event of a disaster, but also lead to multi-stakeholder, multi-benefit problem solving even under normal circumstances.\nStronger connections within the community and region are criti-\ncal to achieving each of the goals identified in this Strategy:\nRacial Inequity\nIn addition to physical challenges, Berkeley also\nfaces chronic social challenges. For example,\nracial inequity exists in health outcomes, income,\nand educational attainment. Compared to White\nresidents, African American residents in Berkeley\nare three times less likely to have a college degree and two times more likely to live in poverty. African American residents in South and West Berkeley\nhave higher rates of childhood asthma hospitalizations, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes. Inequity correlates with greater\nvulnerability to physical challenges, making many\nin Berkeley disproportionately at risk from natural\ndisasters and the impacts of climate change.\nThe approach that this Strategy emphasizes is to build community resilience by building stronger connections\u2014stronger connections between neighbors; between public, private, nonprofit, and academic institutions; between departments within the City government; and between Bay Area local and regional governments.\nBuilding Berkeley's Resilience through Connectedness\nClearly, these are massive and complex challenges that no one strategy\ncan solve. But development and implementation of the Resilience Strategy is an opportunity to identify tangible steps that contribute to a solution and that emphasize an approach to resilience-building that can be further applied by the City and its community partners to other challenges moving forward. These connections not only can provide critical support and\nIn the spirit of connectedness, the Resilience Strategy is also an\ninvitation for all residents and organizations in the city to partner\nwith the City government and other community leaders to build\nBerkeley's resilience together. There is no single action we can take that solves all of Berkeley's challenges, but we can take coordinated, multi-disciplinary steps that address more than one challenge at\nonce. As you review the goals and actions articulated in this report,\nwe invite you to identify opportunities for you to benefit from and contribute to the work. We have specifically included \u201cWhat You Can Do\u201d sections throughout the document to stimulate some ideas.\nMoving forward, the City will continue to contribute to and learn from the practice of resilience that is being advanced through the 100RC Network, of which Berkeley is honored to be a part. The City will continue to foster partnerships with resilience leaders in the region, including the Cities of Oakland and San Francisco and the myriad of local resilience champions in our community.\nINTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE\nApproximately 1,100 community members contributed their insights and ideas to this Strategy\nDevelopment and implementation of the Berkeley Resilience Strategy are opportunities for the City of Berkeley government (City) and partners in the community to research and articulate some of Berkeley's most pressing resilience challenges; identify specific, multi-benefit actions that contribute to solutions to those challenges; and secure additional resources, technical assistance, and partnerships to accelerate next steps.\nThe goals and actions identified in the Berkeley Resilience Strategy are grounded in community input, expert analysis, and best practices from other cities in the global 100 Resilient Cities Network. Approximately\n1,100 community members contributed their insights and ideas through a combination of an online survey; public workshops; City Council meetings;\nCity Commission meetings; and events hosted by community-based organizations, such as the Berkeley Climate Action Coalition. Partner institutions and agencies, such as the University of California (UC), Berkeley; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL); the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG); the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC); and the Government Alliance on Race and Equity provided invaluable guidance.\nThe following research, outreach, and analysis we conducted informed the goals and specific actions identified in the Resilience Strategy.\n* Conducting seismic evaluations, economic risk analysis, and energy and water audits of six City care and shelter facilities.\n*\tEvaluating and documenting gaps in the emergency backup power infrastructure for critical City facilities and researching national best practices in advancing energy reliability.\n*\tEvaluating the efficacy of existing City disaster preparedness incentive programs.\n*\tAnalyzing how sea level rise and changing precipitation trends increase flooding and affect Berkeley neighborhoods and infrastructure.\n*\tIdentifying and evaluating potential additional stormwater management funding and financing options.\n*\tAnalyzing options for diversifying the City\u2019s water supply in the face of severe drought.\n*\tParticipating in an international exchange hosted by the City of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, focused on learning from the world\u2019s leading experts on floodwater management.\n*\tParticipating in a year-long, action-oriented training focused on identifying and eliminating institutional barriers to racial equity.\n*\tCollaborating with regional agencies, the Cities of Oakland and San Francisco, and others to identify regional resilience-building approaches.\n*\tProviding a diverse set of opportunities for community members to share input..\nAll of this work was conducted with the objective of building or improving connections between individuals and between organizations within the community and region and identifying the multi-benefit, multi-stakeholder actions that are articulated in the Resilience Strategy.\nA helpful guide throughout the process was the City Resilience Framework. Developed by Arup with support from The Rockefeller Foundation, the CRF is being used by cities in the 100RC network to guide a common understanding of and approach to the practice of building city resilience. It was drafted from extensive empirical research conducted globally and is based on four dimensions identified as being essential to urban resilience: Health and Wellbeing, Economy and Society, Infrastructure and Environment, and Leadership and Strategy. Each of the dimensions is further defined by three drivers of resilience.\nFor Berkeley, the CRF has proved to be a useful tool for identifying actions that have \u201cresilience value,\u201d meaning that they integrate multiple interests and areas of expertise, address multiple challenges; and create several co-benefits. As you review the goals in the pages that follow, note the \u201cresilience value\u201d associated with each.\nBuilding Berkeley\u2019s Resilience\nThe Berkeley Resilience Strategy is designed to advance community preparedness for some of Berkeley's most pressing physical, social, and economic challenges, examples of which are included in this timeline. The Resilience Strategy builds on and dovetails with past\n2006: Measure G Passed\nBerkeley voters passed a measure setting a target of reducing community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 80% below 2000 levels by 2050 and directing the Mayor to develop a Climate Action Plan to achieve that target\n2004: Disaster\nMitigation Plan A plan to evaluate the risks that a range of hazards pose to Berkeley and identify actions to minimize those risks\n2005: Berkeley Hills Fire Assessments\nHouse-to-house risk assessments were conducted in the Berkeley Hills through a FEMA grant to provide information to residents and vital improvements to fire evacuation pathways\n1991: Tunnel Fire\nThe fire destroyed entire neighborhoods in\nBerkeley and Oakland and took the lives of 25 people. The City has since worked to reduce wildfire vulnerability, including through improved building codes, vege-\ntation management, and coordinated training with\nother area fire personnel\n16\nplanning efforts that benefited from expert analysis and broad community engagement. Moving forward, successful Strategy implementation rests on continued community engagement and new partnerships that build Berkeley's resilience.\n2008: Measure GG Passed\nBerkeley voters approved a special tax to maintain fire station staffing and improve emergency medical response and disaster preparedness services\n2008: 2020 Vision for Berkeley\u2019s Children and Youth The City of Berkeley, Berkeley Unified School District, and other partners launched an initiative designed to, by 2020, end the racial predictability of academic achievement that exists in Berkeley public schools\n2009: Climate Action Plan\nA plan developed through extensive community input and designed to achieve deep reductions in Berkeley's greenhouse gas emissions along with other co-benefits\n2011: Watershed Management Plan\nA plan that articulates an integrated strategy for managing urban water resources, including through advancement of green infrastructure\n2007: Cosco Busan Oil Spill\nA container ship hit the Bay Bridge, spilling over 53,000 gallons of fuel oil into the San Francisco Bay and causing harm to ecosystems, including along the Berkeley coastline\n2012: Downtown Area Plan\nA plan providing guidelines\nfor future development in\nDowntown Berkeley in order\nto promote economic development, housing and community health, historic preservation,\nsustainability, and open space\n2012: Start of severe\nCalifornia drought\nCalifornia is in the midst of a\nprolonged, multi-year drought,\nwhich aggravates wildfire risk and has significant impacts on agriculture and ecosystems.

Its world class academic institutions, well-earned reputation for tolerance and inclusiveness, vibrant local economy, and access to the broader San Francisco Bay Area draw residents and visitors from all over the world. But every aspect of the city, including its people, historic places, and economic prosperity, could be quickly and dramatically altered by a catastrophic disaster, such as an earthquake or wildfire. Although we cannot predict when the next disaster will strike, as a community we are empowered to take steps now to reduce the harm disasters can cause.\nFundamental to preparedness is connectedness. The City of Berkeley (City) government and its community partners have worked for many years to provide incentives and support that advance critical connections among neighbors; between public, private, non-profit, and academic institutions; and between Bay Area local and regional governments.\nThese connections enable everyone in the Berkeley community to take part in a coordinated response and recovery effort. Importantly, these connections also help to ensure that Berkeley's most vulnerable residents have vital lifelines before, during, and after a disaster.\nThrough the dedication and relentless focus on disaster readiness that many in our community provide, Berkeley is safer and more prepared now than ever before. But our work is not done. The actions identified below are designed to build on existing efforts and to result not only in improved physical safety, but also a more tightly-knit community.\nResilience value\nThe actions identified to build a connected and prepared community are designed to result in multiple benefits, including improved physical safety, which will result in reduced loss of life and injury in the event of a disaster; increased social cohesion; increased access to services and assistance for historically underserved residents; improved environmental performance of critical City facilities; and improved ability to minimize economic disruption.\n1A . Create safe (and green)\nCity community centers and care & shelter facilities\nThe City has designated seven community and senior ce nters as care and shelter sites in the event of a disaster. These facilities, depending on the scale and nature of the event, could provide overnight sheltering, food distribution, and other services to those in need. These facilities are distributed throughout the city and, in addition to their care and shelter function, provide essential services on a daily basis to thousands of Berkeley residents, including seniors and youth, who use these facilities for hot meals, recreation, classes, and socializing.\nThe facilities are critical to our community, but they are also in critical condition. The conclusion of the seismic evaluations conducted in 2015 is that, in the event of a major earthquake, none of these seven facilities would be able to serve its daily or disaster functions without significant and costly repairs. An analysis by Risk Management Solutions (RMS) demonstrated that it is significantly more cost-effective to invest in seismic upgrades than it is to rebuild or repair structures after an earthquake. The City also conducted energy and water audits of the facilities and identified cost-effective energy- and water-saving opportunities.\nThe City will work with community partners and technical assistance providers to make multi-benefit seismic, energy, water, and operational upgrades\nto these critical community-serving facilities.\n1A\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley City Manager's Office and the Departments of Public Works; Parks, Recreation & Waterfront; Health, Housing & Community Services; and the Office of Emergency Services\nPartner(s): Risk Management Solutions\nLaunch timeline: The James Kenney\nCommunity Center, which serves as a care and shelter site, will undergo a seismic retrofit in 2016. The City is working\nwith community partners to identify funding and financing to upgrade the other six care and shelter facilities.\n1B.\tLaunch the Community Resilience\nCenter Program\nRecognizing the need to connect more residents with disaster preparedness, public health, climate action, and other services, the City is partnering with several community-based organizations in Berkeley to launch the Community Resilience Center (CRC) Program. Through the CRC Program, the City will provide free disaster supply \u201ccaches\u201d and disaster planning assistance to community-based organizations, such as churches and other faith-based groups, youth-empowerment organizations, cultural centers, large apartment buildings, and social services providers. These community-based organizations will be designated as Community Resilience Centers and will serve as hosts for training and conduits to information and support that is tailored to the needs\nof the people the organizations serve. The City is prioritizing partnerships with organizations that assist people who are historically underserved. Initial CRCs will include (among others) Harriet Tubman Terrace, which is an apartment complex that rents to low-income seniors and people with disabilities; the Ed Roberts Campus, which is dedicated to disability rights and universal access; and La Pena Cultural Center, which promotes social justice, arts participation, and intercultural understanding.\n1B\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Office of Emergency Services, Public Health Division, and City Manager's Office\nPartner(s): Initial CRCs include Berkeley Youth Alternatives, Ed Roberts Campus,\nHarriet Tubman Terrace, Le Pena Cultural Center, Head Start, and McGee Baptist Church\nLaunch timeline: 2016\n1C.\tFoster neighbor-to-neighbor connections to advance disaster readiness\nFollowing Berkeley's next major disaster, such as an earthquake or wildfire, government resources\nand assistance may not be available for several days. It is therefore essential that neighbors are connected to and can support each other before and after such an event. Neighbor-to-neighbor connections are especially important for socially isolated seniors and residents with disabilities.\nIn partnership with the nonprofit Berkeley Disaster Preparedness Neighborhood Network and local community leaders, the City is fostering neighborhood-level connections by identifying Neighborhood Disaster Preparedness Liaisons. The liaisons will serve as local leaders and organizers within a neighborhood and can act as conduits for nearby residents to training, information, and other support provided by the City government and other organizations.\nDuring Resilience Strategy development, some residents expressed frustration about the challenge of learning about and connecting with the disaster preparedness leaders and efforts already active in their\nneighborhood. The City is currently researching the best ways to connect residents with existing neighborhood leaders and activities. The City is researching similar efforts in other cities and will conduct a survey of Berkeley residents to help identify next steps.\n1C\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Office of Emergency Services and City Manager's Office\nLaunch timeline: 2016\n1D.\tMaximize the City's ability to secure Federal disaster recovery funding Natural disasters could devastate large areas of Berkeley, wreaking economic havoc. Following declared disasters, the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency (FEMA) Public Assistance (PA) Program provides affected jurisdictions with financial assistance to help with recovery. This assistance requires compliance with extremely complex regulations.\nLack of compliance can result in denial of funding or in the City having to return funding to the Federal government years after recovery project completion.\nThe City is undergoing a comprehensive effort to maximize Berkeley's ability to receive and retain funding from the FEMA PA Program. This effort to develop Berkeley's disaster cost recovery capability includes creation of a comprehensive Disaster Cost Recovery Strategic Plan and associated staff training for the City to ensure that its plans and policies are fully-compliant with Federal regulations in advance of our next catastrophe. In the event of a disaster, these steps are expected to form the foundation of Berkeley's recovery and to save the City hundreds of millions of dollars.\n1D\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Office of Emergency Services and City Manager's Office\nLaunch timeline: 2016\n1E.\tPrepare for wildfire in the Berkeley Hills Berkeley and the East Bay area have a history\nof destructive fire in area's wildland-urban interface. In 1923, a fire that started in Wildcat Canyon, northeast of the city, was swept by wind into residential areas of North Berkeley, where it destroyed nearly 600 structures. More recently, the 1991 Tunnel Fire in the Oakland\/Berkeley Hills destroyed entire neighborhoods in both cities, and 25 people lost their lives. The estimated damage from the 1991 fire was approximately $1.5 billion.\nSince the Tunnel Fire, the City has reduced its wildfire vulnerability through improved building codes, aggressive vegetation management, and fire training and response partnerships with other area fire departments to keep firefighters ready to respond together. The City also partners with the Berkeley Path Wanderers Association to build and maintain walking paths to assist with evacuation and firefighting efforts in the Berkeley Hills.\nDespite the City's progress, the risk of a wind-driven wildfire in the hills that could transition into a fast-moving urban firestorm in the flatlands continues. The City will build on existing readiness efforts by developing a robust wildfire evacuation traffic control plan for the Berkeley Hills. The plan will include consideration of the area's unique geography and transportation challenges and establish evacuation zones, routes, and necessary staffing and communication protocols to manage the flow of people. Once this plan is established, the City will work with the Berkeley Path Wanderers\nAssociation and neighborhood groups to ensure that area residents are aware of the best evacuation routes from their homes\u2014whether by car or on foot.\n1E\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Fire and Police Departments\nPartner(s): Berkeley Path Wanderers Association and neighboring cities\n1F.\tContinue to improve the seismic safety of Berkeley's most vulnerable apartment buildings\nIn the wake of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the City identified hundreds of wood-frame apartment buildings with weak first stories, described as a\nsoft, weak, or open-front condition. These weak first stories make the structures\u2014and the thousands of residents housed in them, many of whom are low-in-come\u2014extremely vulnerable to earthquakes. Since that time, the City has catalyzed seismic retrofits in over half of those buildings using incentive programs, City ordinances, inspections, and other tools.\nIn 2013, the City Council passed a law requiring owners of the remaining vulnerable, \u201csoft story\u201d buildings to retrofit those structures. Owners of soft story properties with five or more dwelling units must apply for a building permit by the end of 2016 and complete the work by December 31, 2018.\nThe City works to remove the financial barriers to compliance by providing a transfer tax rebate to lower the cost of seismic retrofits and access to Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing, which lets owners borrow money with no upfront cost and pay the money back at fixed rates on their property tax\nbill. Berkeley pioneered PACE financing in 2008 to promote solar energy. PACE has now been expanded nationwide and can be used to finance energy- and\nwater-efficiency projects as well as seismic retrofits.\nIn the future, the City will continue to provide a combination of technical assistance, financial\nincentives, and requirements that remove barriers to\nseismic (and energy) upgrades in vulnerable buildings.\n1F\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Building & Safety Division Launch timeline: 2016\nIt is easy to take for granted the energy we consume. Flip a light switch and the light turns on. Many of us have never experienced a prolonged power outage that significantly hampers our basic needs. But as was made clear by major disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina (2005) and Sandy (2012), which disrupted the power grid, loss of power and inadequate access to backup power create a cascading set of impacts that impede delivery of essential services for people in need, disrupt the economy, and hamper disaster recovery. In our city and region, earthquakes, wildfires, and other potential disasters present a similar risk.\nThe energy grid is also at the nexus of climate change and air pollution. Energy consumption in buildings accounts for nearly half of Berkeley's community-wide greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions are affected by both the amount and the sources of the energy we consume.\nBerkeley is uniquely capable of taking action that can both advance energy reliability and reduce emissions while also keeping more dollars in the local economy and creating local jobs in the clean energy and energy services sectors. Our community has long been at the forefront of energy innovation, including pioneering a new approach to clean energy financing and adopting one of the nation's first ordinances requiring energy audits in all building types. We benefit from having two of the nation's premiere research institutions in our backyard\u2014UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We also benefit from our active and engaged citizens, such as those who participate in the community-led Berkeley Climate Action Coalition. Together with these and other partners, the City of Berkeley (City) is poised to take action that reduces both our vulnerability to disruption of the power grid and our impact on the environment.\nResilience value\nThrough the actions identified below, the City will reduce energy costs and harmful greenhouse gas emissions while increasing green jobs, equitable access to clean energy, and the City's ability to provide critical services in the event of a disaster.\nI\n2A. Develop a clean energy micro-grid network\nA commonly accepted approach to providing emergency backup power is to install a diesel generator at vulnerable facilities. This relatively low-cost approach is reliable, but the benefit is narrow and has some\nclear downsides, including noise, air pollution, and limited capacity to provide power over the course\nof a prolonged outage without reliable access to diesel. These downsides make critical facilities vulnerable to disruption in the event of a disaster and are motivating the City's pursuit of micro-grids.\nMicro-grids enable a facility or group of facilities to operate autonomously when the main grid is disrupted; can be powered by clean energy sources, such as solar and backup batteries; can be used to reduce facilities' electricity consumption during periods of peak demand, when energy prices are at their highest; and can enhance the stability of the local grid. Unlike a diesel generator, which is only used when the grid is disrupted, a clean energy micro-grid can provide environmental\nand economic benefits every day, year-round.\nUltimately, the City and its partners seek to develop a series of micro-grids that connect multiple public and private critical facilities into several networks. The networks would have intelligent operating systems with the ability to aggregate and share clean energy from solar and energy storage batteries across multiple facilities and to \u201cisland\u201d the networked facilities from the main grid when power supply is disrupted. The City is pursuing funding to pilot this approach in Downtown\nBerkeley and, based on the lessons learned, to replicate the model in Berkeley, the region, and beyond.\n2A\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Office of Energy & Sustainable Development,\nCity Manager's Office, Department of Public Works, Planning Department\nPartner(s): Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), California Independent System\nOperator (CAISO), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), AECOM Launch timeline: 2018\n2B. Advance clean energy through \u201cCommunity Choice Aggregation\u201d\nCommunity Choice Aggregation (CCA) programs allow cities or counties to form a not-for-profit local power agency that bundles the buying power of residents and businesses to purchase electricity.\nThe local power agency can build or fund local clean energy projects, buy renewable energy on the market, offer energy-efficiency services and incentives to customers, and set electricity rates.\nThe nearby counties of Marin and Sonoma have\nlaunched CCA programs. Alameda County, which Berkeley is part of, is considering launching a CCA program in 2017, and the City is actively partici-\npating in the County's CCA Steering Committee.\nCCA has several potential benefits that may help advance Berkeley's resilience, including increased investment in local clean energy projects that\ncould create jobs, greater local control over the energy mix used to produce electricity, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\nUnder a CCA, PG&E, the investor-owned utility that serves the Bay Area, would continue to maintain the power grid, respond to outages, and send monthly bills. Customers would have an option to continue to purchase power directly from PG&E by opting out of the CCA.\n2B\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Office of Energy & Sustainable Development\nPartner(s): Alameda County,\nBerkeley Climate Action Coalition Launch timeline: 2017\n2C. Develop a Solar Action Plan to meet 50 percent of Berkeley's power demand through solar by 2030\nTo reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, stimulate investment in the local economy, and increase energy reliability, the City is launching the development of\na Solar Action Plan. The plan will build on many of Berkeley's existing efforts to remove barriers to solar adoption, including tools such as Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing, which was pioneered\nin Berkeley in 2009; expedited solar permitting; and the free solar technical assistance that is available through the local Smart Solar program. These existing efforts, in combination with State-level incentives, have catalyzed installation of approximately 1,700 solar photovoltaic systems in Berkeley between 2000 and 2015. The Solar Action Plan will prioritize opportunities to install solar for low-income households and will serve as a guide for meeting 50 percent of Berkeley's power demand through solar by 2030.\n2C\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley\u2019s\nEnergy Commission and Office of\nEnergy & Sustainable Development\nPartner(s): UC Berkeley, Community Energy Services Corporation Smart Solar Program Launch timeline: 2017\n2D. Electrify Berkeley\u2019s vehicles\nElectric Vehicles (EVs) emit 70 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a conventional vehicle with the current PG&E electricity portfolio and can reduce greenhouse gases even further as the City's energy becomes cleaner. Berkeley has been a leader in advancing EV adoption in the community by providing technical assistance and streamlined permitting for charging stations and by including EV charging readiness as a condition of use permits. The City has also installed several public EV charging stations and launched a Residential Curbside EV\nI\nI\nCharging Pilot program that offers home-charging opportunities for residents that lack off-street parking.\nThe number of EVs in Berkeley more than tripled in the last 2.5 years to more than 850. The City will continue to promote EVs as a solution for clean\ntransportation for City and private vehicles and as a way to potentially increase energy reliability in critical facilities. For example, EV batteries, in combination with solar, can store and provide backup energy storage in the event of grid disruption.\n2D\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Office of Energy & Sustainable Development, Planning Department, Department of Public Works\nPartner(s): EV Coordinating Council (supported by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)), Prospect Silicon Valley\/Bay\nArea Climate Collaborative, Governor's Office of Planning and Research Launch timeline: 2016\n2E. Encourage fuel switching to consume cleaner energy in all buildings Energy use in homes, businesses, and institutions accounts for 45 percent of Berkeley's community-wide greenhouse gas emissions; 65 percent of those emissions come from natural gas consumption, which is used mainly for space and water heating and cer-\ntain industrial processes. Achieving ambitious State and local climate action targets will ultimately require sequenced programs and policies that both make the electricity grid cleaner and transition more of our energy consumption from natural gas to electricity. This transition is critical for combatting climate change\nand will also stimulate investment in the local economy. The City will work with local and regional energy experts to develop a long-term fuel switching plan.\n2E\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley's Office of Energy & Sustainable Development, Planning Department, Building and Safety Division\nLaunch timeline: 2019\n2F. Launch a Climate Action Plan \u201cIdeas Competition\u201d\nBerkeley has made significant strides in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions (by approximately 9 percent since 2000), but the City is not on track to meet its ambitious Climate Action Plan goals of reducing emissions by 33 percent below 2000 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below 2000 levels by 2050.\nAchieving Berkeley's targets requires both advancing existing and planned initiatives and identifying new strategies at the State, regional, and local levels.\nTo identify new ideas and innovations and to foster public\/private partnerships, the City is developing an \u201cIdeas Competition.\u201d The Ideas Competition\nwill be designed to engage experts, entrepreneurs, and other interested stakeholders to help the City to develop additional, viable multi-benefit emissions-reduction strategies, including strategies to accelerate zero net energy buildings and fuel switching. The winning ideas will earn prizes, and the City will partner with the winners to identify next steps and resources for implementation.\nWith support received from the Urban Sustain-\nability Directors Network, and in partnership\nwith the Presidio Graduate School and staff from the Cities of Palo Alto, Santa Monica, and Aspen (Colorado), the City commenced development of the competition guidelines in 2016.\n2F\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Office\nof Energy & Sustainable Development,\nOffice of Economic Development\nPartner(s): Cities of Palo Alto, Santa Monica, and Aspen, Urban Sustainability Directors Network, Presidio Graduate School\nLaunch timeline: 2016\nBerkeley and the Bay Area are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. San Francisco Bay water levels are rising and are forecast to continue to do so at an accelerating rate throughout the 21st century. In combination with increasingly unpredictable and extreme rain events, sea level rise is exacerbating the limits of Berkeley's aging stormwater system. The result is more frequent and severe flooding, especially in West Berkeley.\nAlso driven by climate change, periods of drought are expected to grow longer and more severe throughout California. Drought has a range of cascading impacts on our community, including stressed urban forests and ecosystems, higher food prices, and increased risk of wildfire.\nThe consequences of flooding, drought, extreme heat, and other climate impacts are not only physical, but also social and economic. Many in the Berkeley community, based on factors such as income and the neighborhood in which they live or work, are disproportionately vulnerable.\nPreparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change require creating and activating strategies that respond to both current and future risk. Berkeley must embrace and implement innovative, multi-benefit solutions in resource management, urban planning, and infrastructure design. For example, our stormwater management infrastructure must be reimagined as a system that conveys stormwater to reduce flooding, filters it to protect our creeks and the Bay, and captures it for use or to recharge aquifers, which is especially important because we expect to experience more drought. Berkeley is already investing in green infrastructure projects that incorporate both natural and engineered elements to create benefits beyond basic flood management. The changing climate requires that we do more.\nResilience value\nThe actions identified in this section will advance Berkeley's preparedness for the impacts of climate change, help residents and businesses that are most vulnerable to flooding and drought, and protect local ecosystems.\nGreen infrastructure is creating multiple benefits in\nBerkeley. Example Berkeley projects include permeable pavement in streets (above) and rain gardens within traffic circles. Berkeley community members have provided extensive input on prioritizing green infrastructure projects throughout the city.\n3A. Integrate multi-benefit green infrastructure into street improvement projects\nGreen infrastructure (GI) is one of the best examples of resilience in practice. Unlike conventional stormwater infrastructure, GI can create multiple benefits beyond flood mitigation, including protecting ecosystems by removing pollutants, beautifying a neighborhood, and, potentially, enabling the capture and use of stormwater for other purposes. Examples of GI include rain gardens, permeable pavement, and cisterns. GI projects are being implemented more and more often across Berkeley thanks to both private and\npublic funding. The City of Berkeley (City) requires\napplicable private development to include GI in\nnew construction, which is resulting in many GI\ninstallations. Measure M bond funding, approved\nby Berkeley voters in 2012, is enabling the City to\ninstall several GI projects throughout the city.\nIn the future, the City will identify new opportunities\nto increase investment in GI. Increasing the scale\nof this work will require an integrated approach\nto infrastructure planning and design that enables\nthe City to address decades of deferred street and\nstormwater system maintenance and repair while\nalso achieving other benefits that help Berkeley adapt to changing climate conditions. To guide this work, the City will build on the Watershed Management Plan and Measure M implementation by developing a next-phase, comprehensive Stormwater Master Plan. This plan will be the result of extensive collaboration and analysis and will identify, evaluate, and prioritize stormwater system repairs, upgrades, and multi-benefit GI projects throughout the city. The plan will also identify necessary funding and financing options.\n3A\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Department of Public Works, with support from the Public Works Commission; Planning\nDepartment; Department of Parks, Recreation & Waterfront, and City Manager's Office\nPartner(s): MWH Global\n3B. Innovate to diversify Berkeley's\nwater supply\nThis first-ever Berkeley Resilience Strategy was\ndeveloped during one of the most severe, multi-\nyear droughts on record in California. Prolonged\ndrought may in fact be the new normal for our state\nA rain garden was installed within a traffic circle\nat Vine and Spruce Steets.\nand region. Transitioning to this new normal and\ncontinuing to flourish in a drier climate require that our community continue to conserve water and treat it as the valuable, scarce resource that it is and innovate and diversify Berkeley's water supply.\nThe City relies on the East Bay Municipal Utility\nDistrict (EBMUD) for its water supply. The water\nsupply begins at the Mokelumne River watershed\nin the Sierra Nevada and extends 90 miles to the\nEast Bay. The consistency of the water supply\nis highly dependent on the snow pack. During\nprolonged drought, reduced snow pack levels\ncorrelate to a diminished water supply for EBMUD\ncustomers. The City is analyzing several opportu-\nnities for water supply diversification, including:\n\u2022 In partnership with the University of California (UC), Berkeley, Climate Readiness Institute, examining the feasibility of utilizing accessible groundwater sources as backup water supply or to irrigate parks.\n\u2022 Initiating an analysis of the potential to capture stormwater in below-street cis-\nterns for use for street cleaning, irrigation, and other purposes and the conditions and technology necessary to do so.\n\u2022 Analyzing the costs and benefits of a rain -water catchment incentive program that would encourage residents and businesses to reduce potable water use for irrigation by capturing and using rainwater.\n\u2022 Working with EBMUD to access reclaimed water for street cleaning and other uses.\nIn combination, these efforts will help to\ndiversify community water supply and\nachieve greater supply independence.\n3B\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Departments of Public Works and Parks, Recreation & Waterfront and Office of\nEnergy & Sustainable Development\nPartner(s): UC Berkeley Climate\nReadiness Institute, EBMUD, AECOM Launch timeline: 2017\n3C. Create the landscape of the future\nIn response to severe drought, the City reduced\nwater consumption in municipal operations by\nover 40 percent between 2013 and 2015, saving\napproximately 35 million gallons of water and\n$200,000 in utility costs per year. The City achieved these results mainly by reducing irrigation and fixing\nleaks. Sustaining these trends while also protecting\nthe health of the City's landscapes and urban forest requires a long-term transition to new and evolving approaches to landscape and irrigation design\nthat not only contribute to Berkeley's beauty and\nlivability, but also minimize water consumption.\nThe City is committed to making this transition.\nThe City already prioritizes native, low-water\nuse, pollinator-friendly plants in parks and\nmedians and plants that produce less debris\nand therefore reduce the amount of fuel\nneeded to transport and process waste.\nTo continue to adapt to changing climate conditions, the City will work with partners in the community, including local neighborhood and business associations, to replace unnecessary water-intensive turf with drought-tolerant alternatives and upgrade\nirrigation technology and equipment. The City is\nalso working to supplement these water-saving\nefforts by diversifying its non-potable water supply.\n3C\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley Departments of Parks, Recreation & Waterfront and Public Works\nPartner(s): Downtown Berkeley Association and EBMUD\nLaunch timeline: 2016\n3D. Integrate consideration of climate impacts into capital and land use planning\nCapital and land use planning efforts can no\nlonger be based on the climate of the past.\nInstead, urban design and development must\nbe informed by the latest climate science to\ndetermine how to best protect and modify existing\npublic and private infrastructure and assets and\nhow to design new infrastructure and assets.\nOur neighbor, the City and County of San Francisco,\nis providing important leadership and tools for\nincorporating sea level rise into capital planning. In\ncollaboration with San Francisco and other academic, government, non-governmental organization (NGO), and private-sector partners in the region, Berkeley\nwill work to incorporate consideration of sea level rise and other climate impacts into public infrastructure and asset design and land use planning and site\ndevelopment standards for private assets. Ultimately, based on ongoing review of climate science and associated vulnerability assessments, the City will develop guidance for City departments and private developers on how to understand and incorporate the potential range of climate impacts that could occur within the project's planning horizon and beyond.\n3D\nAction Lead(s): City of Berkeley Planning Department, Office of Energy & Sustainable Development, and City Manager's Office\nPartner(s): City and County of San Francisco Launch timeline: 2018\nRacial equity will be achieved when race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes. The City of Berkeley government (City) and all local govern ments have a responsibility to identify and eliminate institutional barriers to racial equity. Although the City alone cannot eliminate racial inequity, proactive City leadership has the potential to support significant change.\nWith the support, encouragement, and advocacy of many organizations in our community, the City is committed to ensuring that racial equity is reflected throughout City policies and practices and is reinforced at all levels of the City organization. We do not start from scratch. The City's Human Resources department already implements staff trainings focused on understanding and advancing the value of diversity and on integrating racial equity into hiring and promotional practices. The Berkeley Police Department, one of the most representatively diverse police departments in the United States, trains its officers to eliminate implicit bias. The Health, Housing, and Community Services Department has identified and publicized race-based health inequities for Berkeley residents and is working toward equal health opportunities for all. The goal of eradicating racial inequities informs much of the City's outreach and services related to improving disaster preparedness and educational achievement.\nThe City and its partners are making progress, but much work\nremains to be done. The actions identified below reflect the\nCity's commitment to creating institutional change and advancing a collective racial equity agenda on a community scale.\nResilience value\nBy helping to advance racial equity, the actions described below help to enable the participation and contribution of all community members in all\naspects of Berkeley society The participation of all community members\u2014 and contributions from them\u2014is fundamental to Berkeley's resilience.\n4A. Develop a City of Berkeley Racial Equity Action Plan\nOver the past decade, a solid field of practice has emerged that advances racial equity and transforms government. The field of practice is based on the\nexperience of cities and counties across the U.S. that have developed and implemented racial equity tools, policies, and partnerships. A national network of\nlocal and regional governments working to achieve racial equity, called the Government Alliance on Race and Equity (GARE), has documented and helped to advance the field of practice. The City and several\nother Bay Area cities and counties, including Oakland and San Francisco, are partnering with GARE to develop city-specific Racial Equity Action Plans.\nIn collaboration with key stakeholders, including the City Personnel Board, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and employee labor unions, the City will develop, implement, and sustain its Racial Equity Action Plan. Components of the plan designed to operationalize equity within the City government and to influence structural change community-wide include:\n\u2022 Advancing workforce diversity by continuing to provide and optimize training for staff at all levels of City government that focuses on equitable hiring and promotion prac-\ntices, valuing racial diversity, and offering career development for entry-level staff\n\u2022 Improving City outreach and community engagement processes to enable all residents to have an opportunity to partici-\npate in decision-making and to expand the number of residents that do participate\n\u2022 Consistently integrating a racial equity lens into the City's budget and procurement processes to ensure that these processes benefit all demographic groups in the community\n\u2022 Identifying specific results in City work plans that advance racial equity in City operations and services\n\u2022 Evaluating and communicating data on racial equity that are used to track progress and inform strategy shifts\nif progress is not being made\n\u2022 Sharing challenges, lessons learned, and best practices with other institutions and organizations in Berkeley\n4A\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley City Manager's Office and all City departments\nPartner(s): City of Berkeley Personnel Board, NAACP, Government Alliance on Race & Equity, employee labor unions\nLaunch timeline: 2016\n4B. Create a multi-departmental City \u201cAdvancing Racial Equity Team\u201d\nWith support and representation from City leadership, the City will identify a multi-departmental team of staff to oversee and implement the Berkeley Racial Equity Action Plan. This team, the Advancing Racial Equity Team, will reflect the diversity of the community that the City serves and will guide the ongoing work of operationalizing racial equity at all levels of the City government.\n4B\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley City Manager's Office\nPartner(s)::City of Berkeley Personnel Board, NAACP, Government Alliance on Race & Equity, employee labor unions\nLaunch timeline: 2016\n4C. Continue to partner with organizations and institutions in the community to advance community-wide racial equity\nIn 2008, a multi-agency partnership was formed in Berkeley with the aim of ending the racial predict-\nability of academic achievement that exists in the Berkeley Public Schools. Called the 2020 Vision, the partnership is working to achieve academic success and well-being for all children and youth growing up in Berkeley by closing the achievement gap in Berkeley's public schools by the year 2020. The partnership includes the City, the Berkeley Unified School District, the Berkeley Alliance, UC Berkeley, Berkeley City College, the YMCA, and many other members of the Berkeley community. The 2020 Vision is a clear acknowledgment by leading Berkeley organizations that racial inequity persists in our community, and that it is unacceptable.\nAs it works to advance racial equity within its own organization, the City will build on existing efforts such as the 2020 Vision to create new structures and partnerships to help promote a collective racial equity agenda in the community. Priorities for the City and its partners moving forward include expanding services for families with children 0 to 3 years old to better prepare children for kindergarten and developing improved college and career readiness strategies for high-school-aged youth.\n4C\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley City Manager\u2019s Office\nPartner(s): Berkeley Unified School District, UC Berkeley, Berkeley City College, Berkeley Alliance, YMCA, and many others\nLaunch timeline: 2016\nThe goals and actions identified in the Resilience Strategy meet some of Berkeley's most pressing challenges head-on, including preparing for natu ral disasters, upgrading aging infrastructure, adapting to climate change, and advancing racial equity. Although the City of Berkeley government (City) is certainly not the only entity in the community that has a role in addressing these big challenges, it must provide vision\nand effective leadership. The City must continue to break down traditional governmental \u201csilos\u201d and integrate the expertise and knowledge within City departments and divisions to implement solutions that engage and create multiple benefits for many people. The actions identified below are the practical next steps that the City will take to excel at providing the leadership necessary to take on some of the community's most pressing challenges.\nResilience value\nThrough the actions identified here, the City will improve access to services for all residents; further integrate sustainability and equity throughout City operations; improve City government efficiency through increased multi-disciplinary, multi-departmental collaboration; and deepen community engagement in local decision-making.\nIn 2015, the City of Berkeley held a\nfriendly competition between departments to\ndevelop a \u201cOne City Team\u201d logo, which represents the commitment of City employees\nto work together as a team to provide\nexcellent service to the community. The\nwinning logo, shown here, was submitted by the Fire Department.\n5A. Engage the community in the development of a Berkeley Strategic Plan\nThe City is launching a strategic planning process to better articulate the long-term goals that the City will work to achieve in service to the community and the short-term priority projects designed to achieve those goals. The Berkeley Strategic Plan will serve as a tool against which future potential projects\nand policies can be evaluated and prioritized. This plan will be integrated with the City's two-year budget cycle, and its ongoing implementation will be guided by a transparent, easy-to-access performance-reporting dashboard on the City's website.\nEvery community member and City staff person will have an opportunity to participate in the strategic planning process through web-based surveys, public workshops, and other events. The planning process and the plan itself will be designed to foster integrated, multi-disciplinary, and multi-benefit solutions to the challenges our community faces. By identifying actions that address some of our community's\nmost pressing challenges, the Berkeley Resilience Strategy dovetails with the strategic planning process. The Berkeley Strategic Plan will build on the Resilience Strategy by addressing additional challenges, such as homelessness, affordable housing, and public safety and by serving as the City's ongoing performance management guide.\n5A\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley\nCity Manager's Office\nPartner(s): City commissions, neighborhood and business associations, and many others Launch timeline: 2016\n5B. Implement opportunities for multidepartmental input on major City plans and projects\nThe City is evaluating a range of mechanisms designed to increase \u201ccross-silo\u201d coordination within the City government. The City already places high value on multi-departmental coordination. Development of the Berkeley Resilience Strategy, with its focus on multi-disciplinary, multi-benefit solutions to pressing challenges, is helping to advance and institutionalize this approach.\nThe mechanisms being evaluated will serve as triggers for ensuring that major plans and projects, such as large capital improvement projects, benefit from the expertise and guidance of staff in all City departments, including the staff who lead the City's efforts to\nadvance sustainability, public health, racial equity, and fiscal goals. A trigger for multi-departmental review will help to further integrate consideration of a diverse range of community priorities into any given project or plan. An example of an existing mechanism that the City currently uses and could replicate for other purposes is the interdepartmental roundtable meet-\nVolunteers spend day of service at a local park for\nBerkeley Project day. Photo credit: The Berkeley Project\nings that the City's Land Use Planning staff coordinate for any large private development project. Early in the design phase of a building, such as a new mixed-use, transit-oriented development in Downtown Berkeley, a team of urban planning, economic development,\npublic works, parks, public safety, and sustainability staff, among others, meets with the private development team to review the preliminary design in the\ncontext of existing State and local requirements and, as appropriate, to provide guidance on designing a project that goes beyond what is required. The City is evaluating the next steps for institutionalizing a similar multi-departmental review of other major\nplans and projects, among other mechanisms.\n5B\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley City Manager\u2019s Office Launch timeline: 2016\n5C. Improve major City information technology systems\nTo improve access to services and information for community members and create more efficient financial and information management processes for City staff, the City is replacing its current website infrastructure and core data management software. This investment in improving major City government information technology systems is based on input from community members and City staff. The current systems do not efficiently provide community members with easy access to information and services online (for example, the ability to pay fees via the City website) or adequately foster uniform data management across City departments. Replacement of the City's web infrastructure and core data management software will also help the City to better provide timely information in the event of a disaster and better track and manage disaster recovery operations. Effective tracking and documentation of disaster recovery activities and expenditures are critical for enabling recovery of those costs from the Federal government in the event of a federally declared disaster.\nThe City of Berkeley (City) is one of 101 cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. The region spans approximately 6,900 square miles of land and is home to over 7.5 million people.\nEach of the Bay Area cities has qualities that make it unique, including its culture, food, topography, and politics. But Bay Area cities also share many qualities in common, not least of which are the physical, social, and economic challenges that Berkeley's Resilience Strategy is designed to address. Natural disasters, climate change impacts, aging public infrastructure, racial inequity\u2014these challenges are not confined within the boundaries of any one city.\nAt times it may be tempting or feel easier for cities to take on these challenges in isolation. But identifying solutions that match the scale of the challenges we face requires regional coordination. Regional coordination has the potential to increase the reach of good ideas and increase the influence of cities' concerns and needs. Because cities are interdependent and frequently share resources, each city stands to benefit when the region as a whole becomes more resilient.\n100 Resilient Cities (100RC)\u2014Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, knew well the value of regional approaches to problem solving when it selected Berkeley, San Francisco, and Oakland as three of the first 32 cities to participate in 100RC. The 100RC program also provided support to the region's Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) to help spread lessons from the three cities' resilience planning efforts and to contribute to a collective resilience agenda at a regional scale.\nThe actions\ndiscussed\nbelow are\ndesigned to\nidentify spe-\ncific, tangible\nprojects to\nwhich Berke-\nley\u2014along\nwith many\nother cities\u2014is\ncontributing to\nadvance a regional\nresilience agenda.\nResilience value\nThe actions identified\nhere promote long-term\nintegrated planning to\nbetter prepare the region\nfor climate change impacts,\nnatural disasters, and other\nchallenges; empower cities and the\ncommunities they serve to collectively\nadvocate for the resources needed to\neffectively build the region's resilience; and foster partnerships between public agencies, private-sector entities, lifeline agencies, and community-based organizations to develop and implement innovative solutions.\n6A. Develop and launch a regional\nResilience by Design Challenge\nThe City is contributing to the development and\nlaunch of a regional urban planning and design\ncompetition. The Resilience by Design Challenge\n(the Challenge) will unite multi-disciplinary teams of architecture, landscape, urban design, ecology, and finance experts with community members and local and regional government leaders to identify innovative, actionable urban design solutions that help prepare the region for the impacts of climate change. The Challenge is an opportunity to elevate\nthe public dialogue regarding our rapidly\nchanging climate and to develop multi-benefit solutions that improve our communities.\nMulti-disciplinary design teams from around\nthe world will be invited to apply to partici-\npate. Selected teams will conduct intensive\nresearch of existing conditions, challenges,\nand opportunities and will then work with local government and community stakeholders to develop design solutions that will help communities adapt to and prepare for the impacts of climate change, such as flooding and drought. A jury will review the teams' final designs and select winners. Local government partners will work with selected teams to develop project implementation plans and funding sources.\nThe outcome of the Challenge will be a set\nof robust design solutions that make our\ncommunities and our region more resilient.\n6A\nAction lead(s): Managing partners include the Bay Conservation and Development Commission; ABAG; Coastal Conservancy; Bay\nArea Regional Collaborative; San Francisco\nBay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR); San Francisco Estuary\nInstitute; City of San Francisco Planning Department; and Chief Resilience Officers of Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco\nPartner(s): Bay Area local governments and communities Launch timeline: 2016\n6B. Launch a regional Sustainable Water Summit\nAs a result of climate change, periods of drought\nare expected to become longer and more severe in\nCalifornia. This challenge is exacerbated by a growing population\u2014the Bay Area is expected to grow by approximately 2 million residents over the next 25 years.\nBerkeley and other Bay Area communities are taking steps to improve their water conservation efforts and diversify their water supply. To help accelerate, align, and increase the scale of existing efforts, the City\nwill contribute to convening a regional Sustainable\nWater Summit, which will focus on identifying\nstrategies for the long-term, sustainable management of water resources. With coordinating assistance from ABAG, the summit will involve participation by public, private, non-profit, and academic entities.\n6B\nAction lead(s): ABAG\nPartner(s): The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), City of Berkeley and other Bay Area local governments,\nBay Area academic institutions, water utilities, community-based organizations, foundations and other funding agencies Launch timeline: 2016\n6C. Establish a Regional Lifelines Council Lifelines are the energy, water, transportation, and communications systems that are part of the fabric of our communities. These systems are essential for daily life and disaster response and recovery, but they are also vulnerable to disruption from earthquake, wildfire, and other shocks. The agencies that own and operate lifeline services in the Bay Area, such as water and energy utilities, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART), and others, are making significant strides in designing, constructing, and upgrading critical facilities to reduce risk.\nTo accelerate and align these efforts, the City is\ncontributing to the efforts of ABAG to design and\nlaunch a Regional Lifelines Council (Council). The\nCouncil will be made up of representatives from\nlifeline agencies, local governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Council will enable improved communication and collaboration, shared disaster response and recovery planning. The Council will also develop and implement clearly defined,\ncoordinated processes for restoring lifeline\nsystems as quickly as possible after a disaster.\n6C\nAction lead(s): ABAG and the U.S.\nDepartment of Homeland Security Office of Infrastructure Protection\nPartner(s): City of Berkeley and other Bay Area local governments; Bay Area lifeline agencies; other regional, state, and federal agencies\nfoundations and other funding agencies Launch timeline: 2017\n6D. Catalyze investment in the region's public infrastructure The City, like many cities, is faced with the challenge of how to identify the tens of millions of dollars necessary to upgrade and maintain aging, degrading public infrastructure. Streets, sidewalks, stormwater systems, parks, and community-serving facilities are in need of repair and renovation to continue to effectively serve their functions.\nThis challenge is exacerbated by the impacts of climate change, such as flooding due to sea level rise, and natural disasters, such as earthquakes.\nThe City will work with ABAG, the Cities of\nOakland and San Francisco, and other Bay Area\nlocal governments and organizations to catalyze\ndevelopment of a regional infrastructure finance\nagenda that can attract additional, much-needed\npublic and private investment. Collectively, Bay\nArea cities can articulate the scale of the need\nfor additional infrastructure investment\u2014and the\nrisk of not making adequate investment\u2014more\neffectively than one city can on its own.\n6D\nAction lead(s): City of Berkeley and ABAG Partner(s): Bay Area local governments Launch timeline: 2017\n6E. Form regional alliances for policy\nadvocacy\nA single jurisdiction cannot on its own effectively\nadapt to sea level rise, improve the regional\ntransportation network, respond to drought,\nprepare for and recover from a disaster, take on\nthe affordable housing challenge, and develop the region's economy of the future. Given the regional nature of many of the Bay Area's most-pressing\nchallenges and most-effective solutions, the City\nis committed to continuing to participate in and\nelevate action-oriented regional collaboration.\nTangible opportunities to advance regional coor-\ndination include partnering with the other 100RC\nnetwork cities in the region and state\u2014the Cities of Oakland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles\u2014to share lessons learned in resilience planning with other\nBay Area and California cities and continuing to\nparticipate in ABAG's East Bay Corridor Initiative,\nwhich is a platform for developing common policies\nand practices among East Bay cities. Given the\nrisk of earthquake in the East Bay, to date the East\nBay Corridor Initiative has placed particular and\nhelpful emphasis on development of consistent\nordinances for encouraging or requiring upgrades\nto the region's most vulnerable building stock.\nEffective policies developed at the regional level can affect action throughout the state and beyond.\n6E\nAction Lead(s): The Cities of Berkeley,\nOakland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles;

Over the last century, Boulder has consistently served as a destination\nfor individuals defined by their creative and innovative spirit, originating some\nof the most progressive policies in the United States in a variety of areas. Its long history of preserving open space and its bold climate action plans and programs are just a few examples. This work complements your history in sustainability\nand establishes Boulder at the vanguard of the urban resilience revolution that\nwill define our time.\nThis strategy takes a comprehensive and honest view of Boulder's resilience\nchallenges and opportunities. It outlines a path forward for the city to confront not just its most obvious shocks, like flash flooding or wildfires, but also the chronic stresses, such as the need for affordable housing, integrated regional planning, and strong, cohesive communities, which exacerbate those shocks and impact the city over the long term.\nNone of this could have been accomplished without the stalwart support and\nvision of the Mayor, Suzanne Jones, City Manager, Jane Brautigam and the\nBoulder City Council. We also extend our thanks to Boulder's exceptional Chief\nResilience Officer, Greg Guibert. Greg led a tremendous effort over the course of the past year of robust research, extensive community outreach, and thoughtful planning in order to make this strategy come to fruition.\nWhat makes Boulder's strategy a leading example for our international network of member cities is the way in which it integrates world-class solutions from our platform of partners, while also highlighting the various city-to-city\nconnections Boulder has facilitated through the 100RC network. Boulder has\nhosted resilience delegations from Da Nang, Vietnam around climate change\nmitigation efforts, and will do so again, with another 100 Resilient Cities\npartner, Wellington, New Zealand around a community based resilience\noutreach program, in the coming months.\nGoing forward, we know that this bold vision will strengthen your work to make Boulder a more resilient city for the entire community. As you begin to implement the various initiatives outlined in this strategy, I am confident that Boulder will continue to honor its history as an urban innovator, and begin to export the lessons we learn together to cities across the 100RC network and beyond. My congratulations to you all, on behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team. We look forward to partnering with Boulder on its resilience journey for many years to come.\nDear neighbors,\nWe are delighted to present Boulder's Resilience Strategy, a document that reflects approaches our community will be taking as we work to\nstrengthen our preparedness for - and ability to respond to - future challenges. These approaches build on what we already know works in our highly engaged community, as well as best practices we have learned about as one of the inaugural cities participating in the 100 Resilient Cities program. We are so appreciative of the opportunity to work with 100RC and the cohort of other cities in the program, and want to acknowledge their leadership in this crucial endeavor.\nYou will notice that each of the strategic focus areas in our Resilience Strategy is defined by verbs. This is by design. We know that the best way to make Boulder more resilient in the face of stress is to act - to act now, to act strategically and with appropriate coordination, and to act together. And as you can see, there is an exciting group of initiatives underway under each of these focus areas.\nIn exploring what it means to be a \u201cresilient\u201d community, this resultant strategy recognizes the importance of broadening our understanding of potential future stresses. We know from recent experiences that wildfires and floods are very real dangers in Boulder. But this plan covers so much more. How can Boulder leverage the emerging risk of the Emerald Ash Borer beetle, for example, to make our forestry systems and practices stronger? How can we strengthen the social fabric of our neighborhoods and provide more support to particularly vulnerable populations so they can withstand potential economic downturns more effectively? How can the city work with the business community to ensure that they have plans in place to recover quickly after disruptions?\nAs you read through this strategy document, we hope you will feel the same pride we do for our community. Many of you have played a role in the creation of this framework. You've participated in forums and learning opportunities. You've engaged in dialogue with our Chief Resilience Officer Greg Guibert. And you've provided input that has helped us understand our community's priorities. We are so grateful for this kind of support and engagement. Our people and our sense of community continue to be among our greatest assets as we work toward the shared goal of strengthening Boulder and implementing the many terrific programs outlined in this plan. Let's work together to make Boulder the very best - and strongest - it can be!\nSincerely,\nSuzanne Jones Mayor\nJane Brautigam City Manager\nBOULDER has a long history of planning today for the challenges of tomorrow, creating innovative solutions, and undertaking successful resilience-building\nactivities and projects. From its 40+ year legacy of open space preservation, to pioneering commitments to climate action goals, the community has supported some\nof the most progressive resilience activities in the country for decades, even before we saw them as building Boulder's resilience.\nIn order to mobilize the resources and community support necessary to significantly increase social, economic and ecological resilience, we must have a compelling vision of the future that allows us to adapt and thrive in the face of disruption. Tapping into the community's forward-thinking civic and planning culture, the goal is to weave resilience into the day-to-day life and functions of community and government. This strategy knits those activities together and presents new actions to address gaps and weaknesses discovered through a community-wide assessment to create an integrated, strategic, and intentional approach to building resilience. The actions included here are immediately implementable activities that take advantage of partnerships and resources offered by the 100 Resilient Cities network. They build off of a long and fruitful legacy in Boulder's community and intend to bring new resources and perspectives to existing ones.\nAn Unpredictable Future\nLike many cities and communities across the country and around the world, Boulder is adjusting to a \u201cnew normal,\u201d where the effects of climate change are becoming\nincreasingly apparent. And like residents of other cities that have recently experienced a severe natural disaster, many of us understandably perceive resilience as preparing for the kinds of events that are magnified by climate change. But shocks are not limited to natural hazards or the effects of climate change. A hyper-connected economy and the ability for pests and diseases to circle the globe with unprecedented speed, for example, mean the community is confronting a host of challenges that can strike at little notice and have severe, unknowable repercussions.\nBoulder's complex topography and natural climate variability make it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to predict when and how often extreme events may occur.\nFlash flooding, for example, does not follow the boundaries of established flood maps, a lesson learned through the adversity of the 2013 floods. Flash floods may inundate neighborhoods and roads with little advance notice, impacting locations that may not have experienced flooding in the past.\nAt the same time, increasing global temperatures exacerbate many of these hazards. The 2011 National Academies of Science assessment indicates that a one-degree\nCelsius rise in temperature would increase fire incidence probabilities by over 600 percent. Rising temperatures also increase the length of drought cycles, which intensify\nflood, fire risks and create additional risks for Boulder's water supply. These dry conditions have in turn exacerbated insect, exotic weed, and disease threats in the flora and\nfauna communities. These complex climate and ecological connections show the tight linkages between Boulder's risks and complicate solutions to any single problem,\nnecessitating a holistic approach.\nInterlinked Hazards\nBoulder's natural hazards are tightly linked, necessitating a comprehensive and integrated\napproach to risk mitigation. Droughts stress the city's ecosystems, helping accelerate the damage\nof pests to forests, thereby increasing the fuel for wildfires, and consequently denuding slopes and increasing flash flooding risk. But this cycle itself is not linear; each event builds on another and sets the stage for even more complex interactions. Therefore, to address these interlinked hazards,\nactivities and programs must be well coordinated, using a systemic approach to reduce multiple\nrisks at the same time and prepare communities to handle disruptions of any kind.\nUNDERLYING STRESSES\nResilience is not only about disaster preparedness and extreme events. It is about addressing the\nchronic stresses on a fundamental level that weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis. By focusing on both shocks and stresses together, Boulder becomes more able to respond to challenging events and is more likely to thrive as a happy, healthy and inclusive community.\n\u201cLower-income people are among the least able to recover, yet they\nare often central to the economy and culture of a community.\u201d\n- ISET INTERNATIONAL\nShocks Expose Stresses\nBoulder's social and economic stresses are sometimes harder to see, but can be exposed and exacerbated during a crisis or disaster. The city's vibrant economy and high\nquality of life often mask latent stresses that strain the community and make it less resilient overall. Natural disasters like floods and fires disproportionately impact\nlow-income residents who already struggle to thrive in a city that is becoming more unaffordable. A Boulderite living on a fixed income, for example, whose home is\ndamaged in a disaster has limited options to find affordably-priced alternatives because the city has a constrained supply of housing.\nStresses can also present a threat to our economic future. Successful, thriving cities need young people to fuel their economic pipeline. However, in Boulder, individuals\nbetween the ages of 25 to 44 is a cohort that has declined by 15 percent since 2000. Similarly, increasing real estate prices have also affected the commercial sector. High office rents and limited commercial space hamper the opportunity of growth-stage firms seeking to expand from start-up status, and many of these companies choose to expand in places like Denver and Longmont where there may be more available space.\nBoulder's Core Resilience Challenges:\nNatural events such as flooding and wildfires will become more frequent and severe as a result of climate change.\nEcological and social stresses are tied to hazards and will negatively impact and exacerbate each other.\nRising housing and commercial real estate costs may limit the diversity of residents and businesses and threaten long-term economic vitality, community character and social cohesion.\nBoulder's residents, businesses and government need to work together to be vigilant and prepared for future disruption.\nResilient Communities and Government\nAt a community level, preparing for an uncertain future means understanding our risks and being vigilant for the unexpected, whether it is a flash flood or global recession. It means that individuals, families and neighborhoods strengthen ties to support each other during times of need. Residents will need to reach out to their neighbors, particularly the most vulnerable and isolated individuals, to support each other when disaster strikes and critical systems fail. Business owners will need to create business\ncontinuity plans and understand the available public and private resources to prepare for the\neconomic risks they face.\nAt the same time, local government must plan for and respond to shocks that affect the city\nand stresses by working collaboratively across departments and jurisdictional boundaries, as\nwell as with private and institutional stakeholders. This collaborative approach will facilitate\nmore robust information sharing and analysis, development of cross-cutting solutions and\nstrategic private-public partnerships.\nLeveraging Boulder's History of Planning Innovation\nBoulder's pioneering spirit and commitment to advancing critical initiatives such as open\nspace preservation, climate mitigation and inclusive affordable housing happened decades\nbefore the rest of the country adopted similar efforts. Through this strategy, and as reflected by the process leading up to the preparation of this document, the Boulder community will prepare and adapt to existing and future challenges by infusing resilience into the day-to-day operations and activities of residents, businesses and government.\nHOUSING AFFORDABILITY INITIATIVES\nWe recognize that housing affordability is a key issue for the community. It ensures that Boulder remains a place for residents of different\nbackgrounds, incomes and household sizes.\n\u2022 Boulder's mandatory inclusionary housing ordinance requires 20 percent of housing in new developments to be priced affordably for low-income households.\n\u2022 As of August 2015, there are 3,586 units in Boulder's affordable housing program. This represents 8 percent of the total units in the city, which puts Boulder 2 percent away from the city's goal of making 10 percent of all\nhousing units affordable.\nFISCAL LEADERSHIP\nLeadership in fiscal resilience is making\nBoulder better equipped to respond to and recover from economic shocks, whether this is withstanding a global recession or\nresponding to a major event.\n\u2022 For many Front Range cities, nearly 75 percent of revenues come from sales taxes; in Boulder, less than 45 percent of sales taxes comprise the city's general fund, thereby helping to insulate the city's finances from periodic declines in tourism or cyclical economic shifts..\n\u2022 One of the city's primary financial policies is that one-time revenues shall only be used to cover one-time expenses and that ongoing costs should not be greater than ongoing revenues.\nOPEN SPACE CONSERVATION\nNearly 50 years ago, Boulder voters enacted\nan open space initiative where residents taxed themselves to purchase and preserve und eveloped land surrounding the city, an\nunprecedented feat at the time and even\ntoday still rarely emulated.\n\u2022 The roots of our community's robust open space system date back to 1875 to 1929 when the city acquired over 5,000 acres, including\nChautauqua, Buckingham Park (in Left Hand Canyon) and much of the mountain backdrop.\n\u2022 There are more than 45,000 acres of land with 151 miles of trails in the city's open space system, with an additional 102,000 acres in the County's system. New land is acquired through sales tax revenues, bond issues, private donations and development dedication. Nearly 5.3 million visitors enjoy the city's open space each year.\nBoulder has a long history of planning today for the challenges of tomorrow, creating innovative solutions and undertaking many successful resilience-building activities and projects.\nLocated at the base of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Boulder is a small city with a high quality of life, a diverse and vibrant economic base and tremendous open space resources.The community enjoys the natural and recreational amenities resulting from decades of progressive land use planning which preserves a vast rural and undeveloped landscape that encircles the city. Boulder is truly a city whose identity and future is inextricably linked with the natural environment, and environmental sustainability has been a long-standing and primary guiding principle in planning and policies. A strong commitment to sustainability is regularly reinforced through voter-initiated ballot measures to increase taxation for additional open space preservation or carbon reduction measures.\nBOULDER'S natural terrain and location at the mouth of numerous canyons creates a constant flood risk for the city. Fifteen major creeks pass through town,\nincluding Boulder Creek, which flows right through downtown. The Front Range is also susceptible to wildfires and drought, which create dry, less vegetated conditions and contribute to increased flood risk. In addition, Boulder's propensity for sudden bursts of isolated and severe storms contributes to flash flooding risk. Flooding and wildfires demonstrate the connections between Boulder's natural environment, climate change-related conditions and the interconnections between major hazards.\nBOULDER'S WATER RESOURCES\nLike most western communities, Boulder depends on stored water most of the year. High streamflows from melting snowpack occur for only a few spring and summer\nmonths. Natural streamflows in late summer and the winter are not sufficient to meet customer demands and must be supplemented with previously stored water supplies. The amount of water available also changes from year to year depending on how much snow falls in the mountains. Therefore, Boulder must store water in reservoirs during wetter years to carry over for use in dry years.\nThe city stores water in seven reservoirs and several natural lakes in the headwaters of the North Boulder Creek basin within the Silver Lake Watershed. In addition, the city\nstores water in the Barker Reservoir facilities on Middle Boulder Creek and the Boulder Reservoir northeast of Boulder. The latter is supplied through Western Slope water\ndiversions that come from miles away.\nInvesting in both source water protection and enhancing water infrastructure continue to be of chief importance to the city. This has included investments that secure\nadditional capacity and redundancy at the city's water treatement facilities which help reduce risk from drought and other concerns. It also includes a long history of\ninvesting in the city's stormwater and wastewater systems which help mitigate flooding and sewer back-ups.\nINVASIVE SPECIES ARE A MAJOR CONCERN FOR BOULDER\nBoulder's urban forest provides nearly $5.2 million in annual environmental, economic and social services benefits to the community. These services include air quality\nimprovements, energy savings, stormwater runoff reduction, atmospheric CO2 reduction and aesthetic contributions to the social and economic health of the community. One of the largest threats faced by urban forests across the U.S. is from invasive insects and disease pests such as the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). EAB will cause mortality of all untreated ash trees in Boulder and destroy a significant portion of urban tree canopy.\nFrom Fire to Drought to Flood\nChanging weather in Colorado is nothing new, but the arc of shocks\nfrom 2012 to 2013 offers a glimpse of the types of extreme events and\nswings that will only be exacerbated by the impacts of a warming\nclimate. A dry summer with little rainfall set up conditions for Boulder's 2012 Flagstaff Fire. Drought concerns loomed larger in Boulder and across the state moving into 2013, only to have the year end with\nflooding and record rainfall.\nThe Greenways Program\nThe Greenways Program divides each of the city's 15 tributaries into\nreaches to facilitate a manageable implementation approach for\nimprovements. The greenways system is maintained by the city and\nfunded by the city's Transportation Fund, Stormwater and Flood Control Utility Fund and the state's Lottery Fund. Each of these funding sources provides $150,000 annually to 1) protect and restore riparian, floodplain and wetland habitat; 2) enhance water quality; 3) mitigate storm\ndrainage and floods; 4) provide alternative modes of transportation\nroutes or trails for pedestrians and bicyclists; 5) provide recreation\nopportunities and 6) protect cultural resources\nCOMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS)\nThe federal Community Rating System provides flood insurance discounts to communities that exceed the minimum requirements to prevent and reduce flood damage to insurable property. The city's efforts have earned discounted flood insurance rates for Boulder property owners.\nCIVIC CENTER FLOOD MEMORIAL\nGilbert F. White arguably did more to advance flood policy than anyone. While his efforts had broad impacts advancing natural hazard research, White was a tour de force in Boulder. The Gilbert F. White Memorial dedication monument marks the level of the 50-year, 100-year, 500-year and the Big Thompson floods (one of the biggest in Colorado).\nRegional Resilience\nBoulder is part of a larger community and region, and, just as the shocks and stresses we face do not simply start at the borders, neither do the actions and partnerships necessary to address them. Even as recent disasters have motivated Boulder's own resilience building efforts, they have also spurred action at the county, state and national levels. Boulder has developed a strong network of partnerships that have helped inform activities and strategies, and it regularly participates in the collaborative development of this emerging field.\nBoCo Strong\nBoCo Strong is a countywide resilience hub that creates and supports collaborative relationships between individuals,\ncommunities, nonprofits, governments and businesses. BoCo Strong increases the web of connections among individuals, organizations and governments across Boulder County to foster inclusivity, increase disaster resilience and build vibrant and prosperous communities. Its vision is that all Boulder communities will have access to the resources and connections needed to allow all residents to adapt and thrive in the face of community stressors. From the outset, Boulder has\nrecognized that the challenges we face do not start or stop at the city's edge. Building a sustaining effort requires close\ncollaboration, learning from a broad base of experience and building enduring partnerships.\nColorado Resilience Framework\nGovernor John Hickenlooper adopted the Colorado Resiliency Framework in May of 2015, a first-of-its-kind statewide\nframework in the nation. The framework was developed under the leadership of the Colorado Resiliency and Recovery\nOffice (CRRO) through a collaborative and inclusive process that engaged local, state, federal, non-profit and private sector partners, as well as individual Coloradans. The framework provides guiding principles for Colorado communities and concrete actions that the state commits to implement. One of the first priority strategies implemented under the\nframework was a pilot regional resiliency planning process to build and strengthen collaborative relationships locally,\nestablish a unified regional vision for resilience, and put in place a coordinating framework for long-term regional resilience action. Starting in the summer of 2015, the CRRO partnered with some of the most heavily disaster-impacted communities to conduct the pilot process which utilized the state framework's guiding principles to help facilitate a vision and identify strategies unique to each participating region. The Boulder County region was one of three communities to participate.\nGROWING UP BOULDER\nIn collaboration with Resilient Boulder, Growing Up Boulder (GUB) worked with approximately 120 children and youth to develop their perceptions of resilience within the city. Overall, access to nature and family, friends and supportive networks (from school and community) help support resilience, as do activities that help young people develop skills and confidence (including music, arts and skateboarding). Aspects of the community that do not support resilience include social, environmental and economic concerns (including the need for greater care of homeless residents,\nfracking and the cost of living). Children spoke about bullying and youth spoke about cultural exclusion as aspects of\ntheir community that need to be addressed in the city. High school students also participated in a poetry project in\nwhich they described a personal moment of resilience. Many of these stories included surviving the flood, family losses and coping with poor family health, and the challenges of immigration\/immigration status. Access to nature in relatively close walking space could help some of the children and youth we worked with access greater opportunities for restoration and resilience.\nResilience and Sustainability\nResilience and sustainability are sometimes confused with one another. Resilience is a new way of thinking about the community in a holistic way that adds to and deepens the way we already plan for a sustainable future. Resilience and sustainability represent complementary values and ways of managing urban systems. Where sustainability\nis about actively and thoughtfully managing resources to achieve environmental, social and economic goals that preserve or enhance Boulder's quality of life, resilience is about anticipating the inevitable events that cause disruption and then developing the strategies to reduce their impacts to the greatest extent\npossible. While resilience itself is not new, 100 Resilient Cities is the first organization to use resilience as a systematic framework, on a global scale, for actively managing and\nprioritizing city operations and activities.\ni- SUSTAINABILITY:\n\u2022 Urban heat island mitigation \u2022 Carbon sequestration \u2022 Cleaner air\n\u2022 Community character \u2022 Aesthetic value\nSometimes metaphors can help explain complex topics. For some, the reasons for planting street trees help illustrate the relationship between resilience and sustainability.\nL RESILIENCE:\n\u2022 Summer cooling \u2022 Reduced storm runoff \u2022 Species diversification \u2022 Neighborhood identity\nBOULDER'S APPROACH TO RESILIENCE\nCITY RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK\nThe City Resilience Framework (CRF) provides a lens to understand the complexity of cities and the drivers that contribute to their resilience, and a common language that enables cities to share knowledge and experiences. The framework is built on four essential dimensions of urban resilience: Leadership & Strategy, Health & Wellbeing, Economy & Society, and Infrastructure & Environment. Each dimension contains three \u201cdrivers,\u201d which reflect the actions cities can take to improve their resilience.\nLeadership & Strategy\nThe processes that promote effective leadership, inclusive\ndecision-making, empowered stakeholders and integrated planning.\nHealth & Wellbeing:\nEveryone living and working in the city has access to what they need to survive and thrive.\nEconomy & Society\nThe social and financial systems that enable urban populations to live peacefully and act collectively.\nInfrastructure & Environment\nThe physical and natural systems that provide critical services and protect and connect urban assets, enabling the flow of goods, services and knowledge.\nThe Process\nBuilding resilience is as much a process as it is a set of outcomes. The process itself must also embody the characteristics of resilient systems and be iterative, inclusive, integrated, adaptive and flexible. It must allow for the constant infusion of new information and\naccommodate often unpredictable change in the community, creating the ability for\nreassessment and reprioritization of activity to address new risks and opportunities.\nFrom the outset, Boulder's goal has been to do things differently. The city set off to build on existing efforts, but recognized the opportunity to tap into the new energy around the 100 Resilient Cities network. For example, the city has explored new methods for community engagement and ownership through the MIT Climate CoLab, harnessing the creative potential of the whole community, and Growing Up Boulder (GUB), giving voice to youth in the process. This approach has given us the chance to position Boulder as a resilience testbed for new technologies, innovative partnerships and creative thinking.\nIn 2014, the city initiated its first resilience assessment, ultimately leading to the creation of this strategy. The assessment methodology was an analysis of current efforts that support resilience and identified important gaps in knowledge, capacity and activity. However, this initial assessment process itself highlighted areas where the existing methodology could be augmented by new diagnostics to be incorporated in future resilience assessments. New elements being developed as part of Boulder's resilience efforts will bring insights and depth of analysis for the continuous process of\nreflection and assessment.\nWHAT ARE THE PLATFORM PARTNERS?\nThe 100RC Platform of Partners provides member cities with a curated suite of donated tools and services, supplied by partners from the private, public, academic, and non-profit sectors, to support cities in their resilience-building activities. Boulder has already partnered with a number of these service providers, including Trimble, a company that provides geospatial technical solutions and domains to capture, measure, analyze, monitor and share built and environmental information.\n\u25a0 BOULDER'S STRATEGIES\nTHROUGH THE RESILIENCE assessment and community discussions, Boulder has identified three major resilience strategies. Working collaboratively to create actions that achieve these interconnected strategies will help build a resilient and adaptive community that is better able to address the unpredictable impacts of environmental, social and economic shocks and stresses.\nBuilding community resilience is a never-ending process and requires constant adjustment to new conditions and opportunities. At its heart, building community resilience is about social cohesion and the connections between and among people and organizations. The design and implementation of each of these strategies, actions and frontiers is intended to create new or amplify existing bonds to build our collective resilience, regardless of the threat we face. Through the actions identified here, we take steps towards meeting these goals, but as noted earlier, these are not the first steps. These new actions add to ongoing and historic efforts in a way that brings intentional direction toward catalyzing change across all sectors of the community.\nStrategies\nThe following three strategies represent the main action areas for the city:\n| CONNECT AND PREPARE - Prepare all segments of the community for uncertainty and disruption by encouraging community\npreparedness, creating a culture of risk awareness and personalizing resilience.\nJ PARTNER AND INNOVATE - Capitalize on the collective problem-solving and creativity of our community by leveraging advances in data, research and observations to address emerging resilience challenges.\n| TRANSFORM AND INTEGRATE - Embed resilience into city operations and systems by transforming our approach to community resilience.\nActions\nThese are immediate priority activities to be implemented over the next two to three years that take advantage of partnerships and resources catalyzed by the 100RC network and program. The actions being proposed are intended to be responsive to existing city priorities and bring a resilience lens and added value to projects and initiatives that are already underway.\nA summary table of all the proposed activities is provided at the end of this document.\nFrontiers\nTransformative investments in community resilience that currently have no models to emulate, represent extremely complex areas for action and\/or require an extensive community conversation to be successful.\nDeploy a community driven, interactive \u201cMobile Resilience Lab.\u201d\nIn partnership with BoCo Strong, the collaborative countywide resilience building organization, the City of Boulder will bring resilience and preparedness activities directly\ninto neighborhoods and communities through a \u201cMobile Resilience Lab.\u201d The lab will be a highly interactive space that accommodates programming as varied as developing your own bee-safe garden to creating personalized blueprints for individual resilience to building disaster \u201cgo kits.\u201d Deploying a mobile lab recognizes that true resilience building occurs first and foremost at home and in your own neighborhood, with the people and places you know best. The lab will provide a fun and dynamic platform for building relationships around preparedness and will, literally, be a vehicle for the community to share challenges and solutions. By meeting people where they are, the city will deepen public ownership of resiliency and seek to address community concerns about the responsiveness and transparency of government.\nDevelop a volunteer community preparedness program.\nA key to effective and successful disaster response is community and individual preparedness. Boulder's formal emergency response capabilities are well-resourced and\neffective; however, local neighborhoods and communities need to be better prepared and possess a deeper capacity to be first responders while formal systems gear up for relief operations. The city will develop a community-centered course to enhance emergency preparedness, emphasizing social connections and risk awareness as core personal resilience attributes. Developing a more robust and flexible capacity to respond to crisis when it occurs is a direct outcome of lessons learned from recent disasters.\nIdentify risks to future economic vitality.\nEnsuring the continuing vitality of the local economy is an essential component of long-term community resilience. The City of Boulder will incorporate an analysis of the local business community's vulnerability to disruptions in core infrastructure provision, workforce availability and financial services into an update to the Economic Sustainability Strategy. Boulder will also explore whether there are latent vulnerabilities to larger macro-economic trends that the city can plan for proactively. Cyclical swings in the economy are normal and are predictable stresses whose effects can be minimized through thoughtful preparation.\nRESILIENCY ADVISORS\nDuring the 2013 flood, even before the rain had stopped falling, thousands of volunteers were out helping neighbors,\nfriends and strangers protect their homes and clean up debris. This outpouring of assistance reflected the best of Boulder's spirit and was a vital unplanned resource during the flood recovery. However, without the coordination to direct, equip and support these activities, volunteers can place themselves in danger and unintentionally hamper or overwhelm formal responses. Recognizing the need to create the capacity to welcome this energetic community support, the City of Boulder, the newly-formed Boulder County Volunteers Active in Disaster (VOAD) and 100 Resilient Cities Platform Partner, Resiliency Advisors, partnered to deliver the \u201cLeading and Managing Community Volunteers in Disaster\u201d workshop. During this best practices workshop to manage and marshal spontaneous volunteerism, participants engaged in sharing lessons learned, assessing future risks and resourcing mapping, as well as applying proven disaster management concepts to manage spontaneous volunteers. Post session, the group was provided an after action report that outlined next steps including a strong focus on Volunteer Reception Center training. The session was delivered by Lisa Orloff, president of Resiliency Advisors.\nPARTNERSHIP WITH WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND\nWellington, New Zealand is a 100 Resilient Cities network city that is recognized globally for its community disaster\npreparedness program. Wellington's approach integrates volunteerism, community-based trainings and a network of\ndistrict disaster hubs to create a multi-tiered preparedness and response capability across their region. Wellington's\nsuccess rests largely on the accessibility of training courses to a wide range of community members, as well as an\ninnovative approach to regularly scheduled activities that create new opportunities for community interaction with the program. In May 2016, experts from Wellington, NZ will visit with city staff and community organizations in a weeklong workshop to design and implement activities that will prepare the community for the next disaster.\nSTRATEGY 1 - CONNECT & PREPARE\nFacilitate the use of continuity planning strategies with local businesses.\nThe sooner local businesses return to normal operations after a disaster, the faster the surrounding neighborhoods and city recover. We will collaborate with public and private institutions and organizations to identify best practices; facilitate the use of continuity plan templates and other resources; develop policies and procedures for improved situational awareness; coordinate between business support organizations; and communicate with businesses after a disaster. Ultimately it is in each organization's interest to proactively plan for uncertainty and disruption, but our community at large has a clear stake in helping all businesses weather the inevitable crises and bounce back faster and better.\nDevelop rapid post-disaster impact assessment capacity in partnership\nwith the local business community.\nThe ability for businesses to rapidly access resources and financial assistance after a disaster is essential for the successful return to operations. Each day that businesses remains idle represents lost revenue, wages and taxes, eliminating vital infusions of financial capital just when a community needs it most. Boulder will partner with local businesses and associations to develop the necessary capacity, relationships and systems to quickly and efficiently collect impact information and data, access recovery funds and return businesses to operation after a disaster with minimal disruption. The city will also explore the creation of a Business Disaster Assistance Center that would become operational when needed. By developing a user-friendly process to address gaps in our response to the 2013 flood, we are preparing for future uncertainty.\nEngage the creative power of the arts to convey and\ninvolve people in complex risk and resilience themes.\nMobilizing action at a broad scale also requires varied ways of communicating complex topics so that they are relatable and actionable to the diverse residents that make up our community. Breaking from the traditional model of community engagement, we will invest in the creative talent of our visual artists, filmmakers, poets, theatre-makers, dancers and musicians to broaden our vision, discussion and experience of risk and resilience. By enhancing our collective thinking about resilience and exploring creative ways to communicate it, we will broaden the circle of community ownership, action and perspective. This effort will lead to creative insights and solutions from community members who might not otherwise participate.\nYOUTH \"SHINE\" IN PERFORMANCE FOR RESILIENCE\nPerformance can be a dynamic tool for including youth\nparticipation in authoring our city's plan for resilience. Shine is a musical performance that weaves climate science and artist expression into a funny and powerful story that spans 300 million years of geological time to convey how humanity and climate are interrelated. Performed at NCAR in Boulder in June 2015 as a collaboration between NCAR scientists, Beth Osnes at CU and Boulder's youth, rehearsing each part of the musical led participants through different aspects of climate science, from dancing the various phases of\nphotosynthesis to creating\nflags to representing the ways\nin which our city utilizes fossil\nfuels. This show has gone on\nto engage youth in other\n100 Resilient Cities, including\nNewYork City and London,\nwith Durban, South Africa and\nNew Orleans to come.\nINVEST IN THE FUTURE\nThe capital budgeting process is the critical intersection between public policy and program implementation. Given limited resources, city officials must choose among competing priorities.These choices are often significantly determined by the criteria that are used to prioritize and rank public expenditures. Given the relatively recent emergence of resilience capacity-building as a public policy priority, there are few formal evaluation criteria built into the capital planning process that provide guidance on how to weigh the costs of proposed actions against potential benefits. This is essential to enable systematic consideration of proposed resilience actions and measures against other priorities.\nCurrently, for example, city investments and budgets do not specifically consider likely climate impact on city systems, nor are there mechanisms for internalizing the cost implications of the city's commitment to a zero-carbon energy policy. It is important to have valuation mechanisms that evaluate the potential cost of carbon and the potential for future constraints on carbon emissions. Implementing climate risk screening mechanisms in the Capital Improvement Program or internalizing the carbon cost of projects will reprioritize budgets and drive new conversations about risk and resilience tradeoffs across the entire city organization.\nACTIONS:\nCreate a \"citizen science\" program to foster the co-creation of knowledge\nDesign and conduct a local food system assessment.\nSpur creative representation of data through investments in artistic visualization and knowledge display.\nDrive the creative use of community data through competitive challenges and hackathons.\nPURPOSE:\nRESILIENCE VALUE:\nCreate a \u201ccitizen science\u201d program to foster the co-creation of knowledge.\nCitizen science can take many forms, but as technologies have advanced over the last decade, each member of the community can now serve as independent,\nmobile data-collecting participants. To harness this potential, the city will develop the information architecture necessary to support community-driven mobile science\napplications and translate that data into information and metrics to inform city decision-making. The aggregation of information from so many data points can create new insights into changes in the community, collective behavior or climate, as examples. By relying on community members to play a role in the creation of data and shared knowledge, Boulder will foster co-ownership in understanding the factors of change affecting us all. The underlying architecture will be openly available to the public to creatively develop applications to support data collection from sources as diverse as the Boulder Valley School District to Boulder's active and enthusiastic outdoor\ncommunity.\nDesign and conduct a local food system assessment.\nBoulder's passion for safe, local and ethical food has made the community a global hub for natural foods.\nAs a leader in the natural and organic industry, Boulder has world-class, locally sourced restaurants and has made\nrevolutionary contributions to natural food packaging and labeling. However, Boulder needs a better understanding of what role locally produced food can play in buffering the community from a disruption in national or global food or transportation systems. The city will conduct an entirely new food security assessment, deviating from traditional scales of analysis and definitions of \u201csecurity.\u201d An assessment of this type will require a broad range of partnerships from the business, agricultural, transportation and water sectors, among others, to understand how changes in the complex dynamics of the food production, delivery and consumption system can both be impacted by disruption, but also meaningfully mitigated by local action.\nSpur creative representation of data through artistic visualization and knowledge display.\nNew capabilities created by the integration of enhanced computational power, big data and visual representation systems\nprovide the opportunity to bring many previously complex and abstract concepts into stunning visual relief for the first time. The city will convene some of the world's great artists and media professionals to work with scientists, librarians and city officials to develop and refine some of these data visualization systems to create a compelling community education and communication approach. Boulder will work with partners to put the vast amount of collected scientific and citizen science data in the hands of artists and hackers, giving them the tools they need to interpret and represent the data in a clear,\nresonant message. An emphasis will be placed on creating a variety of pathways, tools and systems to enhance accessibility to a wide an array of prospective users. Through these creative partnerships, the city will unleash untapped knowledge to inform decisions and mobilize collective action\nDrive the creative use of community data through competitive challenges and hackathons.\nAs part of an ongoing effort to democratize the city's data through community dashboarding and a more accessible open-data portal, Boulder will create data and\ntechnology challenges to encourage the use of city and community data. These challenges are dynamic competitions intended to focus the creative and entrepreneurial talent of the city to help identify and solve collective problems. Similarly, the city will partner with the local coding and tech community to host hackathons\u2014events that focus intense programming attention toward a collaborative solution to a single, discrete issue. Taken together, this approach taps into two powerful behavioral\nmotivators\u2014competition and collaboration\u2014to find solutions to particularly complex resilience issues.\nUNDERSTANDING RISK: BOULDER\nIn October 2015, the City of Boulder, in partnership with Ushahidi, a 100 Resilient Cities Platform Partner, the University of Colorado, the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) and several local technology companies, hosted a two-day event called Understanding Risk Boulder (URBoulder). URBoulder convened the talent and expertise of the region's communities, scientists, technologists and government to develop a shared understanding of the challenges faced in building\nlong-term resilience to natural hazards; understand the impacts of climate change; and develop innovative solutions to meet them.\nIn conjunction with UR Boulder, Ushahidi hosted a Tech Challenge that sought to use open-source technology to improve resilience in Boulder and strengthen\ncommunity engagement. The UR Boulder Tech Challenge was designed to identify technological gaps in the resilience landscape of Boulder and provide seed\nfunding for innovate solutions to them. The challenge was funded by The Rockefeller Foundation.\nSTRATEGY 2 - PARTNER & INNOVATE\n\"We are working on a wide array of policies, programs and projects to reduce emissions and realize other important community outcomes. We know that long-term success will require better feedback loops, honest assessment, persistence and collective action.\"\n- City of Boulder's 2016 Climate Commitment Framework\nExtreme weather events have created a call to action for deploying more resilient power systems. Communities face a growing number of stresses that pose risks to their energy systems and economies. These include aging infrastructure in need of costly maintenance upgrades and severe weather events. Energy efficiency and local power generation are strategies that enhance the resilience of energy systems and the communities they serve.\nBoulder is committed to transitioning to a no-carbon energy system as part of its climate action plan. This wholesale transformation will fundamentally alter the landscape of energy production, storage, distribution and use in ways that are only now being fully explored. With this transition comes an additional opportunity\u2014a chance to apply core resilience principles, such as flexibility, redundancy and robustness, as additional drivers of the system design. Many of the renewable energy sources we rely on as part of our strategies for reducing carbon are well suited to serve as the backbone for a resilient energy system.\nThe city aims to improve resiliency and address economic and environmental concerns by prioritizing a local, clean energy system that combines Boulder-based generation, integrated storage and other distributed energy resources, increasing clean energy opportunities to low-income communities and protecting vulnerable populations by serving critical power needs. It will require careful consideration and extensive design, partnerships that span the entire community, and, ultimately, a collective leap of faith and the willingness to embrace change, even when the outcome is not yet entirely clear.\nACTIONS:\nEnsure the continuity of all critical life-safety services at a network of community resilience centers.\nBuild climate preparedness capacity across the city organization.\nIntegrate resilience principles into Boulder's Sustainability Framework.\nIntegrate resilience into the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan.\nDevelop an integrated approach to managing ecosystems and green infrastructure.\nPURPOSE:\nRESILIENCE VALUE:\nEnsure the continuity of all critical life-safety services at a network of community resilience centers.\nRecent events have highlighted the extreme vulnerabilities and interdependencies of core life-safety infrastructure and utilities (e.g. energy, water and sanitation) and the need for their combined secure, continuous operation during crisis. Advance planning for large-scale, high-impact events is critical to ensuring that these incidents do not overwhelm either immediate response capabilities or the long-term well-being of highly vulnerable segments of Boulder's community. The city will design and implement a communitywide network of resilience centers that ensures continuity of critical community services, protection for high-risk populations and infrastructure, and an enhanced capacity to provide and maintain basic services at a neighborhood scale, and develop the capacity to \u2018island' critical infrastructure provision without jeopardizing core life-safety functions. These resilience centers will contain small-scale or compartmentalized infrastructure systems that can operate independent of the larger utility system to sustain a sheltering facility during wide-scale disruption.\nBoulder will also create place-based platforms for assembly, cooperation and education. By basing and delivering community outreach, activities and other functions (e.g., mobile farmers markets, food trucks, fix it clinics, recycling support, etc.) from these locations, these centers can be integrated into the new focus on neighborhood- based engagement during good times as well as crisis. The likely integration of significant renewable energy assets at these locations can also provide foundational elements for a distributed energy system that could include neighborhood-based load balancing through on-site battery storage, neighborhood microgrid development or other emerging decentralized energy utility models.\nBy thoughtfully investing in public safety infrastructure as a response to lessons learned in previous events, the city can weave in multiple additional community benefits such as neighborhood development and energy transition.\nBuild climate preparedness capacity across the city organization.\nMost of the city's climate risk is tied to larger scale changes in the global and regional climate, and the community's understanding of those impacts at the local scale is inconsistent. This is in part because of the complexities of Boulder's local topography, but also because the city currently uses a wide variety of models, methods and analysis to characterize potential \u201cfutures.\u201d In order to efficiently and effectively plan for Boulder's future climate impacts, the city will systematize the use of climate information across all departments and city functions in a way that is scientifically robust yet retains appropriate flexibility.\nCLIMATE LEADERS PROGRAM\nThe City of Boulder will pilot a program to train department leaders, from Human Resources and Finance to Utilities and Parks and Recreation, in the science of climate change so that everyday decisions across the organization can be informed by a consistent foundation of knowledge and understanding.\nSCENARIO PLANNING\nWe must prepare to accommodate a much wider range of possible future environmental, social and economic conditions than in the past. Part of the solution is to design a scenario-based process for planning that allows us to test programs, actions and investments against different plausible potential future conditions and prioritize actions that represent \u201cno or low regrets\u201d strategies. \u201cNo or low regrets\u201d strategies are those that are sound investments and adaptations regardless of the severity of future change.\nBy investing in the core capacity of city staff to understand climate science and impacts, and by developing flexible mechanisms to plan for a range of potential climate impacts, Boulder is creating the adaptive governance structures necessary to address the wide-ranging effects that climate change will have on all functions of government.\nIntegrate resilience principles into Boulder's Sustainability Framework.\nBoulder's Sustainability Framework is the unifying mechanism that connects all of the city's policies and programs, and therefore represents the best point for integrating the resilience principles that will have the greatest impact across all of Boulder's departments and functions. The Sustainability Framework has been used successfully in practice for several years, informing the city's policies, budget prioritization and program design. The Boulder community has a deeply embedded sense of sustainability as a core\nvalue system, manifested through the well-established framework, among many other community-driven initiatives. Resilience, however, is a relatively new and emerging\nconcept being systematically applied as a practice in cities for the first time. By thoughtfully integrating resilience into a familiar and operational framework,\nresilience activity will be placed in a relatable and immediately actionable context.\nIntegrate resilience into the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan.\nThe Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan (BVCP) serves as the city's highest level policy document, articulating the\ncommunity's vision and core values. The BVCP contains sustainability principles and policies and chapters that convey\ndiscrete topics such as land use, transportation, housing and economy. By integrating new resilience policies and strategies into the BVCP, the plan can address key elements of a healthy, stable and adaptive community, reflect and address Boulder's highest risks so the community can be adaptive, underscore connectively between systems and vulnerabilities, and illustrate ways that the BVCP can address Boulder's resilience, not only in times of disruption and crisis, but also on a day-to-day basis and over the long term. Integrating resilience into the BVCP will leverage interdisciplinary expertise and generate strategies that are responsive to Boulder's challenges, as well as align activities and priorities across city departments.\nDevelop an integrated approach to managing ecosystems and green infrastructure.\nBy creating an integrated management plan, Boulder will support its complex local ecosystem and plan for the systemic stresses and changes anticipated with climate\nchange impacts. As part of Boulder's long history of progressive planning, the city actively manages many aspects of the ecosystem, including monitoring wildlife-human\ninteractions, maintaining a healthy forest canopy and conducting regular riparian renewal and restoration efforts. The success of these programs contributes to the city's rich quality of life and sense of community. These programs also add to the ongoing success of Boulder's signature planning achievement\u2014the vast greenbelt of open space that encircles the city. Building on these efforts, Boulder will develop an integrated strategy that aims to knit disparate efforts to create a single management plan that will\nevaluate new opportunities and maximize value around existing and future green infrastructure planning initiatives.\nTRIMBLE AND DIGITALGLOBE\nBoulder's urban forest faces unique challenges due to both the higher stresses already caused by geographic conditions and the onset of diseases and exotic pests such as the recently arrived Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). Given these factors and the need to develop a more robust set of urban forest management tools, the City of Boulder partnered with 100RC Platform Partners Trimble and DigitalGlobe to map the urban tree canopy.\nDigitalGlobe was able to provide Boulder with the high-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery needed to extract, map, and measure the trees throughout the city.\nTrimble presented an initial citywide urban tree canopy analysis, as well as provided free training to city staff on the use of the eCognition software necessary to map\nchanges to the urban tree canopy over time.\nThe result provided the city with a baseline to prioritize future management plans and track green infrastructure changes whether through loss due to EAB infestation or gain through green infrastructure improvements. The urban tree canopy analysis will be published in Boulder's Open Data Catalog. In addition to working with Boulder, Trimble and DigitalGlobe are assessing how to replicate and offer similar outcomes to other municipalities based on the work done and lessons learned with Boulder.\nTRAINING THE HOMELESS TO TURN\n\"TREE DEBRIS TO OPPORTUNITY\"\nThe City of Boulder has won a prestigious Knight Cities Challenge grant to develop an innovative program that will train homeless community members to turn trees impacted by Emerald Ash Borer into beautiful products. This 18-month project addresses a variety of community challenges, including Emerald Ash Borer infestation and homelessness. The program, called Tree Debris to Opportunity, was one of 37 recipients chosen by the Knight Cities Challenge for support and funding. The city's application was submitted in partnership with the Bridge House and Library Maker Space.\nThe goal is to engage the Boulder community in repurposing Ash tree debris to usable products to be sold back to the community. The program will hire participants of the Bridge House Ready to Work program. These individuals will complete a multi-month apprenticeship at the Maker Space, located in the Main Library, to learn how to become woodworkers. The group will make products that will then be sold at the Farmers Market and other locations. Public classes will also be offered for free. The Bridge House participants will help teach and facilitate the classes, encouraging collaboration between all members of the community. The project is expected to begin in mid- to late summer and is made possible through the generous support of the Knight Cities Challenge. The grant amount totals $200,000.\nHuman Services provides vital support for large segments of the Boulder community through grants to community agencies, direct services and community capacity-building partnerships. These programs provide a range of community services for vulnerable residents\u2014from access to mental and physical health, child care and family support to emergency services.The 2016 revision to the Human Services Strategy seeks to shift how Human Services conducts business, away from primarily tracking program-based success metrics, such as the number of shelter beds filled or meals served, to a predictive and adaptive service provision based on achieving social outcomes. This shift will allow us to identify \"tipping points\"in the social safety net that cause individuals and families to move from relative stability into homelessness. It will allow us to monitor for those changes and preemptively adjust resources to avoid them.\nHomelessness represents a profound threshold for the most vulnerable in our society and once crossed, individuals and families encounter significantly more social, economic and health barriers. Reducing homelessness not only brings obvious and important benefits for the individuals and families involved, but ultimately saves substantial resources in the social safety net that can be redirected toward additional positive investments. Boulder is a prosperous and innovative city, and it has pioneered many important cultural and environmental issues. Thus, developing new ways to assist residents with the greatest needs, so that no one falls into homelessness, is a resilience frontier.\nThe actions listed to the right showcase many of the resilience activities the city is currently undertaking across the community. Boulder has taken inspiration and learned from its successes in the design of the new actions proposed earlier in this strategy. However, the list is not comprehensive - Boulder is doing much more.

This document is the product of three years of research, analysis and dynamic stakeholder input. It is reflective of the strengths inherent within our community, as well as responsive to the challenges we face in the 21st century. The approaches delineated here are built upon a strong foundation of best practices learned from experience as one of the first of the 100\nResilient Cities in the world, as well as from our long history as a strong binational\nmetroplex - at the border of 3 states and 2 countries. Our city is appreciative of the opportunity presented to us by the 100 Resilient Cities program, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. We would like to acknowledge the tremendous support and encouragement we have received from the 100RC team, and the network of what is now a full 100 cities globally.\nAs our community grapples with many challenges, the City of El Paso continues to press forward. Building prosperity for our people, and sustainability for our city, with innovative and collaborative solutions. In order to achieve that kind of future, regardless of any barrier or challenge in our path, our actions must move beyond our ability to survive and reach toward our capacity to thrive.\nAs you read this document, I hope that you gain a sense of the potential that exists within this community. So many El Pasoans have participated in the strategy building process. That participation has been invaluable and has only reaffirmed that the people of El Paso remain our greatest community asset. Together we will move toward the goals of Resilient El Paso.\nMayor Dee Margo City of El Paso\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to congratulate the City of El Paso on the release of \u201cResilient El Paso,\u201d the city's Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for the city and 100RC's partnership with it.\nA quintessential frontier town, El Paso is a modern binational city with over 350 years of continuous settlement. The city's stark geography is both beautiful and harsh, a desert environment with a fragile ecosystem that must support a growing population and the pressures of the border. As cities increasingly face uncertainties around water, the threat of rising temperatures, and rapid urbanization, El Paso can serve as a model to others in its experience thriving in the desert, living within its\nmeans, and using its unique resources.\nResilient El Paso builds on the city's strengths and provides new approaches to address these interrelated challenges. Several of its initiatives address environmental challenges while also integrating social considerations, such as the revitalization and repurposing of Cohen Stadium, which will catalyze future development in northeast El Paso. It also focuses on implementing Civic Design Labs that will engage with the community and relevant stakeholders to maximize resilience value as the city undertakes major capital projects, policy initiatives and strategy planning updates. Through actions and goals like these, Resilient El Paso sets forth mechanisms for concrete change that will benefit all who live there.\nAlready we have seen the impact of our collaboration - the city's Strategic Plan incorporates many of initiatives developed by the city's resilience team. With this document, El Paso becomes even better poised to achieve all of its priorities.\nThe support of Mayor Dee Margo and City Manager Tommy Gonzalez, along with former Mayor Oscar Leeser, was critical to this Strategy, as was the hard work and dedication of Nicole Ferrini, who led El Paso's resilience work throughout the development of this Strategy.\nWhile the release of this Strategy marks an important achievement, the work is far from over. It will require continued effort and unwavering commitment to realize the vision outlined in these pages. We are excited to continue our partnership with the city and to watch and participate in the work as it unfolds.\nMichael Berkowitz President, 100 Resilient Cities\nAs El Paso approaches the culmination of more than two years of engagement with 100 Resilient Cities, we are proud to announce the release of El Paso's inaugural Resilience Strategy. This work is the result of a citywide effort to strengthen our built environment, adapt our governance and economy, and prepare our communities for whatever weather extremes or social challenges may confront us in the future.\nAs part of the El Paso Resilience Strategy, four goals key to moving forward have been set:\n\u2022 Sustainable and adaptive city infrastructure systems, both public and private.\n\u2022 Creation of innovative pathways toward economic prosperity for all El Pasoans.\n\u2022 Empowering El Pasoans to move our community forward and strengthen our city. \u2022 Enabling a collaborative and reflective government, responsive to the needs of the\ncommunity and engaged as a global leader.\nEach goal contains a series of defined strategies and even more detailed actions that function as a road map for the future of our city. In order to guide the execution of the Strategy, the City of El Paso has embedded its spirit and specific projects into our new \u201c20 in 2020\u201d visionary initiatives. The resilience process furthermore expands upon successes resulting from El Paso's 2008 Livable City Sustainability Plan as well as our award-winning Comprehensive Plan. Throughout the development of the Resilience Strategy, the City worked across departments and agencies to ensure alignment with the El Paso Strategic Plan, and to build a resilience lens into all eight of its strategic goals.\nMembership in the 100 Resilient Cities Network has pushed us to look beyond the daily concerns caused by environmental challenges in a desert ecosystem, and toward a holistic vision of long-term prosperity and quality of life. The City of El Paso is anxious to move forward with our resilience journey, and is committed to sharing best practices among all 100 of our sister cities in across this innovative network.\nTommy Gonzalez City Manager City of El Paso\nResilience is about a community's ability to respond positively to change. Change occurs as transformational shifts at environmental, economic, and societal levels. A smart, sustainable approach to solutions addressing those shifts can propel a community toward a positive future. El Paso's ability to be resilient lies in the strength of our culture, our capacity for public engagement and the positive manner in which we choose to shape our own future. As a native El Pasoan, I am keenly aware of the inherent strength of our community as well as the often overwhelming challenges we face. It has been that awareness, alongside my love for El Paso, that has inspired\nme to take on the challenge of building urban resilience for our beautiful city.\nOver the last three years l have placed all of my personal and professional energy into an ongoing effort to understand how to create a more resilient and sustainable El Paso. I have studied our city in depth, her shape, her movement, her culture, her people and found that the city is in itself an agent of change. To change the environment in which a child is educated is to change her learning potential; to change her learning potential is to elevate her opportunity for success. To increase connectivity, communication capacity and access to services and resources changes a community's ability not only to respond to crisis, but its ability to thrive, growing toward a positive future. The goal should not be to simply achieve sustainability, but to flourish well beyond immediate necessity toward long term prosperity and quality of life.\nAs El Pasoans, we wear the ability to bounce back in the face of adversity like a badge of honor. It's in our history, inherent in our many cultures and now it represents our future, a path toward prosperity and a high quality of life standard. The stakes are too high to proceed with business as usual. It is time for us to come together, each taking personal responsibility for the shape of things to come. Here are a few thoughts on how we begin:\nForge a collaborative path forward and lead by example.\nThe path forward is challenging. The next steps will emerge out of an all-inclusive platform of empowered stakeholders not a small group of individual interests. Gathering ideas that align with our own preconceived notions is easy. Embracing alternative viewpoints and incorporating them into a common goal presents the challenge.\nA successful resilience strategy for El Paso will depend on community. The paradigm shift of the new millennium dictates that successful policy be initiated from the grass\nroots level up, not the other way around. In order to build community capacity and reach critical mass, the plan will have to catalyze local non-profits, professional trade organizations, faith based initiatives, social justice groups, regional business and others alongside policy makers and leaders.\nAcknowledge the complexity of the challenge, leverage the maximum variety of resources and question everything.\nThe notion of widespread engagement is larger than simply gathering ideas from a variety of groups. The concept of resilience is reflected in many facets: economics, politics, security, health, wellness, education, technology, climate, the built environment and most of all human behavior. The real trick is to recognize that none of these exist in isolation. Their inherent and universal connection presents both the challenge and the opportunity. The challenge is in overcoming barriers between disparate concepts and ideas. The opportunity lies in our ability to leverage the strength of those disparate groups and the knowledge of a thousand different fields of expertise. Forging a path toward success also means challenging assumptions, questioning standards and pushing limits. El Paso must be unafraid to challenge old assumptions, looking beyond the model for immediate gratification toward an aggressive yet pragmatic plan for the future.\nEstablish accountability metrics and a system of supportive governance ensuring a legacy of resilience beyond the initial movement.\nMeasuring the results of plan implementation is as important as the plan itself. Locally, we have seen an excess of plans emerge and fade without significant impact. Real time accountability focused on systemic feedback will allow our strategy to flex when necessary, to be resilient within itself. Critical metrics for a legacy of resilience will include shifting economic development indicators, educational opportunities, access to services, population based behavioral changes and capacity for safe failure. How we choose to respond to this data will determine the future resilience and prosperity of our community.\nThis report is more than an assembly of information. It is a roadmap to our resilient future. It is a challenge to all El Pasoans; the future is what we make it, let's start building it together! It's time to hit the ground running El Paso!\nNicole Ferrini\nChief Resilience Officer City of El Paso\nRecognizing vulnerability in ourselves is difficult. However, understanding our own challenges is the first step toward building strength. Over the last three years, the city resilience team has taken a deep dive into the areas where our community can do better. The story that follows illustrates the emergence a different approach to the challenges we face as a city.\n10\nTHE 100RC OPPORTUNITY FOR EL PASO\n100 Resilient Cities\u2014Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century.\n100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks\u2014earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.\u2014but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis.\n100 Resilient Cities aims to catalyze a global movement of resilience beyond it's 100 member cities. El Paso has been given the opportunity to contribute to that worldwide vision. However, in order for us to stand, shoulder to shoulder, with our sister cities on the global stage, it is first necessary for us to understand ourselves. The El Paso context is unique in the world. The following resilience strategy is an exploration of that uniqueness and the potential that it offers.\nThere are two major challenges inherent in cities that CRO's pioneering this work face:\n\u2022 First, cities are complex systems made of an array of smaller, distinct actors like government agencies, local businesses, and offices of international organizations; and they often don't communicate or interact with one another as much as they should;\n\u2022 Second, the solutions cities develop are often not treated as scalable knowledge. Cities regularly solve problems that already have been addressed by other cities, when instead they could be modifying solutions and lessons learned, tailoring them to be more effective and cost-efficient.\nThe Chief Resilience Officer is the centerpiece of 100RC's vision for helping cities deal with both of these challenges, while empowering them to develop improved urban resilience.\nOver the past two years the City of El Paso, led by the CRO, has focused on:\n\u2022 Working across government departments to help El Paso improve internal communications, and to address its own complexities. By facilitating communication that reaches across sometimes-significant internal divisions, the CRO promotes new collaboration, makes sure that offices aren't wasting resources doing duplicative work, and promotes synergy between the various projects and the plans that agencies are drafting.\n\u2022 Bringing together a wide array of stakeholders to explore our city's challenges and help build support for individual initiatives, and for resilience building in general. These stakeholders include government officials, and it is critical that representatives from the private sector, non-profits, and civil society are also included.\n\u2022 Leading the development of a core resilience strategy intended to identify El Paso's critical challenges, opportunities and capabilities, identifying the gaps between them.\n\u2022 Over the course of that work, the CRO brings the resilience lens to city problemsolving so that resources are leveraged holistically and projects planned for synergy. This lets the city get the most \u201cbang for its buck\u201d on its projects, potentially achieving multiple resilience goals with one project.\nThis document is a significant benchmark in the execution of this work. It will present a series of resilience-building initiatives, designed for El Paso, that in partnership with local stakeholders in addition to assistance from 100RC and our platform partners will pave the way toward a stronger, healthier and more prosperous future for our community.\nIn December of 2014, El Paso joined leading cities around the world in hiring its first Chief Resilience Officer (CRO). The CRO is an innovative position in city government that reports directly to the city's chief executive and acts as the city's point person for resilience building, coordinating across all of the city's resilience efforts.\nToday, the City of El Paso has now permanently incorporated the role of the Chief Resilience Officer within it's organizational structure. Beginning with the completion of this strategy, the Chief Resilience Officer will charged with stewardship of resilience practice as part of El Paso's future strategic planning as well as in regular municipal operations.\nFollowing the hire of the Chief Resilience Officer, the City of El Paso's Resilience Team was established as a mechanism to lead the integration of resilience across the organization. The introduction of resilience thinking in the context of city strategic planning allowed an opportunity for integration across mutiple areas of concern such as economic development, city planning, community development and municipal operations just to name a few.\nThe Resilience Team in close partnership with departmental leadership and the City Performance Office has worked to set the standard for embedding resilience thinking into city strategic planning as well as to institutionalize and operationalize resilience practice across the municipal organization.\nThe Strategic Planning Process (SPP) sets the tone and direction of service delivery by aligning core business processes and resource allocation with desired community results through eight identified goals. The budget process integrates these efforts by utilizing the same goal framework as the foundation to support key focus areas and fund established community priorities.\nGoal teams are a core element of this effort and consist of representation from every department at various levels. This ensures cross-functional collaboration as goal teams identify and produce measurable outcomes while pursuing strategic opportunities spanning over a one-year (short-term) and three-five year (longer-term) planning horizon. To promote a culture of innovation and enable agility, the Executive Leadership Team has empowered goal teams to bring recommendations on change initiatives at every corner of the SPP.\nStrategies, actions and tasks are developed in alignment with the eight strategic goals established. Performance measures and key performance indicators with annual targets are determined to ensure continuity and accountability. Industry benchmarks and other comparative data sources are used to determine competitive performance, with modifications made as necessary to allow for organizational agility and alignment during development and deployment.\nIn February 2017, the Mayor and City Council gathered for a strategic planning session where they reviewed accomplishments of the Strategic Plan and approved the addition of the \u201c20 in 2020\u201d visionary initiatives. Key strategic opportunities at the organizational scale are encapsulated in the \u201c20 in 2020\u201d visionary initiatives. As a key outcome of this session, resilience strategies were formally and unanimously adopted and integrated into the strategic plan to ensure focus on action.\nOpportunities for community input are embedded in each step of the SPP. Strategies, actions and tasks are dependent on community input through various mechanisms such as customer survey feedback, public comment during Council meetings, budget hearings, focus group meetings, community meetings and Town Hall presentations. Additionally, focus group discussions with key strategic partners are held to further enable a community dialogue.\nGoal team presentations are provided as public meetings and posted online to highlight progress, openly share updates on critical performance measures and as an additional feedback opportunity.\nLeadership + Strategy\nThe processes that promote effective leadership, inclusive decision-making, empowered stakeholders, and integrated planning.\nHealth + Wellbeing\nEveryone living and working in the city has access to what they need to survive and thrive.\nEconomy + Society\nThe social and financial systems that enable urban populations to live peacefully and act collectively.\nInfrastructure + Environment\nThe man-made and natural systems that provide critical services, protect, and connect urban assets enabling the flow of goods, services, and knowledge.\nAlignment of the City of El Paso mission vision and values to the City Resilience Framework formed the basis for building the resilience strategy.\nMISSION\nDeliver outstanding service to support a high quality of life for residents, businesses and visitors.\nVISION\nEl Paso will have safe and beautiful neighborhoods, a vibrant regional economy, and exceptional recreational, cultural and educational opportunities.\nVALUES\nIntegrity\nRespect\nExcellence\nAccountability\nPeople\nPHASE ONE\nPHASE TWO\nRESILIENCE\tRESILIENCE\tSTAKEHOLDER\tFULL INTEGRATION\nDIAGNOSTIC \/\tPRIORITIES\tENGAGEMENT\tOF RESILIENCE\nOPPORTUNITY\t\/ PROGRAM\t+ COMMUNITY\tWITH CITYWIDE\nASSESSMENT\tDEVELOPMENT\tALIGNMENT\tSTRATEGIC PLAN\nSPRING 2016\tSUMMER 2016\t2016\t2017\nResilience Strategy Development follows a two phase process. This document marks the culmination of two years of intensive engagement, research and planning. It is intended to provide a roadmap of actions that have the ability to make El Paso stronger, more adaptable and able to reach our full potential.\nEXTRAORDINARY ENGAGEMENT...\nImmediately following the Strategy Process Launch, the City of El Paso initiated a rigorous approach to stakeholder engagement. Starting with outreach to community leaders identified during the initial launch was pivotal to completing the appropriate outreach in a relatively short period of time, allowing the City of El Paso to catalyze external networks and resources. Key supporters during this early phase included Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, the Hospitals of Providence, The Paso Del Norte Health Foundation, The University of Texas at El Paso, Eco El Paso, the El Paso 911 District, the El Paso City County Office of Emergency Management alongside Regional Emergency Management partners and the Borderplex Alliance.\nASSESSING PERCEPTIONS...\nIn addition to formal stakeholder input sessions, the City of El Paso engaged in constant one-on-one meetings with individuals interested in building community resilience. Well over 1000 hours has been spent creating resonance around resilience in the context of our city...\nfor our people.\nFormal stakeholder engagement, dubbed Resilience Roundtables, were convened from May to June 2015. Eleven separate sessions across four broad topic areas informed a deep community-based perceptions assessment of current resilience conditions in El Paso. While each session was framed around a specific topic area, all were public and open to input from all sectors of interest. In a specific effort to engage a diverse set of stakeholders, these meetings were held at locations across the city at a variety of times, ensuring input on perceptions and ongoing activity from as many El Pasoans as possible.\nThe graphic at left\nis illustrative of the\ncompiled perceptions\nresulting from the eleven\nroundtable sessions. A\ncommon theme was\nthe need to engage and\nempower a broader range of stakeholders.\nEl Paso represents one half of the largest binational metroplex in the Western Hemisphere. Our regional population is expected to exceed 3 million by 2030. But more than just numbers, El Paso represents an opportunity to define the paradigm for the modern urban border environment. Within the fabric of our community there are an abundance of challenges to be met. However, exceeding those challenges are the number of opportunities in front of us. The ability to move beyond simple survival by intelligently adapting to the changing world around us is what presents our biggest barrier to a thriving future.\nA shock or stress leading a city to complete failure is not inevitable. Shocks and stresses can bring opportunities for cities as well. The experience may enable them to adapt, and in some cases, transform.\nCITY RESILIENCE\nIs the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt and thrive no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nSHOCK OR STRESS\n26\n100 Resilient Cities has recognized resilience as a critical part of the urban agenda, and an opportunity for cities, particularly rapidly growing cities, to ensure that their development can enhance rather than undermine their resilience.\n&\nO?\n\n\no*\n9^\n\n\nResilience doesn't just involve better understanding of hazards, risk assessments and taking action to reduce losses. It includes tackling underlying vulnerability and strengthening the city's ability to withstand, recover from, and adapt to whatever shocks and stresses the future holds.\nSocial\nCity Population (2017): 683,080 City Population Growth (2030): 734,031 City Population Density: 2,500\/sq mi Regional Population (2015): 2.5 million\nRegional Population Growth (2030): 3.4 million\nAnnual Growth Rate: 1.5%\nMedian Age: 32 Years\nPopulation Ethnicity: 78% Hispanic Veteran Population: 44,580 Foreign Born Residents: 24.4%\nSingle Family, Detached Housing: 25% Owner Occupied Housing: 59.2 % Housing Valued Under $200,000: 84%\nEnvironmental\nElevation: 3,800 Ft\nCity Land Area: 256 Sq Miles Annual Rainfall: 8 - 10 inches Annual Days of Sunshine: 297 Annual Triple Degree Days: 15.4 Highest # of Drought Days: 119\nUrban Tree Cover: 5.1% - 2.7 trees per acre\nNumber of Parks: 258\nEconomic\nMedian Household Income: $42,772 (71% of US Average)\nFamilies Below the Poverty Level: 21%\nUnemployment Rate: 4.0%\nHigh School Graduation or Higher: 78.6%\nBachelor's Degree or Higher: 22.7%\nPost Secondary Education: 5 Regional\nUniversities\nCurrent Enrollment in Higher Education:\n59,241\nRegional R+D Expenditures: $233 Million\nUTEP R+D Expenditures: $42,951,000\nUTEP Engineering R+D Expenditures:\n$26,108,000\nLargest international border in the world\n5 Inland Ports of Entry (3 within the City of El Paso)\n2nd Largest International Trade Crossing in the U.S.\nDesignated Safest City in America since\n2010\nFor over 350 years of continuous settlement, the people of El Paso have exemplified resilience, building a community that meets the challenges of a desert environment with its fragile ecosystem, weather extremes and variable water availability ranging from drought to flash flooding.\nAs a modern binational city, we have tried to match this resilience, even as population growth and migration have exacerbated environmental issues and created new challenges. We are dependent on the transport of food, water, and power to support a major urban center, yet our geographical and political boundaries work to concentrate transportation and communication arteries into a narrow, vulnerable corridor. Since we are on an international border, any meaningful response must be built on mutual respect and trust with our sister city in Mexico, Ciudad Juarez.\nOver the last ten years, El Paso suffered from two of the most severe shocks in recent community memory. In 2006, the city received the equivalent of two years annual rainfall over the course of just a few days. The ensuing flood was more than city systems were designed to handle at that time. The damage to both public and private property was in excess of $700 million, not to mention the cost of redesigning stormwater infrastructure for a city of 256 square miles in land area.\nIn 2011, just as the community was beginning to recover from the flooding, the city was hit by a severe freeze. Temperatures in our desert city plummeted in excess of 20\u00b0 F below anticipated lows. The community was not sufficiently prepared for the impact of such an event. The freeze caused infrastructure failure at both the residential and city scale, leaving many residents without power or access to water for several days.\nAs our community begins to better understand the shocks and stresses affecting our city, we also begin to understand the opportunities presented by those challenges. Over the last three years, the City of El Paso has identified a variety of areas where substantial action is needed to build long term resilience for our community. Pulling together solutions that cut across categories, address multiple challenges and create co-benefits for the entire community become the backbone of the this strategy.\nThe following pages illustrate a deep dive into the social, environmental and economic challenges facing El Paso.\nIn both of these cases, our community was not as resilient as we had hoped to be. Infrastructure failures across the city caused widespread damage with an alarmingly disproportionate impact on our most vulnerable residents. When analyzing our resilience in retrospect, it becomes evident that the severity of these events was a direct function of the chronic stresses present in our community rather than a function of the actual severity of the climatic event. It is the significant number of chronic stresses that continue to decrease our capacity to be adequately responsive not only to crisis events, but also affects our capacity to flourish socially or economically.\nTo develop El Paso's climate risk profile, the City of El Paso reviewed the city's most recent hazard mitigation report and inputs from the perceptions exercise. Findings showed that El Paso faces relatively limited risk from climate related shocks due to minimal probability of extreme level events. When placed in the context of other cities which face the impacts of sea level rise, hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, El Paso can be said to have a relatively stable climate. Risks posed by nature are frequently predictable and manageable under ideal circumstances. It is the previously identified chronic stresses that limit our capacity to respond to even medium level shocks that present the greatest risk to our community.\nExtreme climatic conditions in El Paso are defined by rapid changes to environmental conditions often occurring with great force over a condensed time frame. Shocks most relevant in our city include extreme heat, flash flooding, drought and sudden freezing conditions - in short, the effects of living in a desert environment.\n33\nPOVERTY\nOver a quarter of El Pasoans live below the federal poverty line with certain neighborhoods exceeding 40% of households in poverty. Median Household Income, at 71% of the US average, is approximately $42K annually. It is no coincidence that this statistic is often noted under both economic and social vulnerability. As many El Pasoans struggle to make ends meet their ability to bounce back when struck by shocks decreases as well. Individuals and families living below the poverty line are less able to take action when impacted by sudden flooding or soaring triple digit heat. In El Paso, high concentrations of poverty can be found clustered in the urban core. However, the number of low income neighborhoods are increasing toward the edges of the city particularly to the east. In many cases neighborhoods have been informally established and lack access to critical infrastructure.\nA large portion of El Paso families earn less than their counterparts across Texas. A substantial proportion of residents are considered very low-income, with the City's poverty rate greater than 20% (higher than the rate at the State level). While El Paso has a lower cost of living as compared to other cities in the United States, that fact does not sufficiently mitigate challenges related to pursuing increased quality of life or prosperity. High levels of poverty exacerbate other environmental and social challenges within the El Paso community. When exploring shocks and stresses impacting El Paso it's critical to consider amplification of impact within specific high poverty areas.\nUnlike many other cities around the world, access to basic utility services is not an issue across the majority of the City of El Paso. Affordability of those services, however, often presents an insurmountable barrier. El Pasoans at or below 50% of the federal poverty level spend up to 30% of household income toward the cost of electricity.\nThat means over 22,000 households in our community are energy challenged. Little to no widespread access to or knowledge of the value of energy efficiency and renewable energy strategy is present and there are insufficient resources available\nFitgouirme 1p0lement those strategies at the household level.

Recently-proposed increases in both base rates and solar customer demand charges present further barriers to the promulgation of residential scale renewable energy strategy. Home upgrades are particularly challenging in aging areas of the city. Efficiency efforts in historic homes and other structures often require significant and expensive upgrades. Additionally, residents in these neighborhoods are often elderly and survive on a fixed income incapable of supporting any up front cost impact. The graph at left indicates residential rates\nin Texas and New Mexico as well as rates in Ciudad Juarez.\nTRANSPORTATION NETWORKS\nEl Paso is a car-based city defined by miles of highways, arterials and disconnected neighborhood streets. Despite past efforts to shift toward a multi-modal community, the majority of El Pasoans continue to depend on single occupancy vehicles to access services across the city. According to the 2000 US Census, 92% of El Pasoans commute to work by car and the average household owns 1.7 vehicles. Efforts to\nalleviate congested traffic conditions by expanding the existing highway system are underway, generating a seemingly never-ending cycle of construction. Additional efforts to expand the public transportation system are also underway. Alternative transportation efforts have made great strides forward with the activation of a Bus Rapid Transit system called BRIO and the revitalization of the Downtown Streetcar Line. However, these systems are limited in their capacity to service the widespread sprawl of the city. At 256 square miles and growing, the physical expansion of our city is a barrier to comprehensive public transportation. This situation is particularly impactful to portions of the population in poverty, preventing access to basic services and thereby exacerbating other vulnerabilities. It's also critical to examine the cost impact of a lack of urban mobility in the context of the housing and transportation index. In many El Paso neighborhoods, residents can expect to spend upwards of 25% of their household income on transportation.\nAccording to the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT), the average cost for housing and transportation in El Paso neighborhoods is 60% of household income. Combined with cost of electricity, some households spend up to 90% of income.\nCNT also rates cities and neighborhoods on a scale of 1-10 with regard to factors such as job access, transit access and population density. El Paso ranks relatively low in all three of these areas:\nJob Access\n5.8 \/ 10 (Moderate access to\njobs)\nTransit Access\n1 \/10 (Car Dependent with very\nlimited or no access to public\ntransportation)\nNeighborhood Density\n3.7\/10 (Low Density and Limited walkability)\ngreater than 45%\nless than 45%\nHUMAN HEALTH + PREVENTABLE DISEASE\nThe City of El Paso Department of Health identified obesity, diabetes, fitness and nutrition as the number one health priority for our community in 2013. In addition, of patients admitted to El Paso Children's Hospital, bronchitis and asthma without complications has been identified as the number one general pediatric diagnosis. These statistics are\nindicative of a population suffering from a high level of preventable disease directly affected by the surrounding physical environment. According to the National Equity Atlas, 69% of adults in the El Paso Metro Area were classified as overweight and obese in 2012. The statistic remains relatively consistent across ethnic groups as well as throughout a variety of neighborhoods within the City of El Paso. According to Plan El\nPaso, adopted in 2012, \u201cThose who live in completely unwalkable sprawl often have to drive for all of life's daily necessities, including commuting to school and work, purchasing food, attending services at places of worship, visiting friends and relatives, and even visiting health and fitness centers. This, combined with industrialized food distribution networks that facilitate the consumption of unhealthy foods while creating impediments to a healthy diet, can partially explain the rise in obesity and many related conditions.\u201d\nFOOD ACCESS\nFood access is a complex issue whose challenges for El Paso lie in a variety of areas. Topics such as access to the right kind of food, cultural capacity to embrace healthy food preparation and obfuscated food distribution systems present barriers to a healthy El Paso. Combined with other environmental challenges, food and nutrition become part of a larger picture of critical health concerns facing residents. Food Deserts, areas with little or no access to a variety of nutritious and affordable food, exist across El Paso and while access is a core issue, it can't be addressed in isolation. According the HEAL (Healthy Eating Active Living) Strategic plan done by the Paso Del Norte Health foundation, \u201c\u201cone recent pilot study of the impacts of opening a new grocery store in a food desert showed no change in fruit and vegetable intake or BMI, highlighting the need for comprehensive approaches that target not just availability but also additional strategies to increase purchases and consumption of healthy foods, while keeping in mind the economic impact on low income residents in targeted areas.\u201d\nExtremely high temperatures in El Paso are extremely likely to occur and can have severe consequences specifically among the most vulnerable in our population. Extreme heat is a reality across the desert southwest, with temperatures in El Paso often reaching between 105 and 110 degrees F in the mid summer months. Impoverished and elderly communities are the most at risk. Increased usage of refrigerated air mitigates comfort issues for some people, but increases the strain on the local electrical grid and fails to address the concerns of those unable to afford it. Emergency response capacity is relatively high as is neighborhood community support. However, increased volunteerism and citizen training programs are sporadic and limited in capacity.\nEl Paso has seen an increase in the average number of triple degree days over the last hundred years. In the summer of 2016, the community experienced 38 straight days of\nAVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS PER YEAR WITH TRIPLE DIGIT TEMPERATURE\nThe graph at left\nindicates the\naverage rise in\nnumber of triple\ndigit temperatures per year since 1916. Severe spikes have been noted over the last 25-30 years.\ntriple degree heat as compared with the average 15. This period of heat placed created an extended period of peak energy demand placing extraordinary strain on local infrastructure. The local utility was able to manage the demand, but the event was a reminder of the need to address energy usage and community safety during these events. Four deaths were also recorded as a result of the extreme heat.\nDROUGHT\nDrought is a frequently occurring condition in the desert southwest, with high likelihood, medium impact and high capacity for response. Among the agricultural community, the drought risk factor is high in that access to water for irrigation is critical to business and family livelihood. However, water scarcity and continued drought is also of great concern to every El Pasoan. The City of El Paso and the surrounding region is dependent on both ground and surface sources for water supply. Surface water supplied by the Rio Grande River is dependent on upstream sources in New Mexico and Colorado. The El Paso Water Utilities recently declared the current situation of drought to be a key concern, \u201cWe usually depend on the river for 50 percent of our water supply. But because the river is dry, we are not going to be able to do that this year.\u201d Aside from surface water, El Paso's groundwater is supplied via the Hueco and Mesilla Bolsons. Current supply for El Paso is about 9% surface water, 24% from the Mesilla Bolson and 67% from the Hueco Bolson. El Paso Water has pursued efforts to reduce pumping in the Hueco Bolson however it did increase in 2003, 2004, 2011, 2012, 2013 in direct response to drought conditions resulting from reduced river allocation. Varying river allocations and continued drought conditions force groundwater levels and recharge to remain a critical concern for the region.\nConstant efforts to advance technology in an effort to leverage new sources and extend the capacity of existing systems are being pursued by the El Paso Water Utilities. The utility operates the largest inland desalination plant in the world producing up to 27.5 million gallons of water daily. The desalination plant makes a previously unusable brackish water supply a key source for the future of water in our region. Additionally, the utility has begun to explore Advanced Water Treatment processes that treat wastewater to potable levels delivered directly to the population. This project, currently in a pilot phase, is expected to begin to serve regional residents by 2019.\nFLASH FLOODING\nFlash Flooding is a reality in a desert environment. However, El Paso has experienced an increase in frequency and severity of storms resulting in significant flooding in recent years. Specifically, El Pasoans recall the impact resulting from the flooding and storms of 2006. El Paso receives only approximately 8 inches of total rainfall a year with flooding occurring often under relatively light rainfall conditions (ranging from 2-4 inches at a time). However, even 2-4 inches, when focused in a small geographic area with inadequate manmade infrastructure combined with a degraded naturally occurring arroyo system and steep slopes can have severe impacts on citizens and property.\nStormwater conveyance in the City of El Paso has traditionally relied on surface street infrastructure to move water during a storm event. Following the storms and subsequent damage occurring in 2006, City Council established a stormwater utility managed from within the El Paso Water Utility and funded by monthly user fees. A stormwater masterplan was established to guide capital investment in this infrastructure. According to the El Paso Water Utility, \u201cNatural arroyos provide a stormwater runoff conveyance with built in energy dissipation and debris removal features. Some arroyos are protected from development and remain as natural channels. Natural depressions can also be used to retain stormwater runoff. These areas can be integrated into the stormwater system while being preserved as wilderness areas.\u201d 10% of the established stormwater fee is directed toward the preservation of open space and greenways that are supportive of channeling or retaining stormwater runoff. Plan El Paso, 2012, recommended production of a comprehensive map illustrating critical arroyos and related ecologically sensitive lands as a part of ongoing planning efforts. This extended mapping study will be required to have deep integration of natural and man made system within a comprehensive regional stormwater management system.\nFRANKLIN MOUNTAIN ARROYO\nNETWORK \u2022 285 arroyos \u2022 8,910 acres of arroyos \u2022 41.5% of arroyos are on City-\nowned lands\n\u2022 12.1% of arroyos are on federally-owned lands\n\u2022 3.0% of arroyos are on State-owned lands\n\u2022 43.4% of arroyos are on privately-owned lands\nSource: Arroyos and Open Space: Enhancing Quality of Life for our Neighborhoods\nBUILDING THE WORKFORCE\nEl Paso is home to a youthful population. The largest population group by age is 19 years old and under (33% of residents), while a smaller 21% is aged 20 to 34. This data supports ongoing challenge of regional \u201cbrain drain\u201d indicative of the exodus of young educated professionals from the area. Between 1995 and 2000, El Paso had a net migration of 18,565 adults with a high school education or above, including 11,203 with some college education and 2,990 with a Bachelor's degree. This is particularly the case for those with a background in engineering and computer sciences. As of 2010, 85% of UTEP engineering graduates were leaving the region due primarily to low wages.\nPOPULATION WITH LESS THAN 9TH\tPOPULATION WITH BACHELOR'S\nGRADE EDUCATION\tDEGREE\nRetaining and attracting talent is a constant challenge. El Paso has historically suffered from a variety of cultural and economic barriers to post secondary education and in turn workforce opportunity. Our predominantly Hispanic community, struggles to overcome challenges associated with an undereducated population with a low graduation rate and some of the lowest wages in the country. Local efforts to address workforce and postsecondary education are therefore by necessity aimed at elevating opportunity for those that are most vulnerable in our border community. An additional barrier is the lack of consistent connection between industry and education in terms of workforce needs and progressive industry creation. There is a great need to set common regional goals and\nbenchmarks for progress and opportunities for improvement.\n44\nCHALLENGES OF A BORDER METROPLEX\nEl Paso is one half of the largest Bi-National Metroplex in the Western Hemisphere. We are home to $54 billion in annual bi-national imports and exports. Additionally, $64.7 billion in goods are transported through El Paso every year. Advanced manufacturing and logistics is a regional strength with great opportunity for innovation and expansion. However, opportunities for industrial diversification have the potential to be expanded based on the variety of assets present in the region. To date El Paso has suffered from a lack of such diversification that leverages innovation and entrepreneurship in emerging industry sectors.\nThere are variety of other challenges\npresented within a border community. For\nexample, the presence of a large bi-national,\nbi-lingual population can be a significant\nasset. However, many bilingual residents\ndo not have professional-level fluency in\neither language which can present a barrier\nto development. Communities along the\nborder also face a number of environmental\nchallenges ranging from air quality, scarce\nshared water sources and degradation of\nnatural resources and ecosystems. a systems\nchallenge the region regardless of the location\nof the designated international border.\nThe purpose of pursuing resilience is not simply to brace El Paso for the next emergency, but to leverage our challenges as opportunities, reinforcing our ability to move beyond survival toward a thriving future.\nWhile the challenges presented here are many, within each there is also great opportunity for our community to thrive. Social vulnerability in El Paso is largely based in issues of socioeconomic mobility and access\nto opportunity. These challenges to resilience in our community are predominantly defined by issues of poverty, energy security, human health, urban mobility and food security. It's often the poorest among us that are classified as the most vulnerable. However, neighborhoods with the highest level of poverty can exemplify the highest levels of resilience. The ability to survive a variety of shocks and stresses has emerged as a cultural trait within these communities. Social cohesion in El Paso is reinforced by extended family units and strong neighborhood ties. The vulnerability lies in the barriers to prosperity beyond survival. Families often lack the capacity to generate and retain wealth, limiting opportunity for current and future generations to thrive, breaking the cycle of poverty. Low wages, educational opportunity, access to healthy lifestyle choices and limited mobility are all exemplary of the barriers facing this population.\nEl Paso has an opportunity to enhance quality of life and promote prosperity across the community by addressing each of those challenges through a cross cutting lens, inclusive of economic, social and environmental concerns. For example, by leveraging a regional history rooted in native American lifestyles that traditionally embraced desert food systems and natural preparation practices presents opportunities to improve human health and reinforce multi cultural understanding. Recent community interest in urban agriculture provides a platform to affect community cohesion around healthy food. Additionally, by addressing regional food systems El Paso has the opportunity to impact other areas of vulnerability\nincluding waste and water management, energy generation, heat island effect, innovation and entrepreneurship.\nAnother opportunity is presented in the vast number of plans supported by the city over the past 10 years. For example, there has been an enormous amount of study, planning and investment put toward an effort to revitalize El Paso's downtown. A key example of that effort, is the 2015 Downtown Plan. In 2005 City Council approved funding to proceed with the plan. The goals of that plan were to:\n\u2022 Create a Dynamic, Mixed-use Downtown Inviting all El Pasoans\n\u2022 Introduce New Investments that are Catalysts for all Downtown\n\u2022 Create Opportunities for Private Investment \u2022 Enhance the City's Cultural and Historic Heritage \u2022 Develop High Quality Housing for Area Residents \u2022 Create Jobs for El Pasoans\n\u2022 Increase the City's Tax Base.\nEach of those goals correlates with the resilience challenges presented here. However, progress to date toward those goals has been inconsistent. There is incredible opportunity to address specific resource issues such as energy and water demand by investing in upgrades to the urban core as suggested in the plan, while creating sustainable revitalization for downtown.\nEl Paso has a rich history full of success but also wrought with intense challenges. Resilience is about recognizing the strength and value that stems from both of those things. We can't forget where we've come from; we have to learn to live, love and act in the moment; but possibly most important, it is up to us to own our own future . What is ahead of us is yet to be written. How that story plays out for El Paso is in the hands, heads and hearts of El Pasoans.\niADELANTE!\nThe resilience strategy is a roadmap toward building strength, adaptability and prosperity into our community now and well into the future. The roadmap contains four Pillars that establish a foundation for the work to come, 13 specific goals clarifying the direction of the work and 36 definitive actions that identify activities, partners and timelines.\nNo one pillar, goal or action can achieve success in isolation. Much of the work in El Paso done to date has occurred in an ad hoc manner; one effort disconnected, siloed, from the others. This strategy is intended to inextricably link how we build the environment surrounding us, how we interact with each other and also to challenge government to lead our community toward a long term strategic vision of resilience.\nEl Paso is in a position to provide global leadership for other cities facing the challenges of the 21st century; ranging from the evolution of city infrastructure to developing robust public private partnerships supportive of a resilient global economy to how to engage a diverse range of stakeholders .\nThese tenets will define the work ahead for El Paso and shape the future of the region.\nTHE VIBRANT DESERT CITY\nThe effect that city systems and infrastructure can have on a community is significant. The built environment is simultaneously a reflection of who we are and have been as a people as well as being the vehicle that moves us into the future. El Paso will leverage its unique rich heritage, cultural identity and desert assets to transform behavior, advance city systems and enhance infrastructure to build a city capable of sustaining a high quality of life standard.\nTHE THRIVING BINATIONAL ECONOMY\nEl Paso is one half of a thriving binational metroplex that for centuries has served as a hub for commerce, development and international relations. It is also part of a region that represents one of the largest manufacturing centers in North America. As a globally recognized commerce hub, El Paso has an opportunity to drive the direction of economic growth and expansion in the region by defining its identity as an environmentally aware, creatively diverse, binational community.\nEMPOWERED EL PASOANS\nAgency, in sociological terms, means, \u201c the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices.\u201d Resilient El Paso has to begin with activating the agency of El Pasoans. The strength of our culture, the richness of our roots and the depths of our potential can only emerge through an empowered populace; change that begins from the grass roots up. El Pasoans building their own vision of a resilient future for our city.\nRESILIENT GOVERNANCE\nBuilding resilience into decision making for government should begin with activation of consistent, open and collaborative partnerships. Partnerships between public agencies, but also collaboration with community groups, the private sector and non profit partners. For El Paso, that means collaborating across the borders of 3 states and 2 countries. A resilient El Paso depends on a collaborative, reflective and globally connected city government.\nEl Paso is a city made up of a series of complex physical systems that serve a diverse, international population. It is the hub from which these systems have supported daily life across the region for centuries. Critical components of city systems include housing, public facilities, commercial development and the infrastructure that connects them all together. Each has significant impacts on the health, wellbeing and prosperity of our community and our environment. Equal to the need to be careful stewards of our city for future generations is our responsibility to recognize the importance of our heritage and the commitment to the growth and prosperity of our community by the generations of El Pasoans who have come before us.

By establishing a clear and comprehensive vision for housing, the strategy lays the framework for long-term funding and development opportunities supportive of the diverse needs of all El Pasoans as well as those considering El Paso as a permanent home.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: HACEP, Home Builders Association, Private Sector Developers\nACTION 1.1.2 Develop and deploy resources, plans, partnerships and system capacity aimed at reaching functional zero homelessness for the El Paso community.\nSimultaneous to the assembly of the Comprehensive Housing Strategy, the City of El Paso will convene a facilitated exchange among community partners committed to achieving functional zero homelessness within targeted populations across the region. Output from the exchange will include alignment of policy and funding resources toward programs that serve as a mechanism to 1) identify those experiencing homelessness 2) provide access to shelter for those in need 3) enhance crisis response services providing improved health and safety and 4) increase capacity for permanent housing and ongoing case management. Critical to the success of the initiative will be to conduct an analysis of gaps and barriers in terms of existing programs, policy and funding sources.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: El Paso Coalition for the Homeless, Veterans Advisory Council, The Opportunity Center for the Homeless, Project VIDA, Centro San Vicente, UTEP\nIn early 2016, the Mayor convened an official Blue Ribbon Committee to review internal city process with regard to evaluation of local projects seeking municipal support of low income housing tax credit applications. The committee spent approximately 9 weeks evaluating key factors impacting affordable housing quality and supply in the El Paso community. The following is a summary of those findings:\nEl Paso neighborhoods vary in scale and type, ranging from:\n\u2022\temerging downtown residential population\n\u2022\tmore sprawling middle - high income suburban neighborhoods\n\u2022\tlarge-scale public housing communities concentrated in developed areas\n\u2022\tnew affordable housing in suburban neighborhoods\n\u2022\tinformal extremely low income colonias at the edges of the city\nmost neighborhoods lack amenities and infrastructure to:\n\u2022\tsupport resident well-being\n\u2022\tintegrate communities\n\u2022\tbuild overall resilience at a city scale\n\u2022\ta need to enhance neighborhood healthiness and livability across the various communities of El Paso.\nIDENTIFIED CRITICAL RESILIENCE FACTORS\nBASIC\nBEYOND BASIC\n\u2022\taffordable energy\n\u2022\tclean water\n\u2022\ttransportation options\n\u2022\taccess to jobs + education\n\u2022\thealth care & preventive health\n\u2022\thealthy food choices\n\u2022\topen space access \/ opportunity for\nactive living\n\u2022 community connectivity \/\nservices\n\u2022 clean + safe environmental\nempowerment\n\u2022\teconomic opportunities\n\u2022\tculturally relevant multi-generational\nconditions \u2022 safe places\nconnectivity\nThe Frontera Land Alliance, a non-profit organization,\nbegan in 2005 when a group of community members\nrealized there was an urgent need to help preserve\nsome of the important remaining natural and working\nlands in the greater El Paso and southern New\nMexico region. The organization has developed the\nknowledge and expertise to provide guidance to land\nowners wanting to maintain the character of their\nland.\nThe Frontera Land Alliance has achieved a number of\nimportant successes in land conservation as well as\ncommunity outreach. The ninety-one acre Wakeem\/\nTeschner Nature Preserve at Resler arroyo was\nacquired in 2006. It serves as an oasis for wildlife\nwithin El Paso and an important refuge in which\ncommunity members can unwind and re-engage with\nnature. It also acts as an important wildlife corridor\nand conduit for water to another nature preserve\ndownstream, the Keystone Heritage Park.\nThunder Canyon is a 24 acre arroyo set aside through an exciting partnership between local residents, the City of El Paso and Frontera. The people living around the arroyo worked with the City and Frontera to forge an agreement through which the City purchased the land from the developer and the residents agreed to repay the City for the initial costs. Frontera holds the conservation easement that insures the land will never be developed.\nFrontera is committed to educating the public about land conservation. In this capacity, the organization has set up workshops for landowners, government officials and the general public to help them learn about the various methods that can be applied to conserve lands and the benefits to be derived from that process.\nGOAL 1.2\nInstitutionalize responsible stewardship of city assets\nthrough sustainable design and land development\npractices for all city owned and operated property.\nACTION 1.2.1 Create a framework for sustainable development of local green field sites supportive of social, environmental and economic benefits.\nBuilding upon work established by the Public Service Board Preservation \/ Conservation Committee, the City of El Paso will coordinate an interdepartmental effort to establish an open space development toolkit including a standard evaluation framework, typology guidance tools alongside appropriate policy and incentives that maximize economic, social and environmental benefits. Additionally, the City of El Paso will prioritize preservation of land identified as an environmental asset in alignment with the proposed Ecosystem Services Assessment. Areas currently identified by city leadership include Rio Bosque, Red Sands, Castner Range, the Franklin Mountains and land surrounding the proposed regional trail system.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 3 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Frontera Land Alliance, County of El Paso, Open Space Advisory Board\nACTION 1.2.2 Increase return on investment while maximizing social and environmental benefits for public projects by embedding sustainable building practices within City of El Paso project design and construction processes as well as improvement of existing facilities.\nDepartments within the Public Works Portfolio of the City of El Paso, in collaboration with regional experts and local professionals, will develop specific procedures and best practices supportive of increased building efficiency and community benefit including energy, water, open space and connectivity. Emphasis will be placed on establishment of performance based standards and companion metrics for all newly built city properties. For existing facilities, the effort will focus on performance improvements through smart technology implementation as well as departmental behavioral adaptation.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 7 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: USGBC, AIA, Eco-Districts\nGOAL 1.3\nEstablish a support mechanism for resilient development practices for private sector projects across El Paso.\nRESILIENCE VALUE: By expanding institutional support for prioritized resilient development practices, the City will encourage sustainable long term planning while enhancing capacity for responsible growth for the private sector.\nACTION 1.3.1 Create a portfolio of alternative funding sources with the potential to fill funding gaps in private sector projects supportive of identified city resilience goals.\nThe City of El Paso is currently working with multiple partners to identify federal, state and private funding sources focused on addressing identified resilience challenges such as stormwater management, energy\/water efficiency, mobility and historic \/ cultural preservation. When paired together, these sources have the potential to fill multiple funding gaps for private development. For example, energy efficiency grants paired with historic preservation incentives make possible an effective formula for retrofit projects in El Paso's urban core.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Texas PACE Authority, County of El Paso, BECC, El Paso Water, EPE, DMD,\nHistoric Landmark Commission, TPWD\nACTION 1.3.2 Embed critical resilience criteria into existing and planned economic dvelopment incentives.\nThe Economic and International Development Department will create a rubric for measuring resilience value when considering the deployment of existing economic development incentives. The new criteria will become a required standard measure for evaluating and prioritizing how incentives should be strategically awarded, with potential measures such as: number of skilled jobs, how the business addresses a resilience need in the community, its goals for ongoing community engagement, and its use of sustainable infrastructure.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: ULI, Greater Chamber of Commerce, Borderplex Alliance\nIn addition to pursuing exemplary\nbuilding performance and reduced\nenvironmental impact for public\nfacilities, the City of El Paso has\nestablished a track record of\nsupporting projects that significantly\ncontribute to the sustainability and\nvitality of our community. The Cardwell\nCollaborative, a 60,000 square foot,\n$28 million biomedical research and\ntechnology commercialization building\ndeveloped by MCA Tech Park, Inc., is\none such project. The building, named\nafter local businessman and philanthropist, Mr. Jack Cardwell, now stands as an icon, symbolizing the region's proliferating biomedical community and serves as a reminder of the achievements that can be attained through public-private collaboration.\nThe three-story LEED Silver building features 20,000 square feet of biomedical incubator space (wet-labs, dry-labs, lab support, private offices, open offices and collaboration spaces) in a building that brings private start-up companies and university personnel together under one roof to collaborate. TTUHSC El Paso occupies 20,000 square feet of space with a variety of office-based research and support departments. The other 20,000 square feet are occupied by the MCA Foundation, a branch of the City of El Paso's Economic Development Department and other non-profit companies that support the incubation mission.\nThe Cardwell Collaborative sits at the entrance of the \u201cResearch Park\u201d section of the 440-acre master planned MCA Campus. The academic medical campus is organized into the following sections: education, healthcare delivery, research and support. Campus partners include Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso, University Medical Center of El Paso, El Paso Children's Hospital, City Public Health, State Psychiatric IP Hospital, West Texas Poison Control Center, Coroner's Office, Silva Health Professions Magnet High School, and MCA. Working together with the City of El Paso, these partners will transform the once blighted neighborhood into a center for healthcare excellence and biomedical innovation. The City of El Paso has provided leadership in the development of this Campus and economic center through funding and other partnerships with the MCA Foundation and other Campus stakeholders.\nDowntown El Paso offers centuries of historical, cultural and bi-national potential. In recent years, downtown has seen a tremendous amount of activity, both public and private. Although very significant, that activity has been and continues to be somewhat ad hoc.\nIn terms of major public investments, the implementation of the Quality of Life Bond Program seeks to build on the success of the Southwest University Park Stadium and the execution of the El Paso Streetcar through two new museums and a new arena. In addition, various parking strategies have been implemented in addition to a recent initiative to focus on historic El Paso Street as an spine for a broader wayfinding and streetscaping strategy.\nRegarding private development, numerous hotels have or are soon to open, along with numerous restaurants. In terms of residential, Artspace Lofts and a handful of other urban multifamily projects have been constructed. Hunt plans a major downtown office building, portending potentially other office opportunities.\nWhether focused on heritage tourism from the distant past, or historic preservation celebrating the more recent architecture of Henry Trost and the original streetcar flowing from the town's planning ethos during the City Beautiful Movement, El Paso has begun to re-embrace its authentic historical foundation and its relationship to Ciudad Juarez.\nThis amazing unfolding story presents an incredible future for downtown. That momentum, nevertheless, faces two fundamental risks.\n\u2022 One is that emerging synergy among the myriad of initiatives and activities is squandered because of their ad hoc nature.\n\u2022 Second, the emerging gravity of economic development north of Paisano Drive is not connected with and resonant with the historic border retail economy south of Paisano.\nACTION 1.3.3 Expand support for enhancement of El Paso's cultural and historic building assets through inclusive planning, outreach and comprehensive research and analysis of targeted development sites.\nThe Paso Del Norte region is rich with both cultural and architectural history. While much of this history has endured years of growth in the area, renewed attention must be paid to the value of what remains in terms of heritage tourism as well as economic development potential in terms of adaptive reuse and revitalization of key areas including the Mission Trail, historic Ft. Bliss and the downtowns of both El Paso and Ciudad Juarez.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Downtown Management District, Texas Trost Society, County of El Paso,\nBorderplex Alliance, Historic Landmark Commission, Urban Land Institute, Ciudad Juarez\nGOAL 1.4\nDesign and implement infrastructure projects that maximize co-benefits, simultaneously addressing climatic and social stressors such as flooding, heat, energy and citizen mobility.\nACTION 1.4.1 Address identified environmental challenges by deploying best practices and identifying key performance-based metrics to assess infrastructure resilience.\nAs an arid urban environment, El Paso experiences a variety of stresses ranging from limited regional water resources to water management in the face of flash flooding to intense heat for extended periods of time all triggering both infrastructure and human health challenges. Best practices for reducing runoff volume, improving water quality, minimizing heat island effect and maximizing energy efficiency will be prioritized as infrastructure development projects are implemented. A keen focus will be placed on how to effectively deploy green infrastructure with capacity to address not only water management, but also improve air quality, enhance walkability, and beautify public spaces.\nThe City of El Paso will convene public and private sector stakeholders to design and implement sustainable programs and practices on a citywide basis. The municipality will institutionalize these best practices in the form of ongoing performance measurement and verification. However, in order to overcome these challenges, the city will need to work with external partners to holistically combat the impacts of environmental stresses now and into the future.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 7 Strategic Planning Team PARTNERS: BECC, El Paso Water, UTEP\nACTION 1.4.2 Mobilize an interagency working group to develop regional development performance metrics in the context of large scale community wide infrastructure projects.\nThe City of El Paso will co-chair alongside the Metropolitan Planning Organization task force made up of a diverse group of regional of stakeholders currently convened as the the Borderplex 2020 Regional Planning Task Force. The group has over the past two\nyears worked to identify the existing framework of plans and development initiatives from Southern New Mexico through West Texas and into Northern Chihuahua. The next goal for the group will be to leverage that information with identified regional priorities to create a dynamic performance matrix that can be utilized to maximize impact of major regional infrastructure projects.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 7 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Borderplex Alliance Regional Planning Task Force\nACTION 1.4.3 Demonstrate multiple benefits of resilient development practices at a targeted urban infill multi-use redevelopment site.\nWhile there are common themes among resilient development projects, the nature of each project type presents unique challenges and opportunities to establish best practices. The City of El Paso is currently planning for a demonstration of resilient development at a targeted urban infill site formerly utilized as a large scale sports venue. The site, known as Cohen Stadium is nestled just on the eastern side of the Franklin Mountains between a major community college campus and a quickly revitalizing residential neighborhood. The revitalization and repurposing of Cohen Stadium will serve as a catalyst for future development in northeast El Paso. By planning a master community, the City can assist in bringing new opportunities, low-income housing and other necessary amenities to the region.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 7 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: El Paso Community College, Area Neighborhood Associations, Borderplex Alliance regional Planning Task Force\nThe social fabric of this portion of El Paso's urban core remains vibrant, inspiring and strong despite sobering demographics that illustrate many challenges. A high level of cultural pride is associated with residents and is evidenced in the variety of community events attended throughout the year and made manifest in the many murals that can be found across the territory. A specific example of this cultural strength can be experienced at and around Lincoln Park and Lincoln Center toward the northern portion of this area. To the south, Bowie High School represents a robust heritage continues to be a source of strength for the neighborhood. There is much work to be done across the urban core of El Paso with an extraordinary opportunity presented in this zone.\nCHAMIZAL DEVELOPMENT STATEMENT\nTo preserve and enhance cultural and historical assets which exist in the community while enhancing and investing in mobility, education, healthcare, green space and infrastructure.\nGUIDING PROJECT PRINCIPLES\n\u2022 This physical project has impact across social, economic, and\/or environmental realms.\n\u2022 This project, while specific to Chamizal, represents challenges endemic to other areas of El Paso, and can potentially be replicated and scaled to other communities.\n\u2022 This project is innovative in its approach to cross collaborative planning and decision making.\n\u2022 This project positively affects human health outcomes.\n\u2022 This project builds Chamizal's resilience to impacts of acute shocks or chronic stresses.\nACTION 1.4.4 Demonstrate and measure the multiple benefits of resilient development practices focused on active transportation and connectivity along a primary redevelopment corridor.\nUtilizing the performance metrics established by the interagency regional planning group, the City of El Paso will deploy best practices for active transportation development in targeted redevelopment corridors. The International Beltway portion of the Metropolitan Planning Organization's (MPO) Alternative Transportation System provides an opportunity to demonstrate and measure success prior to full citywide application. The International Beltway project covers and area spanning from the Medical Center of the Americas, past the Chamizal National Memorial, through the Chamizal Neighborhood and Segundo Barrio, connecting to El Paso's downtown government and commercial districts and culminating in the historic Chihuahua neighborhood immediately north of the Paso del Norte International Port of Entry. In 2017, in partnership with the Urban Land Institute, the City of El Paso convened a Resilience Advisory Panel including subject matter experts from around the country. The results of that advisory panel are intended to both guide the manifestation of the International Beltway and serve as an example of best practices to be implemented citywide.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 7 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Borderplex Alliance Regional Planning Task Force\nEl Paso is the largest metro area along the Texas-Mexico border boasting a best-inclass, business friendly operating environment as well as an authentic, deeply rich culture and unique urban desert experience.

El Paso is focused on optimizing the use of environmental assets in the face of global climate change, activating the creative capacity of the largest bilingual, bicultural workforce in the western hemisphere and leveraging our geography as an international hub for commerce and trade toward the goal of pursuing growth opportunities for 21st century industries. To guide that growth, a core set of values can be utilized to triangulate opportunity for the bi-national metroplex. Those values are defined by the promise of a clean technology future, an emphasis on the creativity and innovation capacity of local culture and a clear definition of El Paso's robust international identity.\n1.\tDevelop support vehicles for innovative industry development supportive of established core values.\n\u2022 Collaborate with regional partners, leveraging existing strategic planning, to develop tools that align priority industry clusters with identified core resilience values for economic development.\n\u2022 Deploy a plan to create demonstration hubs across El Paso complimentary of an innovation technology park focused on clean technology industries with an emphasis on energy and water demand challenges.\n\u2022 Develop a comprehensive Urban Energy Plan focused on reducing energy demand, easing policy barriers to renewable technology and limiting challenges to investment in clean energy infrastructure.\n\u2022 Incorporate critical social and environmental resilience factors as key components of regional economic development initiatives.\n2.\tDefine workforce needs, activate key networks and develop support vehicles in support of small business development, leveraging El Paso's innovation ecosystem, community resources and local talent.\n\u2022 Deploy a public-private partnership to establish an innovation center and co-work space in support of small business development and local entrepreneurialism.\n\u2022 Collaborate with regional partners to commission a study that will identify the needs of the local business community as well as workforce and educational institutions, which will be used to create and sustain a robust business retention and expansion program.\n\u2022 Identify resources and training to close existing skills gaps preparing the regional workforce for emerging industry clusters.\n3.\tCatalyze the nature of the binational metroplex, leveraging El Paso's creative culture, authentic heritage and unique urban desert identity toward the attraction of visitors, residents and businesses.\n\u2022 Develop a specific plan to lay the foundation for El Paso as an eco-tourist destination, driven by preservation of key local natural assets.\n\u2022 Leverage the historic nature and physical assets of the Paso Del Norte region to develop a heritage tourism plan focused on elevating El Paso as an international destination.\n\u2022 Elevate El Paso's creative economy by developing support vehicles for local culture, art and film industries.\nGOAL 2.1\nDevelop support vehicles for innovative industry development supportive of established core values.\nACTION 2.1.1 Collaborate with regional partners, leveraging existing strategic planning, to develop tools that align priority industry clusters with identified core resilience values for economic development.\nAs part of an extensive collaborative effort led by the Borderplex Alliance, The City of El Paso has worked across both public and private sectors, bringing together leaders from across the region in an effort to identify specific goals and break through the variety of challenges unique to the North American Borderplex. Specific emphasis has been placed on understanding current regional conditions in the areas of Education & Workforce as well as Planning & Development as they relate to strengthening 5 strategically identified industry clusters. These industry clusters include Defense & Aerospace, Advanced Manufacturing, Advanced Logistics, Business Services, Life Sciences, Tourism, and Entrepreneurship. The City of El Paso has placed leaders from across the municipal organization within each of the Borderplex Task Teams as well as the Borderplex 2020 Strategic Planning Steering Committee. Utilizing these partnerships as a vehicle, The City of El Paso can establish tools, aligned with core resilience values, through which to optimize business investment in the region, identify other potential target industries and build avenues for trade and business expansion. Corresponding metrics will outline community impact benchmarks that have capacity to determine how industry can contribute to El Paso's positive growth and minimize negative environmental and social impacts in the region.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Borderplex Alliance, Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness, Borderplex 2020 Strategic Planning Partners\nThe vision for El Paso as a model\nresilient city requires us to address\nthe environmental challenges\nof the 21st century through\ncollaborative partnerships,\ninnovative technologies and\nintegrated systems thinking. As\nthe regional population expands\nand temperatures continue\nto soar, energy becomes a\ncentral component to continued\ncommunity prosperity. Energy\nefficiency and renewable energy\ndevelopment are the focal points\nof that effort.\nIn August of 2016, the City of El Paso, alongside the Hub of Human Innovation, the Borderplex Alliance, El Paso Electric and the Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness convened an Urban Energy Forum targeted at identifying key challenges and opportunities to energy industry development in the Paso Del Norte Region. Stakeholders from across the region of diverse backgrounds came together in a unique design lab format and were challenged to collaborate over the duration of the 4 hour workshop.\nKEY COLLABORATIVE OUTCOMES\nDuring the forum, several cross cutting themes were identified as potential barriers to energy industry development in the region:\n\u2022 Infrastructure development and reliability in a next generation environment including adaptive resource planning\n\u2022 Connectivity, collection and access to relatable data across municipal and regional networks\n\u2022 Application of regional data for decision making in terms of infrastructure investment, regulation and local policy\nThe ability to leverage new technologies such as the Internet of Things IoT, Big Data Collection and Smart City technologies could provide the path toward a renewable and resilient future for our community.\nACTION 2.1.2 Deploy a plan to create demonstration hubs across El Paso complimentary of an innovation technology park focused on clean technology industries with an emphasis on energy and water demand challenges.\nAs the regional population expands, rising energy costs and limited water resources become increasingly central components to continued community prosperity as well as to business retention, attraction and expansion. The vision for El Paso as a model resilient city requires us to address the environmental challenges of the 21st century through collaborative partnerships, innovative technologies and integrated systems thinking. Research and development of innovative energy and water technologies are focal points of that effort. By developing sites across El Paso as technology demonstration spaces the City can take an alternative approach to attracting leading companies from around the world and promoting sustainable economic growth. The City will engage multiple public and private partners to align the efforts of research, development and land availability in the context of resilient infrastructure needs. Key to the success of the initiative will be to leverage El Paso's community entrepreneurs to enhance capacity for commercialization of developed technologies.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Local Utilities, UTEP, Workforce Solutions Borderplex, Hub of Human Innovation, Ft.

The plan will focus on creating a City of El Paso Combined Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Standard. This work will set goals across a variety of issues related to energy generation and management across El Paso including Capacity for Renewable Generation and Demand Reduction Standards as well as Cost Mitigation Measures and required Industry and Workforce Development.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: UTEP, El Paso Electric, Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness, State and\nFederal Legislators\nACTION 2.1.4 Incorporate critical social and environmental resilience factors as key components of regional economic development initiatives.\nIn just under the last 10 years, The City of El Paso has executed 126 economic development\nincentive agreements (2009 - present). Over that time, nearly $1.5 billion in new capital investment has occurred in addition to over 7,000 jobs being added in just the last year. Currently, bonus incentives are available for businesses that locate in specific areas of the urban core or establish a headquarters in El Paso. Additional bonuses are available if a business shows support for local education and workforce initiatives such as partnering with local educational entities, providing mentorship\/internship opportunities or workforce training. Offering higher wages and establishing hiring programs for target populations such as veterans are also encouraged. In recent years, The City of El Paso has promoted a Transit Oriented Development Incentive Policy to link higher density, walkable neighborhoods to transit station and corridors. The City of El Paso has solidly linked quality of life priorities to economic development incentives. The next step is to evaluate how best to incorporate critical environmental and social resilience factors ranging from energy demand and water management to community benefit and corporate philanthropy. As part of the Citywide Strategic Plan, Economic Development Incentives are evaluated every 5 years.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: UTEP, Hunt Institute for Global Competitiveness, Borderplex Alliance\nGOAL 2.2\nDefine workforce needs, activate key networks and develop support vehicles in support of small business development, leveraging El Paso's innovation ecosystem, community resources and local talent.\nACTION 2.2.1 Deploy a public-private partnership to establish an innovation center and co-work space in support of small business development and local entrepreneurialism.\nThe City of El Paso will leverage resources across the Economic and International Development, Community and Human Development and Public Library Departments to catalyze a partnership with the private sector to create the community's first public cowork space focused on enhancing equity and access to opportunity for small business. The physical pilot project will be located at the City of El Paso Main Library in the heart of downtown. In addition to working and conference space, the center will offer access to training and professional development resources. The goal is to create a network that through municipal support and private sector resources encourages cross-sector collaboration, enhances access to capital and promotes local talent. Should the pilot project show success, the City of El Paso would seek to expand the program to other public library locations across the city. Key metrics will focus not only on economic development and business success, but community benefit in terms of equal access to resources for vulnerable population not traditionally served by this type of venture in the private sector. This initiative is also transformative for the El Paso Public Library system. As the role of the library in the digital age continues to change, El Paso is moving to re-imagine that role for our community.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: El Paso Public Library, El Paso Dept of Community and Human Development, El Paso Dept of Economic Development, Co-Work Oasis, Workforce Solutions Borderplex\nACTION 2.2.2 Collaborate with regional partners to commission a study that will identify the needs of the local business community as well as workforce and educational institutions, which will be used to create and sustain a robust business retention and expansion program.\nAs the number of small, medium and large business grows, it is pertinent that the City of El Paso is equipped with the knowledge and insight needed to assist the business community and support organizations. By creating a foundation built on data and information, the City of El Paso can create a strategic program based on actual need rather than assumptions. Additionally, the results from the study will be shared with community partners in order to make existing programs more efficient and effective.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Greater El Paso Chamber of Commerce, Workforce Solutions Borderplex, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Borderplex Alliance\nACTION 2.2.3 Identify resources and training to close existing skills gaps preparing the regional workforce for emerging industry clusters.\nThe City of El Paso in collaboration with established partnership groups will identify knowledge and skills required to support emerging industry clusters. The City will work with local colleges, universities and professional development programs to encourage alignment between education and industry. Economic development partners will track learning objectives and participants' skill growth over time to ensure that initiatives are successfully closing skills gaps and an addressing the changing needs of the local economy. The initiative should also look to provide learning opportunities for K-12 students as they grow and move toward pursuing career goals. Through the collaborative partnership, the City of El Paso can encourage the development of research projects, internships and related mentoring opportunities for students. All private, academic, and workforce development partners will collaborate to align short-term learning opportunities with job placement and industry needs.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: El Paso Community College, Greater El Paso Chamber of Commerce, Workforce Solutions Borderplex, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Borderplex Alliance, Hub of Human Innovation, UTEP\nEl Paso's abundant natural capital is a critical part of the regional ecosystem and the economy. The shrublands surrounding the Franklin Mountains support rich biodiversity, capture water for the Hueco Bolson aquifer, and provide many other ecosystem benefits, from erosion control to moderation of flood events. El Paso's natural capital also provides direct benefits to local residents, including increased property values and improved health via recreation. All of these benefits are called ecosystem services, and they represent significant, long-term contributions to the local economy. This work by Earth Economics, is the first study to estimate the dollar value associated with these critical ecosystem services within El Paso.\nAcross the country, planners and policy makers are starting to include the value of natural capital assets (watersheds, forests, shrublands) and ecosystem services in their analyses. Though the techniques to identify, quantify, and monetize these economic contributions are still evolving, the values available today can immediately be used to gain a better understanding of the symbiotic relationship between a healthy environment, a resilient economy, and a thriving community. Including these values in planning and policy-making yields a more complete and accurate understanding of restoration and stewardship projects or policies and ultimately fosters more practical, cost-effective outcomes.\nThis analysis finds that the ecosystem services within the study area contribute $3.3 million to $6.5 million in ecosystem service benefits each year. El Paso's shrubland can also be viewed as a natural capital asset that provides a flow of benefits over time, similar to a building or a bridge. When measured like an asset with a lifespan of 100 years and a three percent discount rate, El Paso's natural capital has an asset value between $106 million and $209 million. With sufficient stewardship to maintain the health and function of El Paso's natural capital, this economic contribution will continue in perpetuity.

By analyzing the economic value of regional natural assets the city can develop preservation priorities and tourism opportunities as well as extended infrastructure resilience. This work builds upon an initial asset assessment conducted in summer of 2016.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: PSB, Frontera Land Alliance, Borderplex 2020 Regional Partners\nACTION 2.3.2 Leverage the historic nature and physical assets of the Paso Del Norte region to develop a heritage tourism plan focused on elevating El Paso as an international destination.\nBy establishing a clear and comprehensive vision for enhancing local heritage tourism, El Paso can become leaders in Texas on how to properly promote and sustain natural and historic assets. The City of El Paso will accomplish this task by leading an effort to develop a strategy that will preserve key historic and natural assets. These assets will be leveraged to transform El Paso into an international destination location that properly shares the community's vibrant culture. Additionally, the city will continue to show the importance of natural and historic preservation by promoting open space planning, minimizing the community's carbon footprint and by preserving key historic buildings throughout El Paso.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Historic Landmark Commission, County of El Paso, City of Soccoro, City of San Elizario, Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, City of Las Cruces, Ciudad Juarez, Destination El Paso\nACTION 2.3.3 Elevate El Paso's creative economy by developing support vehicles for local culture, art and film industries.\nEl Paso's economy has diversified and evolved over the last decade. With this change, it was imperative that the City of El Paso adapted to the new creative economy by identifying areas of opportunity. One such opportunity, was supporting local arts and culture initiatives. Developments such as the Roderick Artspace Lofts serve as an example of the commitment the City has to these cultural industries. By analyzing the role cultural arts has on the economy, City Economic Development can continue to incentivize cultural arts programs and developments aimed to further diversify and enrich the local economy.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Destination El Paso, City of El Paso Museums and Cultural Affairs Dept.\nThe goal of creating an empowered populace is to affect a high level of transparency and accountability as well as achieve meaningful change reflective of community need across El Paso. Service, volunteerism, and impact volunteering are the vehicles through which city government can build community trust, increase citizen understanding of government and ultimately engage El Pasoans in framing the city's path toward a resilient future. Leveraging public engagement via a shared leadership model will help the city identify & solve community challenges now and well into the future.\n1.\tActivate non-traditional tools to build productive dialog among community groups and public agencies.\n\u2022\tDeploy impact volunteering initiatives as part of the City of El Paso Service Plan to connect and mobilize non-profit organizations, corporations and City of El Paso departments in support of key citywide strategic priorities.\n\u2022\tActivate a City of El Paso Leadership Community Engagement Council.\n\u2022\tImplement Civic Design Labs in advance of major city initiatives including capital projects, policy initiatives and strategic planning updates.\n2.\tConnect people to citywide assets and programs that address community challenges, promote community vitality and improve quality of life.\n\u2022\tImplement ongoing community learning programs focused on healthy, sustainable living practices supportive of grass roots resilience building.\n\u2022\tImplement place-based solutions in key locations across El Paso neighborhoods to connect communities and city agencies.\n\u2022\tEstablish a supportive policy framework for a sustainable and reliable food system in support of improved community health and equal access for all El Pasoans.\n3.\tImprove conditions and enhance preparedness for low income residents by providing access to resources that address community resilience challenges.\n\u2022\tExpand and enhance access to El Paso's First Time Homebuyer Program.\n\u2022\tConnect residents with existing community development funding sources targeted at home repair and neighborhood improvement for low income population.\n\u2022\tCreate the City of El Paso Senior Corps program by consolidating resources and staff toward the enhancement of the Retired Senior Volunteer Program and the Foster Grandparent Program.\nGOAL 3.1\nActivate non-traditional tools to build productive dialog among community groups and public agencies.\nACTION 3.1.1 Deploy impact volunteering initiatives as part of the City of El Paso Service Plan to connect and mobilize non-profit organizations, corporations and City of El Paso departments in support of key citywide strategic priorities.\nThe City of El Paso will contribute to building non-profit capacity and expanding volunteerism in El Paso by deploying a municipal service plan. The Community and Human Development Department in partnership will lead an effort to connect volunteers with engagement opportunities that address community needs and align with key citywide strategic priorities. The City of El Paso will establish goals for recruiting volunteers for periodic community events while also working with non-profit organizations to establish a base of volunteers for ongoing community work throughout the year.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Cities of Service Neighborhood Associations, Community Advocates,\nResidents\nACTION 3.1.2 Activate a City of El Paso Leadership Community Engagement Council.\nBased on the model established by the University of Texas at El Paso Provost's Community Engagement Council, the City of El Paso will assemble a group of leaders from each city department to focus on expanding structured community based service activities. The intent of the group is to increase community based partnerships, better align planning and implementation of service learning activity and leverage interdepartmental resources toward large-scale community service and civic engagement events. The council also provides a mechanism to keep City Leadership informed with regard to coordinated civic engagement and service activity across the community. The CEC would convene quarterly as a way to continually identify opportunities for collaboration as well as measure progress of ongoing initiatives. Additionally, the CEC would serve as stewards of the City of El Paso Service Plan.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Citywide Department Volunteer Engagement Leaders, UTEP\nEl Pasoans have historically shown little trust in their local government. This led to a citizenry that was generally disengaged from public processes and unsure of how to work with their city government to address issues in their neighborhoods. Residents struggled to understand what services and programs the City provided. A 2004 Citizen Survey of El Pasoans showed that only 22.8% of respondents considered themselves to be \u201cknowledgeable\u201d or \u201cVery Knowledgeable\u201d of City operations, programs and policies. That lack of knowledge and knowhow made it intimidating for many residents to contact the City and request assistance other than for emergency services. As such, the survey also showed that residents generally considered the City to be difficult to work with.\nIn early 2006, the City created a program dedicated to increasing the number of neighborhood associations as well as to empowering residents to work directly with the City. One of the key programs providing that empowerment is the Neighborhood Leadership Academy (NLA). The NLA is a free, 18-week course, provided free of charge by the City of El Paso, that teaches El Pasoans about the operations, programs and policies of the City. Senior management from all City departments that provide services and programs to the public (currently more than 24 different departments) provide on-site field trips and\/or presentations explaining what they do, why they do what they do, how they do it, and how residents and neighborhood associations can utilize their departments' services and programs to address challenges in their neighborhoods. The upcoming NLA course will be the 12th overall, and the first 11 courses saw a total of 423 residents complete the program.\nGRO (Growth, Resilience, Opportunity) has served as an opportunity to learn how sustainable living can support the development of a strong, healthy, and resilient El Paso. GRO allows for informationonchallengesto be sharedand showcase best practices while involving the community in the development of lasting solutions. It highlights actions and solutions to solve increasingly critical concerns regarding the environment, human health and ongoing economic development. The intent of GRO in 2014 & 2015 was to activate a positive dialogue centered on collaborative solution based thinking planning and implementation practices that can propel the community forward and set the example for other communities struggling with the same challenges.\nThe evolution and success of GRO has led to a more robust program, deployed in April of each year, that is more action based leveraging more hands on activities and demonstrations. Events include service projects and celebrations that emphasize key resilience challenges and opportunities for El Paso.\nGrowth\nThe evolution of our community through inclusive processes that begin with increasing knowledge, understanding and capacity building for all segments of the community. Positive growth is dependent on the capacity to move forward; learning from our mistakes and capitalizing on our success.\nResilience\nEl Paso's ability to be resilient lies in the strength of our culture, our capacity for public engagement and the positive manner in which we choose to shape our own future.\nOpportunity\nThe formation of a set of circumstances that can make anything possible. GRO is about making sure everyone has a role to play in our sustainable future.\nACTION 3.1.3 Implement Civic Design Labs in advance of major city initiatives including capital projects, policy initiatives and strategic planning updates.\nThe City of El Paso will be responsible for leading interactive community sessions with a variety of stakeholders and community members as a tool to maximize resilience value for major city initiatives. The Civic Design Lab format offers an innovative way to actively engage the community, building upon the model tested in the Chamizal neighborhood in the spring of 2016. By replicating the design lab structure for more than just physical projects, the City of El Paso moves toward a shared visioning model for future policy, project and planning development. The City of El Paso Resilience team will leverage 100RC partnerships to establish training for key departments across so that implementation strategies will be embedded across the organizational structure.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 5 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Neighborhood Associations, Community Advocates, Residents, 100 Resilient Cities\nGOAL 3.2\nConnect people to citywide assets and programs that address community challenges, promote community vitality and improve quality of life.\nACTION 3.2.1 Implement ongoing community learning programs focused on healthy,\nsustainable living practices supportive of grass roots resilience building.\nThe City of El Paso will implement a Resilience Ambassadors Program to expand its reach and impact by training volunteers in specific sustainability and neighborhood improvement skills. With the guidance of subject-matter experts, these skilled volunteers conduct miniretrofits and improvements for local El Paso businesses. The goal of this program is to improve the resilience of our community by decreasing energy and water use, increasing awareness about conservation and sustainability efforts, and encouraging impact volunteering.\nThe current cohort of Resilience Ambassadors have been trained on how to install pre-rinse sprayers and faucet aerators and use caulking and weather-stripping to seal air leaks. We will continue to expand this program to include training in skills such as garden construction, tree planting, bioswale installation, and other neighborhood improvement skills.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Cities of Service, CNCS VISTA Program, Neighborhood Associations,\nCommunity Advocates, Residents\nIn August 2015, El Paso was selected to participate in the Resilience AmeriCorps program, a first of its kind effort to support local resiliencebuilding efforts. El Paso was one of only 10 cities in the United States to be selected for our committment to resilience building. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) partnered with The Rockefeller Foundation and Cities of Service to place AmeriCorps VISTA members in communities to provide capacity building and technical support for climate resilience. Through the program, two AmeriCorps VISTA members were placed within the City of El Paso organizational structure to provide much needed capacity to build sustainable food systems and impact volunteering initiatives. In addition, $25,000 in direct funding was awarded to support the impact volunteering projects. As a result of the Resilience AmeriCorps program, two successful initiatives were launched, including the Garden Grant Program and the Resilience Ambassadors. The Garden Grant program funded the construction of seven garden beds which produced over 200 pounds of food over the Fall 2017 planting season. The Resilience Ambassadors program trained 18 community volunteers in water and energy retrofits. These volunteers installed over 150 aerators, which led to one business reducing their water bills by $1,241 over five months. The two AmeriCorps VISTAs also drafted a Service Plan and Sustainable Food Systems Framework for the City of El Paso which will help drive change over the next decade.\nAs a member of the Resilience AmeriCorps program El Paso has demonstrated commitment to citizen inclusion and respect for community input resulting in an atmosphere of shared leadership and collaboration. Building relationships between government and residents contributes to a stronger more resilient city.\nOur team believes that the traditional design, present, defend model of community engagement in planning is inadequate to get meaningful community feedback. The City of El Paso seeks to activate the agency of El Paoans via alternative means that physically, intellectually and emotionally connects with people; allowing them to interact with and provide real time feedback on temporary representations of the possibilities for their neighborhood.\nExperiential engagement opportunities include events like Cycle for Salsa bringing forward examples of great street design practices alongside a retaking of the street for community revitalization. Other alternative concepts involve live programming in unexpected places, art installations and pop up interactive exhibits.\nSuccess for us means a transformation of public perception regarding the power of well designed places (including streets) to improve quality of life.\nIt also means transforming the rote approach taken by public agencies when \u201cengaging\u201d community. The intention is to broaden the lens under which project value is viewed, increasing the number factors that influence cost benefit analysis. This model is a way for the City and its partners to work together in creating an entirely new approach to street design, neighborhood improvement and public engagement practices. Through this alternative approach, El Paso has the potential to reach the critical mass necessary to robustly achieve positive change, specifically for the most vulnerable within our culturally vibrant urban core.\nACTION 3.2.2 Implement place-based solutions in key locations across El Paso neighborhoods to connect communities and city agencies.\nThe City of El Paso will implement discrete, neighborhood-scale green urban intervention projects, developed through an inclusive planning process with local residents. These initiatives, while providing additional open space enhancements to an area, will serve as a living lab to showcase benefits to quality of life. Our team believes that the traditional design, present, defend model of community engagement in planning is inadequate to get meaningful community feedback.

The City of El Paso alongside key community partners will build new policies and programs to both food security and a healthy future for all El Pasoans. The role of the City of El Paso will be to respond to identified challenges through local policy initiatives as well as municipal operations support for key programs. Together, the partnership identify strengths and vulnerabilities in El Paso's food system and work to address potential gaps by drafting policy ideas, initiatives, and even potential backup plans in the event of an emergency.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Institute for Healthy Living, E.P.

While this program has been in place for about a decade, capacity has limited the number of El Pasoans assisted. The City of El Paso will launch an expansion of this program with the intention of doubling the number of First Time Homebuyers by 2019. In concert with the program expansion, the department of Community and Human Development will expand access to educational programs for applicants in the areas of personal financial management, and conservation best practices for utility cost management.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Project VIDA, El Paso Electric, El Paso Water, USGBC TX, Cities of Service\nACTION 3.3.2 Connect residents with existing community development funding sources targeted at home repair and neighborhood improvement for low income population.\nThe City of El Paso will leverage community partnerships to promote awareness and expand access to existing low-cost loans for home improvements for low to moderate income families and individuals. These loans, for amounts up to $65,000 can be repaid and\/or deferred up to 30 years. With a current interest rate of 0%, the program makes much needed improvements to existing homes accessible for El Pasoans who traditionally cannot afford to do so. By focusing improvement funding on projects that can reduce future maintenance and utility costs for residents, the program supports financial stability for participants beyond the physical benefit to the home.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: El Paso Electric, El Paso Water, USGBC TX, Cities of Service, Neighborhood Associations\nACTION 3.3.3 Create the City of El Paso Senior Corps program by consolidating resources and staff toward the enhancement of the Retired Senior Volunteer Program and the Foster Grandparent Program.\nThe Retired Senior Volunteer Program and the Foster Grandparent Programs have existed as an offering of the City of El Paso for over 30 years. Since their inception, both programs have achieved significant success and engaged an enormous number of El Pasoans. However, in recent years, programs funded at the federal and state levels have been asked to do increasingly more with significantly fewer resources. In order to adapt to these changing conditions while continuing to expand programming, the City of El Paso has aligned these two programs and created a Senior Corps for our community. The Senior Corps is a program that will provide enrichment for older adults through community service. It encourages seniors to bring a lifetime of talent, experience, skills, and hobbies to the forefront in service of community projects, organizations, and agencies in need.\nIn addition, the Senior Corps will serve as a model for the development of other volunteer engagement programs for target population needs. Next steps will be to explore the potential for engagement of veterans and active military families as well as children and youth.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: CNCS, Cities of Service, Neighborhood Associations, Ft.

The plan is built so that it can be continuously adapted based on department feedback, modifications to planning approaches and community priorities. In order to further resilience building and create broader regional alignment, The City of El Paso will consistently reference the Strategic Plan when working with external partners such as the Greater Chamber of Commerce, El Paso County leadership and Borderplex Alliance among others.\nACTION LEAD: City of El Paso Performance Office\nPARTNERS: All City Strategic Planning Goal Teams\nACTION 4.1.2 Ensure ongoing execution of strategic planning goals and actions through continuous reporting, accountability and budget alignment.\nThe City of El Paso ties its budget process to its strategic plan in several ways. First, City Council's priorities are identified and developed into specific strategies every year. By doing this early on, the Office of Management and Budget is able to formulate how to fund the different initiatives. Second, the budget is categorized and presented by Goal teams instead of by departments. Rather than seeing separate presentations for Libraries, Museums, Parks, and Zoo, they are all combined into one goal of Quality of Life. This allows City Council to see how much is being allocated to the individual departments as well as towards achieving the goal of an improved quality of life for all residents. Key Performance Indicators are reported by Goal teams as well since they are operationally linked through the services that are provided. Furthermore, supplemental requests to the budget are required to be directly linked to a strategic planning goal as well as illustrate how the request contributes to their goal within the strategic plan, and how that success will be measured.\nThe City of El Paso has already integrated resilience concepts into the City Strategic Plan and as such has embedded resilience within the city budgeting process. As resilience building work moves forward, the City of El Paso Performance Office and the Office of Budget and Management in partnership with the Chief Resilience Officer will further align operational budgets to identified resilience goals. Alignment will be guided by best practices gathered from across the 100 Resilient Cities Network.\nACTION LEAD: City of El Paso Performance Office\nPARTNERS: All City Strategic Planning Goal Teams, Office of Budget and Management\nEl Paso will be a world class, highly competitive international border community that draws trade, technology, and tourism to its cultural, geographic, and environmental attractions through unparalleled interregional and binational cooperation.\nInternational Trade\nLeverage El Paso's binational border location and unique assets to draw more businesses and trade to the area including preserving and expanding existing businesses.\nBorder Health Issues\nImprove the health of all border residents through binational health organizations that target health issues unique to the United States\/Mexico border to ensure there are sufficient preventive and health resources on both sides of the border.\nCultural Vitality\nPortray a strong identity that includes the unique Mexican\/American cultural vitality and historical\nintegration of both El Paso and Juarez.\nBinational Education\nRaise education levels in the region in order to compete in the global arena.\nBorder Transportation\nCreate the most efficient and reliable international passenger and commercial transportation systems to facilitate the movement of goods, services, and people across the US\/Mexico border.\nImmigration Reform\nStrengthen the entire border community by supporting innovative immigration reform through training and educational opportunities.\nGOAL 4.2\nCultivate local, regional and global relationships supportive of cooperative resilience building efforts.\nACTION 4.2.1 Take a leading role in the global network of resilience practice.\nBecause El Paso has the unique position of serving as a desert-oriented, binational city, the City of El Paso is committed to communicating successes and highlighting progress towards goals with the 100 Resilient Cities network, Cities of Service, Urban Land Institute, and other partners. City leadership will share El Paso's work and strategic approach to resilience in publications, conferences and other resilience-related events, highlighting the role of the bi-national metroplex and what that means in terms of building global best practices.

The task force will identify priorities for the binational community and make recommendations to be considered by both city councils at regularly scheduled bi-national council meetings held in alternating locations on both sides of the border. The task force provides the framework for an ongoing collaborative decision making vehicle with the capacity to align efforts on an international scale.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Ciudad Juarez\nA key factor in El Paso's continuing economic vibrancy is Fort Bliss. Some parts of this Army installation are actually within the City limits while vast training areas and base camps extend north to, and across, the New Mexico state line, over a million acres deep into neighboring Dona Ana and Otero Counties. The effects of\nFort Bliss extend well beyond its boundaries. In addition to nearly 3,500 units of on-post housing in fifteen neighborhoods, a large proportion of military housing is located off- post throughout the City. The current population at Fort Bliss includes 29,255 active-duty soldiers, 2,640 reservists, 44,468 family members, and 7,755 civilians. Geographically the Fort Bliss Military Post is within the El Paso ISD School boundaries with one high school and four elementary schools located within the post. EPISD built, staffs, and oversees the following schools on post:\n\u2022\tChapin High School with 26.81% military students,\n\u2022\tBliss Elementary School with 78.19% military students\n\u2022\tLogan Elementary School with 70.91% military students\n\u2022\tMilam Elementary School with 99.12% military students\n\u2022\tPowell Elementary School with 93.69% military students\nFort Bliss was originally located near Downtown El Paso and later at several other locations within today's City limits. In 1893 the post was moved to West Fort Bliss, just west of the El Paso International Airport.\nFort Bliss became a major military training center as the onset of World War II triggered a boom in El Paso's economy. By 1942 Fort Bliss was the largest Army base in the nation. After the war, Biggs Air Force Base established itself as an important military post in the region. Biggs was closed in 1966 and reactivated as Biggs Army Airfield in 1973. Fort Bliss is currently home to the 1st Armored division.\nGOAL 4.3\nConnect people and initiatives across the region, activating the bi-national community.\nACTION 4.3.1 Develop regional scale community events focused on connecting people across borders.\nCollaborating with a variety of local and regional leadership as well as community-based groups in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, the City of El Paso will support the implementation of community events focused on resilience building and social cohesion. Potential event topics may include a celebration of the ongoing relationship between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, health and wellness educational opportunities, or economic development networking among businesses and related partners, among other initiatives. At least two regional community events will be executed annually.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 8 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: Ciudad Juarez, UTEP, Velo Paso Bicycle Pedestrian Coalition, USGBC Texas, Borderplex Alliance Innovation Frontera\nACTION 4.3.2 Promote bi-national and interstate adoption of regional planning best practices.\nBased on scientific research and best practices, El Paso will partner closely with Ciudad Juarez and the communities of Southern New Mexico to outline ambitious infrastructure and development goals for the region and work with related partners to make progress towards those goals. The city will also support coordination efforts with academic institutions, such as The University of Texas at El Paso, to guide policy and program planning while also supporting interagency collaborative efforts.\nACTION LEAD: Goal 1 Strategic Planning Team\nPARTNERS: UTEP, Borderplex2020 Regional Planning Task Force, BECC, Ciudad Juarez, RGCOG, County of El Paso\nThe El Paso \/ Las Cruces \/ Juarez Metroplex has taken on an important, complex and very high potential program aimed at improving the innovation culture in their region. This is a tough challenge and it's complicated, nuanced and often hard to define. Overcoming the challenge, the Innovation Frontera identified several key components to success:\n\u2022 Grow a vibrant interconnected innovation ecosystem \u2022 Foster connectivity, trust and collaboration \u2022 Celebrate role models, lower barriers and activate networks \u2022 Adaptive prideful messaging for the region \u2022 Cultivate openness, serendipity and willingness to take risk \u2022 Activate the global opportunity for the innovation frontera\nPURPOSE OF INNOVATION FRONTERA: To create prosperity without borders.\nAs part of the first steps of this effort, the collaborative group came together to establish a social contract, or method of working together emphasizing cooperation, diversity, trust and binational experimentation. Each participating organization commits to the tenets established. That contract came to fruition as follows:\n\u2022 I am joining a diverse inclusive global community of people who share a belief in the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. I commit to collaborating as part of a bi-national community for the betterment of our region, El Paso, Cuidad Juarez, and southern New Mexico a\n\u2022 I will recognize, celebrate, and encourage role models publicly. I am committed to grow as a role model of innovation and to evolve to as an individual, a worker, a family member, and community member.\n\u2022 I understand that I will receive valuable help from others for free or at a very low cost. I agree to \u201cpay forward\u201d whatever positive benefits I receive.\n\u2022 I will give trust to others before expecting to receive trust in return. I will treat everyone fairly and respectfully.\n\u2022 Collaborate, Collaborate, Collaborate. Together we will be more innovative. I will bring people together, participate in gatherings of others, and invite and encourage others to collaborate to identify problems and innovate toward solutions that benefit the community.\n\u2022 I will dream, experiment, iterate, and persist. I will encourage others to do the same. I understand that mistakes and failure are acceptable ways of testing new ideas. I will open myself to learning from others. I will help nurture learning in others.\n\u2022 I will live these ideals as a member of this bi-national global community. I will share these ideals and encourage other to embrace them.","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["Rio Grande River","U.S.","El Paso ISD","Lincoln Park","USGBC Texas","City","Red Sands","West Texas","El

Coast,\nbecoming the costliest disaster in United States history. As that fateful storm shrouded\nour city in darkness, the federal levee system protecting New Orleans failed, flooding 80 percent of our city and the homes and businesses of 1 million people in the region.\nIn total, Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath claimed over 1,800 lives.\nAfter the last decade of Katrina, Rita, Ike, Gustav, Isaac, the BP oil spill, and the Great\nRecession, it is safe to say that New Orleans has faced the biggest challenges any\nAmerican city has ever faced. But New Orleans is a resilient place with resilient people.\nWith resolve, determination, and commitment from the entire nation across public,\nprivate, and philanthropic sectors, we not only came back, but we are rebuilding\nNew Orleans better and stronger than before.\nEven as some continue to deal with the effects of Katrina and the federal levee\nfailure, there are new challenges that confront us\u2014climate change and rising sea\nlevels, land subsidence and coastal erosion, and lack of equity and opportunity for all\nNew Orleanians to grow and thrive. For our city, being resilient means more than levees holding back water and wetlands protecting us from storms. It means striking a balance between human needs and the environment that surrounds us while also combating the chronic stresses of violence, poverty, and inequality.\nAs we look to our future challenges and opportunities, our innovative spirit will help us\nfind creative solutions that protect the city's people, culture, and infrastructure. Our\ncommitment to action will define the next chapter of the city's history. We must seize\nthe moment. We not only have an opportunity to continue in the positive direction of the past several years, we have a responsibility to get it right and set the city on a more just and sustainable path for generations to come. We cannot afford to fail.\nAs we move beyond the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina toward our city's 300th\nanniversary in 2018, I am calling on each of you to join in our shared vision of becoming\na global leader in urban resilience.\nSincerely,\nMitchell J. Landrieu Mayor\nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\nThree years from now, New Orleans will\nenter its fourth century. When it is home to the next generation of New Orleanians, what sort of place will it be?\nThe actions we take today will shape our future city for the coming generation. What must we do now to make the\nnext generation more equitable, more\nadaptable, and more prosperous?\nHow can we make their New Orleans a\ndynamic urban landscape\u2014aligned with\nits natural environment? What leadership is needed\u2014from individuals, communities, and the public and private sectors\u2014to\nrealize the city we envision?\nResilient New Orleans addresses these\nquestions and sets forth aspirations to\nguide our work and specific actions to\ntackle these challenges. We are building\nupon the existing visions and plans\ndeveloped over the past decade. Guided by 100 Resilient Cities\u2014Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, Resilient New Orleans combines local expertise with global best practices to confront our most urgent threats and seek ways to redress our legacy of inequity and risk. We propose bold yet pragmatic actions to adapt our city to our changing natural environment, invest in equity, create flexible and reliable systems, and prepare for future shocks.\nOur approach is organized into three\nsections, each with a vision for our\nfuture city.\nADAPT TO THRIVE\nWe are a city that embraces our\nchanging environment.\nBy adapting our city to our natural\nenvironment and the risks of climate\nchange, we can create opportunities\nfor all New Orleanians to thrive. We\nmust align our infrastructure and\nurban environment with the realities\nof our delta soils and geography. Our\nadaptation must be both physical and\nbehavioral. Rather than resist water, we\nmust learn to embrace it, building on\nthe confluence of Louisiana's culture,\nhistory, and natural systems. As we look\nto the wisdom of the past, we must also\nprepare for the risks of the future.\nWe will adapt to thrive by advancing the restoration of our coastal wetlands, which protect our communities and support our economy. We will implement our regional Urban Water Plan to reduce flood risk,\nmitigate soil subsidence, and beautify our communities. We will provide incentives to property owners to retrofit their\nhomes to be more resilient to storms. We will further environmental stewardship programs to create a culture of\nenvironmental awareness at every stage of life. Just as we adapt to our changing climate, we will also commit to mitigating our own contribution to climate change.\nCONNECT TO OPPORTUNITY\nWe are an equitable city.\nBy investing in equity, we are investing\nin resilience. Equity will be the driving\nforce behind our economy's growth and\ninnovation, our communities' safety and\nstability, and our families' health and\nprosperity. While New Orleans' economic recovery and growth in recent years has been remarkable, it has not been enjoyed equitably. We will grow our economy by investing in stable, healthy communities where individuals have the training,\naccess, and support needed to connect\nto opportunity.\nTo build equity, we will invest in the\nfinancial stability of our low-income\nhouseholds. We will work to narrow\nthe digital divide to lower the barrier\nto workforce participation. We will\ncontinue to invest in homicide reduction, public safety, and social cohesion. We will continue to improve the health\nof our communities and expand\naccess to affordable housing through\nintegrated policy and investment.\nTRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS\nWe are a dynamic and prepared city.\nWe are building a New Orleans for the\nfuture\u2014one that embraces change,\nprepares for the risks of the future, and\nhonors our traditions. To achieve this\nvision, we must not only adapt, we must transform. Through better management, coordination, and service delivery, we\ncan unlock value by improving daily life\nwhile also preparing the city as a whole\nfor future shocks. By modernizing our\noperational systems, we will better equip residents and businesses to evolve from consumers of public services to partners in addressing shared challenges.\nWe propose to achieve this by\nredesigning our regional transit systems to connect people, employment, and essential services. We will promote\nsustainability as a growth strategy,\nseeking ways to increase energy\nefficiency and renewable energy sources. This strategy calls for investment to increase the redundancy and reliability of our energy infrastructure with\nmicrogrids. The City of New Orleans\nwill establish the Mayor's Office\nof Resilience and Sustainability to\nintegrate resilience-driven decision\nmaking across public agencies and\nthe Center for Resilience to deliver the\noutreach and education components\nof building community resilience. We\nwill develop a pre-disaster plan for\npost-disaster recovery that prepares\nthe city to rebound quickly and\nemerge stronger. Through a small\nbusiness resilience initiative, we will develop the preparedness of our business owners and entrepreneurs.\nFor centuries, we have demonstrated our ability to innovate and adapt in the face of major challenges. While New Orleans has recovered from many shocks in\nthe past, our future is threatened by\nrising seas and coastal erosion, crime\nand a lack of economic opportunity,\nincome inequality and disparate health\noutcomes. We now stand before a\ncritical threshold. We must move beyond the devastation of the past and cross into the possibilities of the future.\nNew Orleans will continue to lead, serving as an urban laboratory for innovation and change, working to recognize and adapt to an unpredictable future, and remaining committed to the equitable adaptation and transformation of coastal cities worldwide. As a global leader, we have a responsibility to seek wisdom and guidance from around the world, to listen to the stories of our peers, and to share our progress toward shaping the future city\u2014a Resilient New Orleans.\nShaping the Future City\nNew Orleans is becoming a global leader in resilience thinking\nand action. We are moving beyond our recovery to focus on our\nfuture, and this strategy outlines many deliberate steps forward.\nWe are now stronger, more knowledgeable, and more innovative than ever before. We are positioned to build the future city: one that is responsive to our delta and coastal geography, locally\nforged and globally connected, and founded on the equity of\nopportunity and social mobility. While our challenges are many,\nour will and capacity to act have never been greater.\nThe children born in 2015 will be 35 years old in 2050. What\nwe do today will help determine their future and the future of\ntheir city. The next generation will be more equitable, more\nadaptable, and more prosperous. As children, they will have\nbetter educational opportunities; as young adults, they will have better mobility throughout the region; and as adults, they will have better career opportunities and a safer city in which to raise their own families.\nWhen we imagine the future New Orleans, we see a dynamic\nurban landscape that is aligned with its natural environment\u2014\nwe embrace living with water. We envision strong leadership\nfrom individuals, businesses, and public agencies that prioritize\nbuilding city resilience. We see a city where every individual\nhas access to the education, services, and resources needed\nto succeed; safe and affordable housing; employment; and the\ntransportation to get there.\nWe are building the future New Orleans today.\nOUR RESILIENCE\nCHALLENGE\nMany of the threats to New Orleans are\nnot surprises to residents or visitors.\nThe most prominent environmental\nshocks come in the form of severe\nstorms or hurricanes and flooding\nevents. The impacts from these events\nare only exacerbated by the presence\nof cumulative physical stresses, like land subsidence and coastal wetland loss, and social stresses, like poor economic, educational, and health outcomes among vulnerable populations.\nCity resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city\nto survive, adapt, and grow no matter\nwhat kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nOur environment is changing.\nClimate change is accelerating it.\nNew Orleans was founded in the 18th century due to its strategic location for commerce in the Mississippi River Delta and on the Gulf of Mexico. Today, the natural systems upon which the city was built continue to sustain the city, but also threaten it. The deltaic soils underfoot and the wetlands that largely surround the city are part of a shifting coastal landscape that offers unique challenges for the built environment. The natural and coastal systems of Southeast Louisiana are directly connected to the urbanized area of New Orleans, providing natural\nprotections from storms and storm surge and creating landscapes for economic development.\nShocks like hurricanes are compounded by daily stresses on the city's natural and built environment. The rapid loss of coastal wetlands puts extra stress on the city's flood protection system, while hard surfaces that do not absorb water and sinking urban soils exacerbate flood risk from regular rainfall. Sea level rise and a projected increase in frequency and intensity of storm events are expected to accelerate coastal land loss, adding greater stresses to our levee and flood protection system, while more extreme heat will directly threaten other infrastructure systems and the health of our residents. We are already\nfacing many climate change-related\nchallenges in advance of other cities\nand regions around the world due to our unique geography.\nCity resilience is about more than building stronger infrastructure to hold back the water and withstand the wind. Our capacity to adapt is founded on our knowledge and learning from past experiences with shocks and stresses. However, some fundamental aspects of our existence as a coastal city have been hidden behind walls and under asphalt, including our slowly sinking deltaic soils and our disappearing wetlands. While we now may recognize the risks that a hurricane presents, we still lack a widespread public awareness of how climate change increases the future risks to our city.\nWe will continue to adapt to our semi-\naquatic home. With a comprehensive\ncoastal master plan and implementation\nstrategy, Louisiana is already taking\naction on coastal protection and\nrestoration efforts. Today, New Orleans\nis ready to be an urban model for living\nwith water and adapting to the rapid\nenvironmental changes that will only\naccelerate with climate change.\nEquity is critical to our resilience.\nMany New Orleanians suffer the chronic\nsocial stresses of poverty, unemployment, and violence. Wide disparities exist in employment and wages, educational attainment, and health outcomes. These social stresses are correlated with a\ngreater vulnerability to physical shocks:\nlow-income households in New Orleans\nare more likely to be located in areas\nat greater risk of flooding and land\nsubsidence. These chronic stresses\ncompound the risks of intermittent\nshocks, leaving our communities that\nalready experience inequity further\nexposed to risk, and weakening our\nresilience as a city.\nEven as we look to the future, we cannot ignore past injustices. Racial inequity is present in every facet of our society\u2014 employment and income, education and health, violence and justice, housing\nand social mobility. To advance as\na city, we must confront this reality\ncollectively and seek meaningful ways\nto address its effects in our institutions,\nour communities, and our families. With\na strategy that prioritizes racial equity,\nwe will be stronger as a society and more capable of responding to adversity.\nThe future is uncertain.\nAs we seek to make resilience thinking a part of our daily practice, we must plan and prepare for a future that remains\nuncertain. Even in our recent history, new challenges have emerged. For example, following the levee failures and floods of 2005, New Orleans spent years preparing for another major storm event, only to be shocked in 2010 by BP's drilling rig\nexplosion and oil spill\u2014considered the\nlargest environmental disaster in US\nhistory\u2014which sent over 210 million\ngallons (780,000 cubic meters) of oil\nflowing across our coast.\nWhile not common to our city, other\npotential threats could include terrorist\nattacks, infectious disease epidemics,\ndrought, and civil unrest. We might not\nknow what shocks we will face, but we\ndo know our future will be dynamic\nand complex. We need transportation\nsystems that can get us to work every\nmorning, but also move us to safety\nduring a crisis. We need electricity and\nwater systems that we can count on to\nkeep us productive and that we know\nwill perform under stress. We need a\ngovernment that is agile enough to\ndeliver critical services to all people in\nall conditions. By creating systems that\nare flexible enough to address multiple\nchallenges and reliable enough to\ncontinue to support us, we can shape\na city that can thrive no matter what\nmay happen.\nREGIONAL TRENDS\nWe have abandoned our long history of living with water. For the first two centuries of the city's existence, we occupied the high ground nearest the Mississippi River and the natural ridges throughout the region. With the advent of highly efficient pumping technology in the early 20th century, the draining of swampland in low-lying parts of the city and region incentivized new development to spread into previously uninhabitable locations. With this development came suburbanization and regional sprawl, setting the stage for challenges to our water management and flood protection systems, as well as to our ability to connect residents to regional job opportunities.\nFrom Strategy\nto Implementation\nSTRATEGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nWe developed this strategy by researching the challenges facing New Orleans, gathering input from stakeholders with relevant knowledge and expertise, and sourcing best practices from around the world.\nWe investigated the city's shocks, stresses, and assets. We met with local organizations and stakeholders to understand how the city's resilience is perceived today, to gather local best practices, and to devise new approaches.\nOver 350 individuals participated throughout the process and provided valuable insight into what contributes to and detracts from the city's resilience, what local expertise and knowledge exist, and what specific needs are not being met. In addition, the Office of Neighborhood Engagement convened\na summit of neighborhood leaders to solicit perspectives on city resilience.\nThis research was then compiled in the Preliminary Resilience Assessment and grouped into focus areas. Working groups, composed of local and outside experts, met to further explore each focus area and propose potential approaches and solutions. This, in turn, led to a more detailed analysis of the opportunities within each focus area and resulted in more specific workshops on issues such as financing, risk modeling, and design. The proposals developed through this process directly inspired the actions set forth in this document.\n50-year planning: The plan accounts for\nacute shocks and long-term risks associated with coastal erosion, as well as the inherent uncertainty in the coast's future.\nLiving with water: The Urban\nWater Plan pioneered the vision\nfor embracing water for the\nfuture of our region.\nNew Capital Plan adopted\nPlanning for equity: This plan highlights equity as a growth strategy for our economic\ndevelopment.\nFocus on our youth: NOLA\nFOR LIFE prioritizes youth\nengagement and education to\nbuild a safer and healthier society.\n100 Resilient Cities\n- Pioneered by The\nRockefeller Foundation (100RC) helps cities around the world\nbecome more resilient\nto the physical,\nsocial, and economic\nchallenges that are a\ngrowing part of the\n21st century. 100RC\nprovides this assistance through funding for a chief resilience officer in each member city to lead resilience efforts; resources for drafting a resilience strategy; membership in a global network of peer cities to share best practices and challenges, and access to a variety of resilience tools, including the City Resilience Framework. New Orleans was one of the first members of the 100 Resilient\nCities Network, and\nResilient New Orleans\nwas supported by the\n100RC process.\nOUR APPROACH\nWorking to build resilience is different\nthan conducting business as usual. It\nmeans breaking down traditional divisions between agencies and organizations to find common purposes. It means designing to deal with the next event rather than just assessing the last one. It means improving our cities today in ways that also make them better prepared for the risks of tomorrow.\nOur guidepost for designing a strategy\nthat achieves these outcomes has been\nthe City Resilience Framework. The\nframework, developed by Arup with\nsupport from The Rockefeller Foundation, is made up of four dimensions\u2014Health & Well-being, Economy & Society,\nInfrastructure & Environment, and\nLeadership & Strategy\u2014and is further\ndefined by 12 drivers of resilience. We\nused the framework throughout the\nprocess to assess the connections\nbetween our challenges, identify critical\nareas of weakness, and develop actions\nthat build upon our strengths. We\nalso used the framework to facilitate a\ncomprehensive discussion of resilience\nwith our stakeholders.\nAt each stage of the process, we\nalso relied on the qualities of resilient\nsystems as a touchstone to guide\nthe development of our actions. We\ncontinually sought strategies that were:\n\u2022 Reflective: informed by our past experiences\n\u2022 Resourceful: made efficient use of our limited resources and attracted new resources\n\u2022 Robust: were designed to be strong but also could fail safely\n\u2022 Redundant: had backup or spare capacity when needed\n\u2022 Flexible: had alternative paths to achieve the same outcome\n\u2022 Inclusive: involved those who bear risk and responsibility\n\u2022 Integrated: coordinated across public and private organizations to achieve common purposes\nThe Resilience Dividend\nBy using this approach to evaluate and\nset priorities, New Orleans will achieve\nthe Resilience Dividend: Instead of\ninvesting to reduce impacts from a single hazard or improve a single metric, the city will make strategic decisions to\nimprove its overall strength and endure\nmultiple shocks and stresses. Investing\nin resilience can save money, save\nlives, and build a more equitable and\nprosperous city.\nDeveloping a reliable and comprehensive multimodal transit network will help New Orleans be more resilient whether the challenge is to be efficient and coordinated in times of emergency response, to enable low-income families to connect to\nopportunity, or to improve safety and connectivity.\nThe point of entry might seem like a single\ninfrastructure project, but it has the potential to\ncreate benefits across sectors, scales, and potential\nshocks. This is the Resilience Dividend in action.\nREDUCES HARMFUL EMISSIONS CONNECTS PEOPLE TO JOBS\nPROVIDES EMERGENCY CAPACITY\nIMPLEMENTATION &\nMONITORING\nOur strategies will only be as effective\nas our ability to act. This document\nserves as a focal point and initial work\nplan for taking action to build resilience.\nThe newly formed Mayor's Office of\nResilience and Sustainability and the chief resilience officer will have responsibility for implementing the strategy by\ncoordinating with partners and agencies. The office will advise the mayor on policy, guide prioritization, and provide regional leadership on resilience. To further\nintegrate resilience into our regulations,\npolicies, and practices, the office will\nwork closely with the City Planning\nCommission and Hazard Mitigation Office to ensure consistency with the City's Master Plan and Hazard Mitigation Plan.\nBy coordinating regionally, we can solve\nimmediate and long-term problems\nthat no single municipality or parish\ncan address. Single jurisdictions cannot\neffectively build better levee systems,\nrestore the coast, create stronger\neconomies, ensure safe and affordable\nhousing for our workforce, or build a\ntransportation systems that will serve\nus into the future. It is only through\ncooperation among cities and towns\nacting together as a region that we will\nbe able to effectively engage these\nchallenges.\nThe principles and actions outlined in\nthis strategy are designed for results and immediate benefits, but with long-term aspirations founded on the concept of generational change.\nThe City will develop indicators and\ntargets to track the progress of this\nstrategy. The Office of Performance and\nAccountability (OPA), which promotes\nbetter city services through data-driven\nmanagement, decisionmaking, and\naccountability, will support the Mayor's\nOffice of Resilience and Sustainability to develop and track these measures. The City will make the data available publicly through ResultsNOLA, its quarterly\nreporting program for performance\nmanagement.\nDEMONSTRATING\nGLOBAL LEADERSHIP\nFor centuries, we have demonstrated our ability to innovate and adapt in the face of major challenges, making New Orleans well known as a model of community-\nbased recovery and resilience. Today,\nNew Orleans is continuing to lead, serving as an urban laboratory for innovation and change, working to prepare for an unpredictable future, and remaining committed to the equitable adaptation and transformation of coastal cities\nworldwide.\nAs part of the growing 100 Resilient\nCities Network, we have been able to\nconnect with resilience leaders around\nthe world to learn from their wisdom\nand experience, while also sharing our\nown. New Orleans was the site of the\ninaugural Chief Resilience Officer Summit in November 2014, where we had the opportunity to showcase our progress along with the challenges that remain.\nThe summit reminded us that resilience as a practice should always be grounded in our everyday lives and that ideas for our collective future might not always come\nfrom the places we expect. As a global leader, we have a responsibility to seek wisdom and guidance from all continents, to listen to the stories of our peers, and to share our progress toward shaping the future city.\nFUNDING\nFunding for the actions and initiatives outlined in this strategy will be derived from various sources, including existing government budgets, new grants and revenues, philanthropic funds, and private partnerships.\nLeveraging and maximizing existing sources of funding is a top priority. Aligning the City's budgetary priorities with the resilience strategy, by utilizing the resources we already have to achieve multiple benefits, is the first step to investing in a resilient future. Strategically programming new sources of funds, particularly those that can be targeted to\nbuild resilience, like RESTORE Act funds, the BP Settlement, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Grant program, and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) National Disaster Resilience Competition, will provide a down payment on our future.\nBeyond locally controlled funds, the City of New Orleans will continue to partner with federal and state agencies on their projects that have a direct impact on the future of the city. An example is strengthening the partnership between the City and the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) on projects both inside the city and outside the city that have a direct impact on our resilience.\nIn addition, where the actions in this resilience strategy are aligned with the investments and missions of our private sector partners, we will seek to expand the partnerships to support these initiatives.\nVisions and Actions\nThe following sections outline our many interconnected challenges and lay out strategic approaches and goals for each challenge. In order to achieve each goal, a series of strategic actions will be implemented,\nfocused both on immediate results and generational change. The\ninitiatives within these sections are both ambitious and pragmatic,\nboth short term and long term. Most are new, while others are already\nsucceeding, and we will seek ways to amplify their impact. Some will be implemented immediately, while others will need more study. However, they all have committed organizations and agencies, City support, and potential resources to pursue implementation.\n\u2022 Featured Actions are key initiatives for immediate implementation.\n\u2022 Supporting Actions are projects to be developed in the near future.\n\u2022 Ongoing Actions are examples of initiatives currently underway that demonstrate how New Orleans is already working to build resilience.\n\u2022 Aspirations are the visions we hold for 2050 to guide our actions.\n\u2022 Resilience Values are the multiple benefits, both direct and indirect, that we stand to gain by taking these actions.\nWe recognize that becoming a truly resilient city will require significant investment in both time and resources. It will require the hard work of our public and private leaders, and each and every person who lives and works in our city. This document is a call to action\u2014a statement\nof values that will evolve and focus our activities to build resilience for decades to come.\nThe following pages outline the goals we will pursue and the actions we will take to build our city's resilience. They are organized by three visions for our future city:\nADAPT TO THRIVE\nWe are a city that embraces our changing environment.\nWe will:\n\u2022 Advance coastal protection and restoration\n\u2022 Invest in comprehensive and innovative urban water management\n\u2022 Incentivize property owners to invest in risk reduction\n\u2022 Create a culture of environmental awareness at every stage of life\n\u2022 Commit to mitigating our climate impact\nCONNECT TO OPPORTUNITY\nWe are an equitable city.\nWe will:\n\u2022 Invest in household financial stability\n\u2022 Lower barriers to workforce participation\n\u2022 Continue to promote equitable public health outcomes\n\u2022 Continue to build social cohesion\n\u2022 Expand access to safe and affordable housing\nTRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS\nWe are a dynamic and prepared city.\nWe will:\n\u2022 Redesign our regional transit systems to connect people, employment, and essential services\n\u2022 Promote sustainability as a growth strategy\n\u2022 Improve the redundancy and reliability of our energy infrastructure\n\u2022 Integrate resilience-driven decision making across public agencies\n\u2022 Invest in pre-disaster planning for post-disaster recovery\n\u2022 Develop the preparedness of our businesses and neighborhoods\nWe are a city that embraces\nour changing environment.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS ADAPT TO THRIVE\nIntroduction\nBy adapting our city to our natural environment\nand the increasing risks of climate change, we\ncan create opportunities for all New Orleanians to thrive. Successful adaptation will mean creating resilient systems and a culture of environmental awareness among all New Orleanians.\nThroughout our city's history, water has\nbeen essential to New Orleans' existence but has also threatened it. The only constant in our natural environment since the city's founding in 1718 has been change. New Orleans is built upon some of the newest land in the world\u2014 the shifting soils of the Mississippi River Delta. Prior to the construction of major levees and flood control structures in the 20th century, the Mississippi River spent more than 7,000 years changing course and depositing sand, clay, and silt along its banks to build the land around us. In the past 100 years, we have channelized the river, dug canals, laid pipelines, drained wetlands, and introduced invasive species\u2014all to establish conventional settlement and commercial patterns on a challenging environment.\nLargely due to our own influence, we\nhave been losing the coastal wetlands\nthat sustain us both physically and\neconomically at a rate of more than\n16 square miles (41 square kilometers)\nper year. River levees deprive the delta\nof the necessary sediment to build new\nwetlands; canals and pipelines destabilize marshes, allowing exposure to damaging saltwater. Even in the city, the soft soils\nbeneath us are not static. The ground\nin New Orleans is sinking\u2014as much as\n10 feet over the past 100 years in some\nparts of the city. Known as subsidence,\nthis process is partially a result of our\npractice of pumping water out of the\ncity as quickly as possible, which dries\nand compacts the typically moist soil\u2014\nbuckling streets, bursting pipes, and\ndestabilizing utility poles.\nSea level rise and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme storm events are projected to accelerate coastal land loss, adding greater stresses to our levee and flood protection system, while more extreme heat will directly threaten other infrastructure systems, such as electricity distribution, and the health of our\nresidents. New Orleans is arguably more\nthreatened by global climate change\nthan almost any other US city, but we are also more capable than ever to address its effects.\nNew Orleans is ready to become a global leader in addressing environmental\nOur climate is changing\nA resilient approach to infrastructure designs for multiple benefits, including spaces for recreation, sites for environmental engagement, and opportunities for commerce. Credit: Ripple Effect\n\u201cThis is a floating city, floating below the surface of the water.\u201d\nand climate change. We must align our\ninfrastructure and urban environment\nto the realities of our delta soils and\ngeography. Rather than resist water,\nwe must embrace it, building on the\nconfluence of Louisiana's culture, history, and natural systems. As we look to the wisdom of the past, we must also prepare for the risks of the future.\nThe infrastructure of the future city will\nlook different than it does today. Our\nparks and schoolyards will be designed\nwith native plants and trees to soak up\nwater; our canals and streets will provide greenways for recreation and water management. The infrastructure of the future New Orleans will work with natural systems, be redundant and reliable, provide multiple benefits to residents, and even beautify the city.\n\u2014 Benjamin Latrobe, describing New Orleans, 1819\nOur adaptation must be both physical\nand behavioral. Our historical experience of living with water in Southeast Louisiana has been largely forgotten. Much of our water flows behind walls and through culverts, where we rarely see it. Despite being a place that is so defined by hydrology, we have systematically hidden water from our daily experience. We need spaces where we can regularly encounter the water that surrounds us, learn about how it shapes our city, and explore ways to manage its presence.\nGenerational change starts at a young\nage, with children being exposed to\nwater during swimming lessons, in\nparks, and on neighborhood streets.\nFor our students, incorporating our local geography and hydrology into formal education is essential to begin lifelong learning and engagement with the risks and opportunities of our collective future. With a new generation of emerging\nenvironmental stewards, we are poised\nto become a global leader in sustainable environmental management.\nBeing ready for a dynamic future\neconomy will be an important outcome\nof our successful adaptation. Building\nnew types of infrastructure and\nretrofitting conventional systems\nis already growing our local water\neconomy. More than 14,000 new water\nmanagement jobs have been added to\nour region since 2010, with more growth projected.\nOur future in the Mississippi River Delta\nwill inevitably be wet\u2014with less land\naround us and more intense storms\nprojected\u2014and in order to thrive and\nprosper we need to accept water and\ntransform how we manage it. Our\ndynamic environment both sustains and\nthreatens us in Southeast Louisiana, and our understanding and stewardship of it will only become more critical.\nA resilient approach examines the\nrelationship among critical systems\nand commits to collaboration between\nprivate, public, local, regional, and\nnational actors. We have already\nbegun to work together to protect and\nrestore our coast. We are committed to\ncomprehensive urban water management that will help us live with our abundance of water.\nWe are building the future delta city.\nWe have a responsibility to the next\ngeneration of New Orleanians to be\nreflective of our past and flexible in\nadapting our city and our lives to a new\nreality. We have a responsibility to the\nworld to share our progress.\nWater Boulevards\nToday's conventionally paved streets are full of potholes and require frequent and expensive repairs, due in part to\nsoil subsidence. Innovative street and\npublic realm designs can slow and store rainwater, reducing flooding and slowing subsidence.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS ADAPT TO THRIVE\nAdvance coastal protection and restoration\nFEATURED ACTION\nLeverage critical resources for coastal projects\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority; Greater New Orleans, Inc\nASPIRATION\nThe coast is healthy, functioning,\nand sustains industries, communities, and ecosystems.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nBy protecting and restoring our coast, New Orleans can reduce flood risk, protect critical economic assets,\nand safeguard indispensable wildlife\nhabitat and recreational areas.\nTo improve the flood protection provided by coastal wetlands,\nNew Orleans will support the efforts of the Louisiana Coastal\nProtection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) by leveraging financial\nresources available through the BP settlement, the National Disaster\nResilience Competition, and the RESTORE Act. In partnership with the CPRA, the City will help advance coastal restoration and protection projects in Orleans Parish that benefit the city of New Orleans and the region, providing flood protection, habitat restoration, and\nworkforce opportunities.\nThe Coastal Master Plan's risk reduction targets of \u201c500-year\u201d\nstorm protection can only be achieved through a combination of\n\u201cstructural\u201d flood protection, such as levees and coastal restoration,\nand \u201cnonstructural\u201d approaches, including home elevations and floodproofing measures. New Orleans will be the model for combining these approaches through the development of coastal projects and complementary urban water management strategies and the reduction of risk by adapting the urban environment.\nInvest in comprehensive and\ninnovative urban water management\nFEATURED ACTION\nImplement Urban\nWater Plan projects\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: Sewerage & Water Board of\nNew Orleans; Trust for Public Land; Deltares; Greater New Orleans Foundation; Trimble; New Orleans Redevelopment Authority;\nGNO, Inc\nASPIRATION\nNew Orleans embodies the principle\nof living with water, managing urban\nstormwater and groundwater carefully to align with natural processes and support economic growth.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nThrough comprehensive urban water\nmanagement, New Orleans can lower\ninfrastructure costs, reduce flood risk\nto people and property, temper soil\nsubsidence, and transform unsightly\ninfrastructure into attractive amenities\nthat enhance neighborhoods and\nimprove quality of life.\nThe City of New Orleans will implement comprehensive stormwater management to complement the traditional drainage system of pipes and pumps with green infrastructure that delays and detains stormwater in landscaped spaces. The City is partnering with national and international experts to prioritize projects through a detailed analysis focused on hydrology, economy, and social equity. The City is actively pursuing funding for the first round of projects through FEMA Hazard Mitigation funds and the National Disaster Resilience Competition, among others. Through the incorporation of resilient design and construction standards, we intend to serve as a model for transforming our urban environment to live with water.\nGreater New Orleans Urban Water Plan Lead: GNO, Inc\nPartner: Louisiana State Office of Community Development Launched: 2013\nThe transformative vision for living with water in Greater\nNew Orleans directly addresses groundwater and\nstormwater as critical factors in shaping a safer, more livable, and more economically vibrant region. The vision addresses three basic issues in Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard\nParishes: flooding caused by heavy rainfall, subsidence\ncaused by the pumping of stormwater, and wasted\nwater assets.\nONGOING ACTION\nONGOING ACTION\nNew Stormwater\nRegulations in\nComprehensive Zoning\nOrdinance\nLead: City of New Orleans\nLaunched: 2015\nRevisions to the Comprehensive\nZoning Ordinance now require the\nmitigation of runoff associated with new development or reconstruction, using on-site water catchment\ntechniques to slow surface flow\nand, in turn, reduce subsidence\nrates throughout the city. These\nnew regulations are an important\nstep in affecting change in land use development throughout our city.\nGreen Infrastructure Demonstration Projects\nLead: New Orleans Redevelopment Authority,\nSewerage & Water Board of New Orleans\nPartner: Louisiana State Office of Community Development\nLaunched: 2014\nThe New Orleans Redevelopment Authority (NORA) and Sewerage\n& Water Board of New Orleans (SWBNO) are building a series of\ngreen infrastructure demonstration projects to show the public\nhow underutilized spaces can be developed to detain stormwater\nand designed to make neighborhoods more attractive. NORA is\ntransforming vacant lots into rain gardens that draw runoff from\nthe street, store it temporarily, and capture many of the pollutants it\ncarries. SWBNO is funding innovative green infrastructure solutions\nsuch as green roofs, bioswales, and pervious pavement. These projects show us what is possible and how infrastructure can not only protect us but also beautify our communities.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS ADAPT TO THRIVE\nIncentivize property owners to invest in risk reduction\nFEATURED ACTION\nEstablish resilience retrofit program\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartner: Deutsche Bank\u2014AllianceNRG\nASPIRATION\nHouseholds and business owners have access to the resources, capacity, and expertise required to adapt to their\nchanging environment and future\nthreats.\nRain gardens and home elevations, seen here in the Lower Ninth Ward, are examples of ways homeowners can invest in risk reduction.\n\u25ba RESILIENCE VALUE\nBy investing in their own resilience,\nhouseholds and business owners will\ncreate readiness at the community\nlevel that will spur economic\ndevelopment, lower individual liability, and reduce the burden on public funds for disaster recovery.\nNew Orleans will develop a resilience retrofit program to provide incentives for property owners to reduce their own risk. The City is exploring the use of innovative financial instruments to launch the program, including the Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program. PACE is a voluntary program in which property owners can make energy efficiency improvements at little or no upfront cost, with loans repaid through property tax bills for up to 20 years. Low-interest\ncapital and a potential reduction in insurance premiums will serve\nas incentives to property owners to invest in storm resilience improvements such as elevation, floodproofing, storm shutters, and stormwater management features.\nSUPPORTING ACTION\nONGOING ACTION\nDevelop standards for\nresilient design\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: American Institute of Architects US Green Building Council\nClear guidance on risk reduction\nmeasures in the urban development of New Orleans is critical. Specific design and performance standards will be developed for residential and commercial structures, as well as the public realm.\nCommunity-based\nGreen Infrastructure and Capacity Building\nLead: Water Wise NOLA\nLaunched: 2014\nWater Wise NOLA is a group of community and professional\npartners working to advance green infrastructure in Greater\nNew Orleans and strengthen public awareness of water-related\nissues. Water Wise NOLA promotes simple solutions to the\nproblem of localized flooding, organizing workshops for\nhomeowners, neighborhood organizations, and key professionals.\nCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\nCritical infrastructure in New Orleans is more than just levees, bridges, and canals. It is a complex series of interdependent built and natural systems that keep our coastal city safe, productive, and healthy. Part of a resilient approach to infrastructure is an accurate understanding of the full geographic and functional breadth of these systems and the connection between our built urban environment and the managed landscapes that surround us.\nShocks like hurricanes have cascading effects on the city's critical infrastructure systems. When one\nsystem is compromised, it negatively impacts the function of other critical systems. For example, a\npower outage during a storm may compromise the function of the energy-intensive pumping stations, resulting in severe street flooding. We recognize the interdependence of these systems and are committed to their comprehensive management and adaptation to future conditions.\nInfrastructure\u2014such as reliable and affordable transportation and communication networks\u2014is not just critical for protection against shocks, but also for supporting economic growth and stability, providing reliable service delivery, and enabling equitable access to opportunity for all New Orleanians.\nCreate a culture of environmental awareness at every stage of life\nFEATURED ACTION\nDevelop knowledge and capacity of emerging environmental stewards\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: Louisiana Children's Museum,\nRipple Effect, Evacuteer\n'\tCredit: LCM, Mithun\nThe future Louisiana Children's Museum campus in City Park, focused on water education.\nASPIRATION\nThe next generation of New Orleanians has an accurate understanding of our physical environment and the risks we face, and has developed the capacity to prepare for and adapt to those risks.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nBy equipping our youth with the knowledge and understanding of local hydrologic and geographic conditions and processes, we develop leaders for today and tomorrow for adapting to our changing natural environment.\nWe will actively facilitate connections that prioritize the development of environmental stewardship and disaster readiness in our region's students. The City will partner with organizations already serving as hubs for experiential learning about the environment and preparedness and support content development with the best information available about our changing environment. Going beyond the inclusion of geography as a curriculum element, we seek expand to opportunities to experience the power of water and our environment across in-classroom subjects and in the wider city-as-laboratory.\nFor example, Ripple Effect partners with teachers, designers, and water experts to rethink in-school science education. Around the city, students engage in site-specific design challenges that also meet national science standards.\nWe recognize the need for physical sites outside of schools for students and educators alike to interact and learn about how we live with water. As an example, the Louisiana Children's Museum is committed to being a space for environmental education and experiences for children and adults\u2014with a focus on all the ways we live with water in coastal Louisiana.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS ADAPT TO THRIVE\nCreate a culture of environmental awareness at every stage of life\nThe Building Centre in London\nFEATURED ACTION\nEstablish resilience center\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: Rockefeller Foundation; Tulane University; GNO, Inc;\n100 Resilient Cities\nASPIRATION\nNew Orleans is a global leader in\nurban resilience, with the facilities and resources to share our experiences while continuing to learn from the daily realities of a complex urban condition.\n\u25ba RESILIENCE VALUE\nBy fortifying our neighborhoods\nand practitioners with leadership\nin resilience thinking and practice,\nwe can empower New Orleanians\nto recognize complexity and make\nwell-informed decisions.\nThe City and its partners will establish the Center for Resilience to\nsupport the outreach and capacity building functions of the Office of\nResilience and Sustainability. Since many of the steps that are required to make our city more resilient require the action of individuals, community-based organizations, and business owners, the Center for Resilience will provide a space and programming to build awareness and expertise, to develop projects and partnerships, and to exchange ideas and practices both locally and globally.\nCommunity outreach programming will offer an opportunity for global theories to meet local realities, advancing the public's understanding of New Orleans' challenges and connecting resilience concepts to\nour everyday lives. Leadership development programs will integrate\nresilience-driven thinking into the curricula of local leadership\nprograms. Training and professional education will enable public\nand private sector practitioners to improve their technical skills and\ngain knowledge in best practices. The Center for Resilience will also\nhost visitors, showcase the work New Orleans is conducting to build\nresilience, and export throughout the world the knowledge and\nexpertise our city has developed.\nSUPPORTING ACTION\nCreate leadership development program for city resilience Lead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: Neighborhood Partnership Network of New Orleans; GNO, Inc; New Orleans Regional Leadership Institute; CBNO\/ MAC Bryan Bell Leadership Forum; Tulane University Disaster Resilience Leadership Academy\nIn order to prepare for and respond to future shocks and stresses, we must create and foster leadership within our communities and public agencies to spur, inspire, and\nencourage concepts of resilience on a daily basis among friends, family, and neighbors. In collaboration with community partners, the City will coordinate a resilience leadership curriculum, customized to local New Orleans organizations, culture, and challenges. This leadership program will empower local networks of community and civic leaders to effectively prepare for and respond to future disasters in their neighborhoods.\nSUPPORTING ACTION\nLaunch Coastal New Orleans public awareness campaign Lead: City of New Orleans\nBefore we can be prepared to incorporate resilience practices into our communities and businesses, we must first understand the urgency of environmental issues and why it is important to act today. The City will partner with other public and private organizations to develop a multimedia campaign to highlight the coastal conditions and processes that created our city, sustain it today, and threaten its existence. We will focus on our geography as a coastal delta city, the unique natural challenges that we face, and how we can all be environmental stewards.\nCommit to mitigating our climate impact\nFEATURED ACTION\nDesign and\nimplement climate action plan\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: C40, Urban Sustainability Directors Network\nASPIRATION\nAs a global community, we are\nslowing the pace of human-generated climate change.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nBy joining the international community of cities committed to reducing their contribution to global climate change, we are also benefiting our local community through improved air quality and increased resource efficiency.\nNew Orleans is arguably more affected by climate change than any\nother US city, and while we are committed to adapting to our changing environment, we also share a responsibility to mitigate our impacts on climate change. New Orleans will join the growing international movement that seeks to limit our collective contribution to global climate change. We will set aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2050 and implement a plan to achieve them.\nWe will begin by determining our baseline emission levels, and then we will identify specific strategies to reduce them. The plan will set forth multiple strategies for reducing our climate impact, including transit improvements, land use policy changes, investments in alternative\nenergy and energy efficiency, and greening and conservation projects. We will then monitor our progress against measureable goals. The climate action plan will augment our climate adaptation measures already underway. Many of our climate adaptation strategies, such as wetland restoration, green infrastructure, and transportation\nimprovements, will also have mitigation benefits.\n\nCHALLENGE IN CONTEXT\nLouistanaisEhe\nthrdEarges&Eroducer\nfRgirEieumEndEhe\nsecond-largest producer\nof natural gas in the US.\nEVgryEgaEEEDSianSuiEiidfi&EhSESwiihmoreEiiEnsEasEhanwsiDuEEHuEmEauEEAEabisi TheEXiEaCiiSnEff&SSiUfUeiSBfiSEefinESitiCSlESEUEEBgl&n'SEfi&QESyfSEESSEaEuEfiQESEEi TQouEanESEfEBUiEianafamiiiESEeiyEnj&bsmEheEiiEnBEasin&uEiSEBBSEEBSEieSfiingEi' gbUBEaSEDaEUEaDEE\u00a3SSICBSEsnfil\u00a33E\u00a7HEUEE\u00a7iEeSHEfi3EUEanESEfmiie\u00a7EfEiE\u00a7ineSE&E\nthrough our marshes, exacerbating coastal land loss, and fossil fuels are the primary producers\n5fHmaESEhange-inEECiSgEEeG&hES\u00a3\u00a7Ea\u00a3fi\u00a3iHEEEEgiEn,W\u00a7EaZ\u00a7E\u00a7\u00a3nEiEBI&Ehi!\u00a3ESE\nconsumpiion and our economic drivers away from iradiiional energy sources like oil and gas and ioward adopiing large-scale renewable energyi\nMAP\nOffshore oil and gas infrasiruciure\npipeline\nplaiform\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS CONNECT TO OPPORTUNITY\nIntroduction\nBy investing in equity, we are investing in\nresilience. Equity will be the driving force\nbehind our economy's growth and innovation,\nour communities' safety and stability, and our\nfamilies' health and prosperity.\nNew Orleans' economic recovery and growth in recent years has been remarkable. Despite the enormous\nimpacts from the floods of 2005, the global financial crisis, and the BP oil spill, New Orleans has continued to recover\nits population, add jobs, and keep overall unemployment lower than most cities around the country. Furthermore, new businesses are forming at a rate\nwell above the national average, and New Orleans has been recognized nationally as a top location to start and grow a business. But this revitalization has not benefited everyone and in many cases has even furthered inequity.\nWhile the majority of New Orleanians are African American, most low-income households and people of color have not shared in the recent economic growth and prosperity. Wages have declined\nwhen adjusted for inflation. Income inequality has grown. Joblessness\nexceeds 50 percent among African-\nAmerican men. Minority-owned\nbusinesses compose 27 percent of\ntotal firms in metro New Orleans but\nreceive just 2 percent of total business\nreceipts. The effects of workforce\ninequality extend beyond the worker\nor job seeker. Today in New Orleans,\n39 percent of children and 27 percent of all New Orleanians are living below the poverty line. Wide disparities in public health outcomes exist, including higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, and\ncancer, and lower life expectancies for\nAfrican-American residents compared to white residents.\nWe are actively working to address\nthese inequities with a comprehensive\nset of projects and initiatives that\nreduce violence, build healthy and\nstable communities, connect workers\nto opportunities, and increase wages\nand improve livelihoods. However, even\nas we look to build equity in the future,\nwe cannot ignore past injustices and\nour city's legacy of inequity. Racial and\neconomic inequity is present in every\nfacet of our society and threatens our\nresilience as a city. We must meaningfully address this challenging reality and its effects in our systems, our institutions, and our communities.\nThe Opportunity of Growing Industries\nSoutheast Louisiana is fast emerging as a leader in the environmental services sector, but sustained growth and benefits to our local workforce and economy are not inevitable. We need to continue to foster local business growth and local hiring practices to create more local job opportunities and keep wealth in our communities. Greater New Orleans, Inc, the regional economic development alliance, is committed to further developing the emerging water and environmental services sector, with a goal of Southeast Louisiana becoming a global hub of businesses that profitably manage\nenvironmental issues and challenges. At the same time, the City\nof New Orleans is working to prepare the local workforce for the\ndynamic industries of the future city, especially as we embrace living with water.\nOur dynamic economy requires an\nadaptable workforce with the skills\nand training needed to pivot to new\nindustries. We witnessed the impacts of economic shifts when modernization in the shipping industry and an economic downturn in the petroleum industry\nleft generations of workers behind.\nWe have to prepare today's workforce\nfor emerging industries and connect\nNew Orleanians to the opportunities of\nthe 21st century.\nAccess to opportunity comes in many\ndifferent forms. It means providing\nsector-specific technical training and\n\u201csoft skills\u201d development. It also means\npartnering with our anchor institutions\nand emerging industries to change hiring practices and strengthen employment opportunities for local job seekers and small businesses. Reliable and affordable childcare, physical and behavioral\nhealth care, and transportation are also\nfundamental to connecting potential\nworkers to employment.\nWe are working to increase household and family stability since it directly influences our ability to succeed. Trauma and severe stress interfere with learning. Housing\ninstability and poor health threaten careers and frequently result in debt. Incarceration often leads to further crime rather than to rehabilitation. Hopelessness can be more\nharmful than a hurricane.\nBy investing in the safety, stability,\nhealth, and housing of our communities,\nNew Orleans can create connections to\nopportunity that did not exist previously.\nThe economic growth that can be realized from investing in our people is an example of the Resilience Dividend. Just as we\nmust adapt our city to align with the\nenvironment, so too must we shift the\nlandscape of opportunity toward equity.\n\u201cThere can be no renewal of our relationship with nature without a renewal of humanity itself.\u201d\ngpope^rancis\nEncyclical Letter, Laudato si',\nOn Care for Our Common Home, 2015\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS CONNECT TO OPPORTUNITY\nInvest in household financial stability\nFEATURED ACTION\nCreate emergency savings account program\nLead: Foundation for Louisiana\nPartners: City of New Orleans, Micro Finance Opportunities\nASPIRATION\nHouseholds and business owners have\nthe resources, capacity, and expertise\nrequired to adapt and respond to future shocks and threats.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nBy increasing savings, households will\nhave greater financial stability and be\nbetter prepared to respond to shocks\nwhile growing our overall economy in\nan equitable way.\nBuilding on the model of the Individual Development Account, a\nsavings-matching program for low- and moderate-income earners to set aside funds for emergency uses will be launched. A lack of access to savings poses a threat to many New Orleanians in times of crisis.\nBy building savings for emergency purposes, New Orleanians will be\nbetter prepared to handle unexpected costs. The program will provide an entry point to banking for the many unbanked and under-banked individuals in New Orleans, making them less susceptible to predatory lending and costly financial products. The emergency accounts will be complemented by an effort to empower individuals and families to become more financially literate. Financial education efforts will focus on understanding credit, banking, and investment strategies.\nIncorporate living wage provision into\npublic contracts\nLead: City of New Orleans\nLaunch: 2015\nAfter raising the minimum wage for public employees in 2014, the City will continue to lead by example, extending living wage requirements to publicly issued contracts with private companies. By expanding the number of people in New Orleans and its region who are able to earn a wage that can support a family's needs, we succeed in creating a more resilient economy and population.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS CONNECT TO OPPORTUNITY\nLower barriers\nto workforce participation\nWe are building and connecting the future workforce to emerging\neconomic opportunities and social growth by preparing local residents with skills, education, support, and greater access to resources.\nFEATURED ACTION\nLaunch digital\ndivide innovation challenge\nLead: City of New Orleans Partner: CityMart\nASPIRATION\nAll New Orleanians have the\nopportunity to gain the skills, training, education, and support needed to fully participate in our economy,\nprosper, and reach their full potential.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nBy increasing digital participation,\nNew Orleans will be more\neconomically competitive, better\nprepared to respond to shocks,\nand more likely to reduce disparate\noutcomes in income, employment,\neducation, and health.\nThe City will launch a challenge to call for creative approaches to\nincreasing digital access, literacy, and participation throughout\nNew Orleans. This initiative will investigate who is lacking access\nand literacy and the best approaches to these challenges. The\nCity and its partner will help define the problem, carry out market\nresearch to understand what solutions exist, and engage a wide\nrange of experts and entrepreneurs who have developed successful\nstrategies elsewhere to craft strategies for New Orleans. Through the challenge, New Orleans will seek to increase digital participation in order to enhance residents' connection to educational and workforce opportunities, heighten awareness of emergencies, and make the city more economically competitive.\nONGOING ACTION\nThe Network for Economic Opportunity\nLead: City of New Orleans Launched: 2014\nPartners: Ford Foundation WK Kellogg Foundation, Living Cities,\nFoundation for Louisiana, Greater New Orleans Foundation\nThe Network for Economic Opportunity (the Network) focuses on connecting disadvantaged job seekers and\nbusinesses to opportunities.

Planned developments must now include affordable housing to pursue density bonuses, and a new downtown riverfront district requires affordable units in all new development.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS TRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS\nIntroduction\nWe are building a New Orleans for the\nfuture\u2014one that embraces change, prepares\nfor the risks of the future, and honors our\ntraditions. To achieve this vision, we must not\nonly adapt, we must transform.\nOur future city will be one in which we live with water, invest in opportunities, and prepare ourselves for whatever\nunforeseeable challenges we may face. In order for people to connect to the opportunities of the future, we need modern and efficient transportation options to get workers to jobs and\nstudents to school. In order to bounce back from future shocks, we must prepare our city, neighborhoods, and businesses. In order to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and join the global community in mitigating climate change, we must invest in renewable energy sources and design for greater efficiency.\nShocks threaten our existence and\ncomplicate our daily lives. Sometimes\nthey come in the form of a hurricane,\nwhile other times an electrical surge\ninterrupts our access to clean water.\nOur city has faced significant shocks\nover the past decade in the form of\ninfrastructure failures, floods, recessions, oil spills, and storms. While we cannot predict exactly what future challenges are ahead or when they may come, we can be certain we will face them. Planning and preparing for future shocks is critical. This means making sure small businesses have tools to open sooner after storms. It also means developing a plan in advance for how we will recover our critical\ninfrastructure, deliver social services,\nand rebuild our homes after a disaster.\nBy planning in advance of a major\nshock, we can accelerate the recovery\nprocess, make more efficient use of\nscarce resources, and reduce the overall\neconomic and social impact to the city.\nIn order to be a city that supports\nthe health, safety, and prosperity of\nits people, we need systems that are\nreliable\u2014both in times of crisis and in\nour daily lives. A comprehensive and\nefficient transit system is key to creating opportunities for social mobility. In order to be an equitable city, it is imperative\nthat we invest in a multimodal regional\ntransportation system that connects\npeople to jobs, education, services, and recreation.\nPart of reliability is an understanding of where redundancy is most appropriate\u2014 knowing where backups can ensure the continuity of our most critical services.\nBy creating redundancy in the electrical grid, we can reduce downtime at facilities like hospitals and pumping stations, thereby limiting the potentially devastating impact of electrical outages. By reducing the rate of increasing demand through energy efficiency measures and diversifying production sources through renewable energy, we can reduce our impact on the environment.\nDuring the past five years, the vast\nmajority of basic municipal services\nand structures have been updated or\ntransformed. Our work is not done. In\norder to be resilient, city government\ncannot simply provide basic public\nservices but must also make these\ndelivery systems flexible to future\nneeds, robust and redundant in the face of shocks, integrated across agencies and departments, and responsive\nto community concerns. The public\nand private sectors must incorporate\nresilience thinking into decision-making\nprocesses to ensure that investments are strategic, create multiple benefits, and have a view to the future.\nThrough better management,\ncoordination, and service delivery, we\ncan unlock value by improving daily life\nwhile also preparing the city as a whole\nfor future shocks. By modernizing our\noperational systems, we will better equip residents and businesses to evolve from consumers of public services to partners in addressing shared challenges.\nOur delta city is already defined by its\ndynamism, and our future will only be\nmore complex. We need to prepare now by building systems that are flexible enough to respond to changing demands and conditions. Transforming city\nsystems is about taking action today to\nbuild the city of tomorrow.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS TRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS\nRedesign our regional transit system to connect people, employment, and essential services\nFEATURED ACTION\nRedesign regional\ntransportation\nsystems\nLead: City of New Orleans,\nRegional Transit Authority\nPartners: Ride New Orleans, Bike Easy\nASPIRATION\nNew Orleans is a car-optional city\nwith an integrated, efficient, and\nreliable multimodal regional transit\nsystem, prioritizing connections\nto employment and focusing on\npedestrian and bicycle safety.\n\u25ba RESILIENCE VALUE\nBy investing in a robust world-class\ntransit system, we will be more\nequitable, be more economically\ncompetitive, reduce our environmental impact, and support growth.\nThe City will hire a Transportation Coordinator to facilitate a transit\nsystem redesign and implementation strategy to connect people,\nemployment, and services. The City will lead by example in promoting mass transit use by providing public employees with a pre-tax transit pass.\nThe City of New Orleans will work with the Regional Transit Authority (RTA), neighboring jurisdictions, local advocacy organizations, and national experts to develop a multimodal regional transit vision. We will work together to create a detailed road map to guide investment in service improvements and expansion today and in the future, with a view to developing a comprehensive regional network. Establishing critical linkages between regional economic development projects and employment centers, such as the UMC-VA Medical Center and Louis Armstrong International Airport, identifying potential bus rapid transit (BRT) corridors will help guide early planning efforts. Our\nfuture multimodal transit system will integrate bicycle and pedestrian networks, with a \u201cVision Zero\u201d goal of no pedestrian or bicycle fatalities on city streets.\nOur jobs are regional,\nbut our transit system is not\nNew Orleans was late to create a regional transit authority, doing so only in the late\n1970s and early 1980s, and the effort was curtailed from the outset by the decision by\nsurrounding parishes to withdraw from the Regional Transit Authority. While any efforts at regional transit floundered, the RTA operated an efficient and widespread system\u2014 primarily based on bus service\u2014that served the entire city with frequent and dependable routes until the eve of Katrina.\nHowever, since Katrina, New Orleans' transit system has only regained 45 percent of the level of bus service, and the operating budget for the RTA has been reduced by almost 40 percent. Service reductions have been worst in areas where transit is most critical:\nlow-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and areas where people lack access\nto personal vehicles.\nToday, the region is lacking a comprehensive regional vision for transit\nservice. Because of this, the city faces significant challenges in connecting\nresidents to jobs and services, attracting new residents, and remaining\ncompetitive for scarce federal transportation funding.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS TRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS\nPromote sustainability as a growth strategy\nFEATURED ACTION\nLaunch Downtown Energy Efficiency Challenge\nLead: Downtown Development District Partners: City of New Orleans, Entergy\nASPIRATION\nNew Orleans is a national leader\namong peer cities in reducing energy use and its related environmental impact.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nBy reducing energy use, New Orleans will reduce operating costs for businesses, reduce the city's impact on the environment, and promote the city as a leader in sustainability and climate adaptation.\nThe City will partner with the Downtown Development District (DDD) to launch a Downtown Energy Efficiency Challenge that will engage property owners, businesses, and employees in a one-year competition to reduce overall energy consumption in the New Orleans CBD. City Hall will lead by example by reducing its energy consumption, seeking renewable energy sources, and promoting good practices.\nONGOING ACTION\nCity of New Orleans Energy Efficiency and\nUsage Initiatives\nLead: City of New Orleans\nThe City has begun to reduce the energy consumption of public assets. Fifty-five public school buildings have been built or renovated to LEED silver standards. The city replaced 23,000 streetlights with new energy-efficient LED fixtures, leading to a significant cost savings. The city stands to save significantly more by increasing efficiency in other public facilities and introducing renewable sources of energy.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS TRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS\nImprove the redundancy and reliability of our energy infrastructure\nFEATURED ACTION\nLaunch microgrid pilot project\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: US Department of Energy, Sandia National Laboratories, Sewerage & Water Board of New Orleans, Entergy\nASPIRATION\nGreater New Orleans has a reliable\nand redundant energy production\nand distribution network that is able\nto meet and adapt to the increased\ndemands and risks of the 21st century.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nBy providing energy backup during\nshocks and outages for a variety of\nco-located critical infrastructures\n(e.g., pumping stations, hospitals,\ncommunications), we can support\nfaster disaster response and recovery, and avoid losses of life and property.\nThe City of New Orleans is assessing the risks of energy outages\nto critical infrastructure systems and conducting feasibility studies\nfor backup generation, or microgrids. Microgrids are small backup\nelectrical generation and distribution systems that can disconnect\nfrom the traditional grid to operate autonomously and help mitigate\nthe effects of outages. Microgrids can help strengthen grid resilience\nand support quicker system response and recovery. Microgrids also\nsupport a flexible and efficient electric grid by enabling the integration of renewable sources of energy. In addition, the use of local sources of energy helps reduce energy losses in transmission and distribution, further increasing efficiency of the electric delivery system.\nWe are highly dependent on the electrical grid, and a major outage\ncan have severe consequences. Reliable power is especially important\nfor infrastructure and critical facilities that support and protect public\nhealth and safety, including water and wastewater, police and fire,\nhospitals, and communications systems. Our city has multiple critical\nfunctions or services that are interdependent, such that a loss of power or energy to one facility or service will adversely affect other functions or operations. For example, loss of power to a water treatment plant for an extended period could reduce the ability to pump water, impacting not only public health, but also firefighting and water for industrial\nuses. Therefore, extended power outages can have cascading impacts or lead to a devastating chain of failures of critical services.\nSUPPORTING ACTION\nPartner with regional energy utility to\nadvance efficiency and renewable sources\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartner: Entergy\nThe City of New Orleans and its partners will promote creative policies, such as decoupling, which incentivizes the utility to reduce energy use, and of renewable portfolio standards,\nwhich require increased percentages renewable energy\nsources. By modernizing our approach to energy use and\ngeneration, we can reduce our environmental impact and\nlower our energy costs.\nVISIONS AND ACTIONS TRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS\nIntegrate resilience-driven decision making across public agencies\nFEATURED ACTION\nEstablish Mayor's\nOffice of Resilience and Sustainability\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: 100 Resilient Cities,\nUrban Sustainability Directors Network\nASPIRATION\nCity government evaluates investments, programs, and policies based on their ability to mitigate the impacts of future threats, to adapt the city to environmental change, and to take advantage of emerging opportunities.\n\u25ba RESILIENCE VALUE\nBy crafting policies and programs based on their potential to create multiple benefits, New Orleans can make itself safer, healthier, and more economically stable using existing resources.\nThe Mayor's Office of Resilience and Sustainability, led by the chief\nresilience officer, will facilitate the adoption of best practices and\ncapacity building throughout city government. The office will\ncoordinate across the region and organize its work across the three\npillars of the city's resilience strategy: Adapt to Thrive, Connect to\nOpportunity, and Transform City Systems. The Mayor's Office of\nResilience and Sustainability will integrate with the existing resilience initiatives at the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority (NORA) and be supported by the Office of Performance and Accountability (OPA) on metrics and monitoring.\nSUPPORTING ACTION\nLaunch City Resilience Index Lead: City of New Orleans Partner: Rockefeller Foundation\nThe City of New Orleans will pilot the City Resilience Index (CRI)\nto serve as a holistic framework for monitoring across sectors and scales. The CRI will be managed by the OPA. Ongoing updating and monitoring of CRI metrics will be part of the City's practice of resilience and play a critical role in measuring the ultimate impact of New Orleans' resilience building efforts.\nONGOING ACTION\nONGOING ACTION\nPerformance Management\nPrograms\nLead: City of New Orleans\nLaunched: 2010\nSince initiating its successful STAT programs\nin 2010, the New Orleans OPA has led a\ntransformation in the improvement, tracking,\nand reporting of public service delivery. Based\non successful models piloted in Baltimore\nand New York City, the STAT model enables\nNew Orleans city departments to set goals and\ntrack progress, creating a culture of transparency\nand accountability. New Orleans' STAT models are used for an array of issues, such as blight, crime, and quality of life, and have received recognition both locally and nationally for their successes.\nOPA will support the work of the Mayor's Office of Resilience and Sustainability through the collection and monitoring of data related to resilience-\nbuilding projects.\nOne Stop Shop for City Permits\nand Licenses\nLead: City of New Orleans\nLaunched: 2012\nThe One Stop Shop provides physical and online locations for\nstreamlined customer service for permits, licenses, and enforcement\ncases. The One Stop Shop eliminated confusing\nbureaucratic processes spread out over multiple\noffices and replaced them with straightforward\nprocedures at a customer-centered location where\nwait times have been slashed from hours to less than 20 minutes and construction permits are issued within days rather than weeks.\nIntegrated Asset Management\nLeads: City of New Orleans,\nSewerage & Water Board of New Orleans\nLaunched: 2014\nThrough an agreement between the City and the Sewerage & Water Board, public infrastructure management projects are coordinated from planning to design to construction. Subsurface utility maintenance and other projects are conducted in concert to minimize construction tasks and costs. The City is now exploring digital asset management systems to further improve performance, coordination, and public reporting.\nInvest in pre-disaster planning for post-disaster recovery\nFEATURED ACTION\nCreate pre-disaster plan for post-disaster recovery\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: iParametrics, Swiss Re\nASPIRATION\nThe City of New Orleans is prepared\nfor future disasters and ready to carry out an efficient, comprehensive, and equitable recovery while building\nadaptive capacity and providing\ncross-sectoral benefits.\nRESILIENCE VALUE\nBy planning for comprehensive disaster recovery in advance of a major shock, the city can accelerate the recovery\nprocess, make more efficient use of\nscarce resources, and reduce the overall economic impact of future shocks.\nThe City of New Orleans will develop a comprehensive plan for\npost-disaster recovery that incorporates critical infrastructure\nsystems, land use, housing, economic development, and public\nhealth services. The plan will also set forth a sustainable recovery\nmanagement framework to increase predictability and stability in\nthe use of resources and ensure a resilience-driven decision-making process.\nThe City of New Orleans has been a national leader in developing\ninnovative ways to utilize federal disaster funding, but a comprehensive financing strategy includes public, private, and insurance funding sources. The City of New Orleans is working to identify the most advanced insurance coverage models to reduce exposure in the face of risk, including parametric policies, risk pooling, and green infrastructure modeling.\nSUPPORTING ACTION\nONGOING ACTION\nImplement resilient infrastructure\nrecovery and risk transfer for\ncritical assets\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: Swiss Re, Veolia\nThe City of New Orleans will conduct a thorough\nrisk assessment of the city's critical infrastructure to determine the exposures and the associated costs of disasters in various scenarios. With this assessment, the City will be able to isolate systems that are\ncritical to continued livability of the city and have\ndeployable private market assets prepared to repair and improve the system immediately after an event. Through this process, New Orleans will be positioned to be the first city to pre-fund the disaster resilience of its critical infrastructure using private market\nassets. Catastrophic losses will be pre-funded\nthrough the transfer of the risk to the private\nmarket. This will decrease the chances of sustained\nimpairments to basic services and save the city and\nits residents substantial expense in the future while\nimproving the speed of recovery.\nCitywide Parcel and\nBuilding Survey\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartner: Esri\nIn order to assess risk and measure blight reduction, the City is developing a rapid method for surveying building conditions on every parcel in the city,\ncapturing photography using car-mounted cameras and engaging community members to evaluate each parcel. Outside of crises, the property condition data can be used to develop strategies for risk reduction, code enforcement, and reuse of vacant property.\nAfter a disaster, the imagery can be quickly collected and used to rapidly assess recovery needs and support services, such as mobile first aid clinics, food and water distribution, and temporary housing. During disaster recovery, a citywide property condition census conducted at regular intervals can provide crucial progress updates and be used to strategically deploy public services and case management. Having comprehensive pre-storm data can facilitate more efficient reimbursement from FEMA and private insurers.\nONGOING ACTION\nCity-Assisted Evacuation\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartner: Evacuteer\nIn order to develop and implement a comprehensive citywide evacuation\nstrategy for all residents, the City of New Orleans partnered with the non-profit organization Evacuteer to raise awareness and assist in New Orleans' public evacuation option, City-Assisted Evacuation (CAE). Evacuteer recruits, trains, and manages volunteers to assist during evacuations.\nFor purposes of CAE, 17 special staging areas for evacuation pickup were\nidentified and marked prominently with 14-foot-tall stainless steel sculptures.\nKnown as Evacuspots, they serve as meeting and pickup points during\nmandatory evacuations and exist as awareness-building public art. Evacuteer\nalso operates EvacuKids, a disaster-preparedness and hurricane education\nprogram for children, in order to build capacity and preparedness in New\nDevelop the preparedness of\nour businesses and neighborhoods\nFEATURED ACTION\nDevelop small\nbusiness\nresilience program\nLead: City of New Orleans\nPartners: New Orleans Redevelopment\nAuthority, New Orleans Business Alliance, UN-ISDR, Walmart Foundation\nASPIRATION\nBusinesses will have access to the\nresources, capacity, and expertise\nrequired to prepare and respond\neffectively to disasters and economic\ndownturns.\n\u25ba RESILIENCE VALUE\nBy investing in disaster preparedness,\nbusiness owners will lower their own\nrisk exposure, spur further economic\ndevelopment, and improve the continuity of critical services in times of disaster response and recovery.\nThe City and its partners will bring technical assistance to small\nbusinesses and help them develop disaster preparedness strategies.\nThis initiative will modify the existing United Nations Disaster Resilience Scorecard to apply to small- and medium-sized businesses on strategic corridors in New Orleans. Building off of the work of the City Planning Commission's Main Street Resilience Program, we will measure\nresilience readiness and prioritize actions for each corridor in short-,\nmedium-, and long-term time frames, then conduct an awareness and\ntraining program for each of the corridors. The initiative will enable\neach business owner to assess his or her preparedness, identify\nachievable improvements, and explore resources to support business\ncontinuity, increase energy and resource efficiency, and enhance\neconomic stability.\nSUPPORTING ACTION\nLaunch neighborhood resilience program\nLead: New Orleans Redevelopment Authority\nNORA will develop a program to provide technical assistance and planning\nsupport to neighborhoods to assess their resilience and devise strategies\nand projects that address their challenges and risks. By working together to\naddress their common risks, neighbors can build social cohesion, develop new solutions, and reduce their exposure to risk. The program will be piloted in select neighborhoods building off of community development work previously undertaken by the City and NORA.","ENTITIES":{"DATE":["2050","2009","1718","November 2014","2004","2016","1970s","10th anniversary","18th century","2005","2015","20th century","last decade","2014","Nearly 10 years ago","2013","August 25 , 2015","2018","2010","1980s","21st century","2012","August 29 , 2005","64"],"ORGANIZATION":["City of New Orleans Energy Efficiency","City of New Orleans","OPA","Greater New Orleans Housing Alliance Partners","LA Office of Community Development","Rockefeller Foundation The City of New Orleans","Individual Development Account","ONGOING ACTION New Orleans Community Health","Downtown Development District ( DDD","the Office of Neighborhood Engagement","City of New Orleans Partners : Sewerage & Water Board","Resilience","Tulane University Disaster Resilience Leadership Academy","St. Bernard Parishes","Inc","& EhSESwiihmoreEiiEnsEasEhanwsiDuEEHuEmEauEEAEabisi TheEXiEaCiiSnEff & SSiUfUeiSBfiSEefinESitiCSlESEUEEBgl & n'SEfi & QESyfSEESSEaEuEfiQESEEi TQouEanESEfEBUiEianafamiiiESEeiyEnj & bsmEheEiiEnBEasin & uEiSEBBSEEBSEieSfiingEi ' gbUBEaSEDaEUEaDEE\u00a3SSICBSEsnfil\u00a33E\u00a7HEUEE\u00a7iEeSHEfi3EUEanESEfmiie\u00a7EfEiE\u00a7ineSE & E","Affordable Housing Requirements","Greater New Orleans Foundation","National Disaster Resilience Competition","CONTEXT LouistanaisEhe thrdEarges & Eroducer","Resilience Dividend","Opportunity of Growing Industries","HousingNOLA","SUPPORTING ACTION Launch Integrated Housing Policy Leads : City of New Orleans Partners","delta","CAE","Economy & Society","NORA The Integrated Housing Policy","Louisiana State Office of Community Development","Veolia The City of New Orleans","New Orleans Redevelopment Authority ( NORA","FEMA","UMC-VA Medical Center","FEMA Hazard Mitigation","Gulf Coast","Downtown Development District Partners","Rockefeller Foundation","Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance","Ripple Effect","City","Transportation Coordinator","Entergy ASPIRATION Greater New Orleans","Greater New Orleans Community Health Connection","Water Wise NOLA","Center for Resilience","Regional Transit Authority Partners","BRT","Urban Sustainability Directors Network ASPIRATION","Federal Emergency Management Agency","Deltares ;

Through four centuries we have withstood disruptions,\nweathered storms, and survived wars and pandemics. Time and time again, we have come back stronger.\nToday our city is home to the largest naval station in the world, the third largest port on the East Coast, and NATO's Allied Command. Norfolk is a historic tourist destination and the urban core of Hampton Roads \u2014the commercial, cultural, and educational hub for a region of 1.7 million residents.\nOur evolutionary success comes from the people who make Norfolk home. We are and have always been a city of makers and doers, people and organizations who work together to help Norfolk survive, adapt, and grow, no matter the environmental, economic, and social stresses and shocks we experience. Resilience is in our DNA!\nWe take great pride in the world's recognition of our resilient reputation with the designation of\nNorfolk as one of the first resilient cities in The 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) network, a program\npioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation. We are humbled to be part of this international group,\nwhich includes Paris, Milan, Rio de Janeiro, Lisbon, Melbourne, Glasgow, Sydney, Barcelona, Rome,\nMontreal, San Francisco, and other world-class cities. It's more than an honor; it's an amazing\nopportunity to connect with global experts and innovators. Through this international initiative, cities are identifying, sharing, and institutionalizing innovative resilience practices that will ultimately inspire and support thousands of cities around the world.\nAs a member of 100RC, we have developed our own resilience strategy to address the three major challenges facing our city today: sea level rise and recurrent flooding; a shifting economy; and a need to build strong, healthy neighborhoods.\nThis document presents the initial direction of our city's resilience strategy. First and foremost, our\nstrategy formally honors Norfolk's catalytic resilience leaders who have spearheaded much of the\nimportant work already underway. Throughout the document, we recognize many of our citizens as\nResilient City Builders for their individual and organizational work connecting, sharing, and building\nNorfolk's resilience capacity.\nSecond, our strategy makes connections between people, places, ideas, and systems. For example,\nsolutions to flooding can positively drive economic activity; innovative water management practices\ncan be used to reconnect neighborhoods and drive economic vitality; and networks designed to\nensure citizen safety during disruptive events can build neighborhood cohesion when the skies are\nblue. In short, our strategy views the city's challenges as opportunities to change in resilient ways.\nThird, our strategy begins the process of formally identifying and articulating the values, processes,\nand common language that will enable and inspire more people and organizations to engage and\nparticipate in building a more resilient Norfolk.\nThe challenges ahead call for more people and organizations to join our resilience efforts. By working together as a community, leveraging expertise and resources available through 100RC, and creating a formal and intentional resilience plan, we will continue to thrive at sea level.\nPlease join us as we show the world why Norfolk has been and will always be America's most\ndynamic and authentic urban waterfront community.\nSincerely,\nPaul D. Fraim Mayor\nThe launch of Norfolk's resilience strategy marks an important milestone: a year of research,\nstakeholder engagement, community outreach, and thoughtful planning. This hard work has now\nculminated in this impressive document, detailing the strategic goals, integrated solutions, creative\npartnerships, and action steps that will ensure Norfolk's resilience strategy has a positive impact on the city for generations to come.\nThrough Norfolk's resilience strategy, the city is embracing its challenges head-on: sea level rise\nand recurrent flooding; a shifting economy; and a need to build strong, healthy neighborhoods. It\nis identifying, orienting, and leveraging a variety of existing and new public and private partners to\ntackle these challenges. This not only includes incorporating the resilience work already in motion,\nbut also enhancing the resilience benefits of these efforts. It also includes identifying and cultivating\nnew collaborative efforts that build on the city's history of innovation and reinvention. Ultimately, all of this work will make Norfolk more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges of the twenty-first century, while also making the city better in good times for all of its citizens and visitors.\nThe creation of Norfolk's formal resilience strategy has helped raise awareness around the\nHampton Roads region of the overall practice and value of city resilience planning. This, in turn, has\nreinforced Norfolk's regional leadership role. Norfolk's resilience planning has also put the city at\nthe cutting edge of urban innovation nationwide\u2014which is especially important as Norfolk plays\nsuch a major role in the nation's economy and national security. Norfolk's resilience work is having\nan impact far beyond America, too. Norfolk was one of the first members of 100 Resilient Cities\n(100RC), and has been helping us build a global practice ever since. In addition to cities, the practice of resilience planning is also being embraced worldwide by the private sector, national governments, and non-governmental organizations.\nAll of this is why the launch of Norfolk's resilience strategy is so exciting for both Norfolk and\n100RC. We are looking forward to continuing our close partnership with Norfolk as the city begins implementing its resilience strategy. While only time will tell how much of an impact our partnership will make locally and globally, the one thing we now know for certain is that we couldn't have\nasked for a better start, more thoughtful local leaders, or a more engaged community to begin this important work.\nThank you Norfolk!\nSincerely,\nMichael Berkowitz\nPresident, 100 Resilient Cities\nIntroduction\nThe City of Norfolk has been a resilient\ncity for over 400 years. So we take great\npride in recently being selected as one of\nthe first members of 100 Resilient Cities\n(100RC), a program pioneered by The\nRockefeller Foundation. We are humbled\nto be part of this international group that\nincludes Paris, Milan, Rio de Janeiro, Lisbon, Melbourne, Glasgow, Sydney, Barcelona, Rome, Montreal, San Francisco, and other world-class cities.\n100RC is dedicated to helping cities\naround the world become more resilient\nto the physical, social and economic\nchallenges that are a growing part of\nthe 21st century by partnering directly\nwith member cities to understand their\nresilience challenges and collaboratively\nbuild solutions.\n100RC supports the adoption and\nincorporation of a view of resilience that\nincludes not just the shocks\u2014earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.\u2014but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis. Examples of these stresses\ninclude high unemployment; an overtaxed or inefficient public transportation system; endemic violence; or chronic food and\nwater shortages. By addressing both the\nshocks and the stresses, a city becomes\nmore able to respond to adverse events,\nand improves its ability to deliver basic\nfunctions to all populations in both good\ntimes and bad.\n100RC's vision is not only to help\nindividual member cities become more\nresilient, but also facilitate the building of a global practice of urban resilience among governments, NGOs, the private sector, and individual citizens. To advance that goal, 100RC provides several types of support: funding for a Chief Resilience Officer\nin each member city to lead resilience\nefforts; resources and technical assistance\nto develop a robust resilience strategy;\nmembership in a global network of peer\ncities to share best practices and build the field; and access to a variety of resilience\ntools, services and expertise through a\nseries of Platform Partners.\nThis document presents Norfolk's\nResilience Strategy, which codifies our\ncommitment to how we face and respond to our current and future challenges.\nOur resilience strategy centers on the\nability of individuals, systems, and our\nneighborhoods to survive, adapt, and,\nwhen conditions require it, transform\nin the face of shocks and stresses. At\nits core, our resilience strategy is a\ncommitment by each citizen, organization, and municipal system, and by leadership from all sectors, to acknowledge our\nstresses and vulnerabilities and to work\nproactively to find solutions. Our collective goal is not only to reduce risks, but also to innovate and transform our city in a systemic and holistic way, embracing new ways of thinking and managing and thriving amid conditions that require continuous innovation.\nIt is our hope that this document serves as more than a record of Norfolk's resilience strategy, but rather as a call to action.\nTo this end, throughout this document,\nwe showcase the real power behind\nNorfolk's resilience: the doers and makers who call Norfolk home. We hold up these individuals \u2014 our Resilient City Builders \u2014 as our inspirational examples of what\nNorfolk is all about.\nOver the next year, we will periodically\nidentify and profile a growing number of\nResilient City Builders, each time reminding us of our 400-year history of resilience and that Norfolk's future is what we make it. We encourage you to nominate anyone you believe is one of Norfolk's Resilient City Builders (the nomination form is on our website, www.NFKresilientcity.org). Most importantly, we encourage you to join us in creating the new Norfolk, an international model of resilience for the next 400 years.\nMason Andrews, a resident of\nNorfolk's Ghent neighborhood and\nan associate professor of architecture at Hampton University, is building the city's resilience to flooding.\nMason is working collaboratively\nwith Chesterfield Heights Civic\nLeague President Cheryll Sumner,\nExecutive Director of Wetlands\nWatch Skip Stiles, and ODU\nAssociate Professor of Civil and\nEnvironmental Engineering Mujde\nErten-Unal to develop innovative\nwater management practices to\ncurtail flooding in the historic coastal neighborhood of Chesterfield Heights. Hampton University and ODU students designed ways for residents to work together to hold rain runoff in yards, planters, rain barrels, and streets, creating a system that, when implemented, will substantially reduce street flooding. This project was made possible by a close collaboration of engineers and architects across the region, and by generous funding from the Virginia Sea Grant.\nNorfolk: Past, Present, and Future\nNorfolk is a historic city on the water. For 400 years, the city has been a key part of America's\nhistory, commerce, and innovation. We are known for resilience \u2014 surviving wars, a plague,\nhurricanes, and social upheaval. Time and again, we have reinvented and rebuilt ourselves. This\nlegacy has resulted in a citizenry accustomed to change and resilient to stresses and shocks.\nWe recognize the challenges before us and are addressing them head-on with a conviction and\npassion that are unique to the people who make Norfolk home today.\nNorfolk was established in August 1682 after a British act in 1680 ordered the establishment of a fifty-acre port town in each Virginia county. The \u201cTowne of Lower Norfolk County\u201d was bounded on the east, west, and south by the\nElizabeth River and on the north by\nwhat is now City Hall Avenue. In 1736, Norfolk was granted \u201cborough\u201d status.\nIt grew steadily and had a population of 6,000 by 1775, the eve of the American Revolution.\nOver the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Norfolk's history was punctuated by challenging historical\nevents. However, these events alone\ndid not shape Norfolk; rather, the way\nin which the city bounced back from\nthese events created the Norfolk we\nknow today.\nOn January 1, 1776, British forces\nbombarded Norfolk from ships\nanchored offshore. Patriot factions\ncompleted the destruction so the\nBritish could not house their army in\nthe city. Only the walls of the Borough\nChurch (today's St. Paul's Episcopal)\nremained standing. Citizens returned,\nhowever, and began to rebuild. By 1800, Norfolk's population numbered 7,000\nRESILIENCE\nUrban resilience\nis the capacity\nof individuals,\ncommunities,\ninstitutions,\nbusinesses, and\nsystems within\na city to survive,\nadapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\n\u2014 the eighth largest town in America.\nThe 1807 attack on the USS frigate\nChesapeake by the HMS Leopard\noffshore was a contributing factor in\nPresident Thomas Jefferson's decision to ask Congress to declare war on Great Britain\u2014the War of 1812. The ensuing British Navigation Acts and Jefferson's Embargo Act closed the port and all\nbut crippled the local economy. But\nNorfolk rebounded; a gradual return\nto prosperity followed in subsequent\ndecades, eventually leading to Norfolk's incorporation as a city in 1845.\nIn 1855, one-third of Norfolk's\npopulation died during a yellow\nfever epidemic. Just seven years later,\nearly in the American Civil War, one\nof the most famous naval battles in\nhistory played out within view of the\ncity between the first two ironclad\nbattleships, the USS Monitor and CSS\nVirginia (formerly the USS Merrimac).\nTwo months later in May 1862, Norfolk was surrendered to Union forces and was under federal occupation for the remainder of the Civil War.\nDespite these grave challenges,\nNorfolk was able to bounce back.\nBy the turn of the century, Norfolk's\nborders were expanding and the city\nwas experiencing significant economic growth. In 1917, the grounds of the 1907 Jamestown Exposition became home to the U.S. Naval Operating Base, setting the stage for the city's current economic engine, Naval Station Norfolk. Two world wars more than doubled the city's population. This\npopulation growth, combined with infill development to support the industrial waterfront and a series of annexations that ended in 1959, defined Norfolk's current borders: 61.86 square miles\nwith 144 miles of waterfront that\nsurround and shape the city's identity.\nNorfolk Today\nToday, Norfolk is an international city and the hub of the Hampton Roads region. Norfolk is the home to Naval Station\nNorfolk, the largest naval complex in the world, which supports the readiness of the Navy's U.S. Atlantic fleet and drives the economy of Norfolk and the region. Norfolk is also home to the Port of\nVirginia's Norfolk International Terminals, one of the city's and the region's most significant economic assets, which makes Norfolk an integral node in national and global trade.\nThese two stalwart industries provide\nthe foundation for the region's economy.\nDepartment of Defense spending\nsupports 40 percent of total regional\nemployment. Over 8,000 service members transition out of the military annually in the Hampton Roads region, providing the city with a highly skilled labor force. In addition, the Port of Virginia handles over 81 million tons of cargo, generates $60 billion of\neconomic activity annually, and provides\nemployment in port-related industries for 343,000 Virginians.\nOverreliance on these sectors, though,\nposes risks to today's economy. Military\njobs in Norfolk decreased approximately 25 percent between 2001 and 2014, sending ripple effects through the city's economy and driving the city toward an overall job loss of 11 percent during that time period. While the Port of Virginia is projected to grow, the city has not maximized its position near the port to cultivate an export economy in the city.\nSlow growth in other sectors has made it difficult for the city to rebound from significant military job loss and the\nrecent recession. According to the\nBrookings Institution, economic\nrecovery in the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-\nNewport News metropolitan statistical area ranked 281 of 300 metropolitan areas nationwide. Further, sectors in the city that are seeing job growth tend to\nhave lower wages than sectors that are\ndeclining.\nIn addition, the city faces unique fiscal,\ncapital, and land availability challenges.\nOver 5,000 of the city's 73,000+\nparcels are non-taxable due to the large presence of government and nonprofit institutions, which limits the city's ability to raise needed revenue. Further, over 90 percent of the city is built, making\nit difficult to expand existing or locate\nnew large businesses. Finally, while\nthe city's entrepreneurship sector is\ngrowing, venture capital investment, a\nkey component of an entrepreneurial\nsystem, remains low. In 2014, the region\nwas ranked 88th out of 89 regions in the total value of venture capital invested.\nAt the same time, the city presents several key characteristics that position it well for economic growth and diversification, including:\n\u2022 Strength in other sectors: While the port and military are large anchor institutions and will continue to provide a foundation for the city's economy, Norfolk is a leader in health care, education, finance, and information technology within the region.\n\u2022 Role as the region's urban job center: With 191,212 jobs, Norfolk is the region's job center. And with 3,533 jobs per square mile, Norfolk also has the highest job density in\nthe region. The city provides urban assets by serving as the region's downtown commercial core and by supplying its only rail transit system, the Tide, to support residents and employees.\n\u2022 Concentration of high-wage jobs: Norfolk's status as a hub for industries, like professional services and finance, is reflected in an average wage of $50,926\u2014 higher than the Hampton Roads region and slightly higher than the Commonwealth and the nation.\n\u2022 Presence of educational institutions: Norfolk has a foundation of higher education institutions that can support a\nworkforce development pipeline. Old Dominion University, Norfolk State University, Eastern Virginia\nMedical School, Virginia Wesleyan College, and Tidewater Community College provide a diverse set of\nprograms that can equip Norfolk residents with the skills they need to engage in growing and emerging industries. The institutions are also conducting research that has the potential to spur new economic growth, particularly if the pipeline between academia and industry is strengthened.\n\u2022 Emergence of an entrepreneurial economy: Norfolk is a city that works. While indicators like venture capital investment remain low, the city's reputation for entrepreneurial activity is growing. Local residents and entrepreneurs see momentum in the entrepreneurial economy, and Entrepreneur magazine recently named Norfolk one of the top five U.S. markets for startups. This spirit of hard work is evident throughout the city, as residents, businesses, and military personnel and their families revitalize old spaces, create new\nbusinesses, and infuse energy into emerging industries.\nNorfolk is not only a city that works, but also a city of neighborhoods. Norfolk is made up of more than 120 distinct communities with vibrant character and high degrees of citizen engagement. Our citizens live on the beach and along the hundreds of inlets and waterways \u2014 and more and more, they also live downtown on the waterfront and in the Arts District. The diversity of neighborhoods in this urban core distinguishes Norfolk from many other cities along the East Coast.\nToday Norfolk's population is over 245,000\nin a region of 1.7 million people. Norfolk is\nthe second largest city in the Commonwealth and serves as the region's urban center with the highest population density in the region (4,548 people per square mile). Norfolk's\npopulation diversity sets the city apart\nfrom the region, the Commonwealth, and\nthe nation. This diversity is recognized and\ncelebrated by its citizens. When asked in\nlocal surveys what distinguishes Norfolk from other U.S. cities, respondents often identify Norfolk's diversity as one of the city's greatest advantages.\nWhile diversity is one of our city's most\ndistinguishing attributes, it is also one of our\ngreatest challenges. Poverty levels are highly\nconcentrated in some communities, and\nthe difference is even more significant by race and age.\nRelative to other cities in Hampton Roads,\nNorfolk has the highest level of income\ninequality. More than half of our residents\nhave low to moderate incomes, with 19.2\npercent living in poverty, and the city's median household income of $44,747 is lower than that of the region, state, and country. Nearly one-third of Norfolk's residents are highly\nrent-burdened, spending over 50 percent of\ntheir income on housing. The current social\nand economic stresses facing many residents pose critical challenges for the city.\nIt is imperative that every member of our diverse city have an acceptable standard of living and easy access to all the community's services and related advantages.\nNorfolk's greatest advantage is its access to water. Water has always been one of our most critical assets, as it drives our economy and enhances our quality of life. Few urban environments offer access to 144 miles of shoreline; water is our identity, and it differentiates us.\nNorfolk floods. The city has flooded throughout its history, but the severity and frequency of this flooding have increased significantly over the last decade. Several new trends are exacerbating these risks and forcing us to evolve the way we live with water, including:\n\u2022 Sea level rise and subsidence: Rising seas and localized land subsidence have led to Norfolk having the highest rate of relative\nsea level rise on the East Coast. While\nglobal sea levels have risen 5-8 inches over the last century, in Norfolk, the sea level has risen over 14 inches since 1930.\n\u2022\tMore frequent storms: Six out of the\neleven highest water levels that affected Norfolk since 1933 occurred in the last twelve years. Flooding risks will continue to increase. Nuisance tidal flooding in the city has increased by 325 percent since 1960 and the local sea level is projected to rise between 1.5 and 7.5 feet by the year 2100. With 25 percent of Norfolk's parcels already located in the 100-year floodplain, it's clear the city will need to plan differently for the future.\n\u2022\tIncreasing flood risk: While all residents\nof Norfolk are increasingly threatened by more frequent and more intense storms, as well as routine nuisance flooding, some of Norfolk's most socially and economically at-risk neighborhoods are disproportionately vulnerable to flooding and storms.\nRESILIENT CITY BUILDERS\nKaren Scherberger, CEO of Norfolk's Festevents, and Mary Miller, President and CEO of the Downtown Norfolk Council, joined forces to help the community capture the essence of Norfolk. Through their work establishing Norfolk's Collaboratory, Karen and Mary asked citizens to weigh in on what's important and unique about our city. Through this innovative crowdsourcing effort, residents identified specific attributes \u2014 our waterfront, our diverse population, our historic importance, our military, and our unique urban vibe \u2014 as characteristics that make Norfolk a great place to live. Now members of the Collaboratory are working together to highlight these important characteristics, telling the world what makes Norfolk great.\nAs our coastal risks continue to shift,\nwe face challenges in how to respond\nand plan for today and the future. With over 90 percent of our land built out with homes and businesses, there is little room to physically shift ourselves in traditional ways. Nor do we wish to retreat from the water; instead, we will find new ways to live with it.\nWhile changing natural, economic, and\nsocial environments are challenging, they are not impossible to address. In fact, these stresses present an opportunity for us to leverage our strengths and assets to build a stronger, more resilient Norfolk for the next 400 years.\nNorfolk's livelihood and economy will\nremain on the water. Because of this,\nNorfolk must adapt to the changing\nenvironment in new ways. Living and\nworking differently on the water allow\nus to think about new ways to harness the water \u2014 developing innovative industries and technologies, designing\nnew physical and open spaces, and\nengaging differently with each other\nto mitigate risks and strengthen\ncommunities.\nThe changing role of the military and\nother economic shifts require us to\nidentify new opportunities to grow\nour economic pie. With our strengths and emerging industries, we have an opportunity to pursue strategies that create living-wage jobs for all residents by building, retaining, and attracting a diverse set of vibrant businesses\nand by equipping Norfolk's residents\nwith the skills they will need for jobs\nin growing industries. Industries such\nas the maritime and medical clusters\nand entrepreneurial businesses can be catalysts for this inclusive growth.\nNorfolk's long-term resilience will\nbe based, in part, on decreasing high\nlevels and concentrations of poverty.\nNeighborhoods that have been\nphysically, economically, or socially\ndisconnected must be better connected to\nquality jobs, schools, transportation, healthy\nfood, parks and recreation, and other factors that improve quality of life and build strong, resilient communities. Expanding access\nto employment and services, creating\nneighborhoods of choice, and tackling\npoverty head-on require dedicated attention, more innovative and holistic solutions, and additional resources.\nBuilding the city of the future requires\nleveraging our opportunities and seeking\nadaptive, innovative strategies to embrace\nand overcome our challenges. Residents,\ncommunity groups, the private sector, and\ncity leaders must engage with each other\nto develop solutions that allow businesses\nto flourish and residents to safely live, work,\nand play in this globally important city. This\nstrategy also stands as an invitation to all\nresidents to engage in dialogue and action\nto ensure that all of Norfolk's residents,\nneighborhoods, and businesses can continue to thrive at sea level.\nMarty Kaszubowski has been working to build a support system for entrepreneurs for over a decade. His latest venture is Old Dominion University's Norfolk Innovation Center, opening on Boush Street in downtown Norfolk. The center connects new businesses to mentors, capital, learning, legal advice, marketing, and financial information. The goal is to help new businesses grow the region's economy. Marty believes connecting people to people, people to resources, and people\nto new ideas is the secret\nsauce for entrepreneurs.\nNORFOLK'S RESILIENCE STRATEGY:\nGuiding Tenets\nThe development of Norfolk's Resilience Strategy is based on eight core guiding tenets or values. We believe our resilience strategy must be:\n\u2022 Celebrating and building on existing work: We recognize, honor, and build on the important leaders and work already underway. The creation of our resilience strategy recognizes and seeks to elevate prior and current resilience building\ninitiatives, projects, and actions by the city, nonprofit organizations, and communities.\n\u2022 Aspirational: We take an approach that inspires other people and organizations across our community to engage and\nparticipate in the successful and continuous transformation of Norfolk into the most dynamic and authentic urban waterfront community in America.\n\u2022 Proactive, not reactive: We acknowledge and embrace change, risks, and challenges by being proactive. We commit to\ntransforming by viewing challenges as opportunities to reinvent ourselves.\n\u2022 Fair and equitable: We define the future by developing visions built on our current assets, equitably distributed throughout the city. Our work is neighborhood-focused\nto ensure that all citizens live in resilient communities.\n\u2022 Community-driven and connected:\nWe create a strategy with, not for the community. We connect and align people, places, and systems to create benefits across multiple systems. By intentionally connecting these systems through a\ncommunity-driven process, we believe we can have transformative impact and be an innovative leader in resilience.\n\u2022 Actionable and practical: We create change at the city, neighborhood, and resident scales. Some resilience initiatives deliver rapid change while others may take a generation or more to realize. Collectively we generate strategies and solutions that can have significant impact on the city in the near and long term.\n\u2022 Informed: We are informed by a growing body of data-driven and research-based plans and reports undertaken by the city and its partners. We will increase access to information for everyone to engage in informed decision-making for the future.\n\u2022 Long-lasting: We focus on the continuous transformation of Norfolk. While Norfolk has constantly evolved over the past\n400 years, the challenges ahead call for more residents and organizations to join the resilience cause in a more\ndeliberate manner.\nIn the pages that follow, you will\nlearn about our initial resilience\nstrategy development process,\nvision, and implementation\napproach, all of which are guided by these fundamental tenets of belief.\nThe resilience strategy process\nwas also guided by the 100RC\nCity Resilience Framework (CRF). The CRF, developed by Arup with support from The Rockefeller\nFoundation, is based on extensive\nresearch in and about city systems and is built on four essential dimensions of urban resilience: Health and Wellbeing, Economy and Society, Infrastructure and Environment, and Leadership and Strategy. Taken together, the CRF provides a new method for evaluating a city's strengths and weaknesses and a lens to understand the complexity of cities and the drivers that contribute to their resilience. The resilience team used this framework to assess Norfolk's challenges and opportunities and guide the strategies and actions included in this plan.\nEach of the four CRF dimensions\ncontains contains three \u201cdrivers,\u201d which reflect the actions cities can take to improve their resilience. The CRF also considers which key qualities resilient systems require to withstand, respond to, and adapt more readily to shocks and stresses. Extensive research has shown that resilient cities demonstrate seven qualities. Reflectiveness and resourcefulness reflect the ability to learn from the past and act in times of crisis. Robustness, redundancy, and flexibility are qualities that help to conceive systems and assets that can withstand shocks and stresses as well as build the willingness to use alternative strategies to facilitate rapid recovery. Inclusivity and integration reflect\nthe processes of good governance\nand effective leadership that ensure\ninvestments and actions are appropriate, address the needs of the most vulnerable, and collectively create a resilient city\u2014for everyone.\nNORFOLK'S RESILIENCE STRATEGY:\nPlanning Process\nWe began our journey by asking a\nsimple question: What most challenges\nour city's ability to thrive today and to\nbounce back from a disaster tomorrow? Through a six-month conversation with hundreds of community members \u2014 representing residents, nonprofits, educational institutions, the military, the business sector, the faith based community, and local government \u2014 a clear picture emerged. While\nincreasing frequency and intensity of\ncoastal storms and resultant flooding\nwas top-of-mind for almost every\nresident, issues impacting the city's\neconomic future, including those arising from concentrations of poverty, quickly dominated the discussion.\nTo provide leadership and insight during this process, a steering committee and working groups \u2014 composed of resident, business, nonprofit, and city staff stakeholders \u2014 met to review previous work, digest new information,\nand discuss ways to build resilience.\nAll team members brought individual\nexpertise to bear on the process, but\nthe cross-committee dialogue was\nmost critical in forming connections\nacross the city's strengths and identifying creative resilience opportunities. For example, the steering committee\nand working groups recognized that\nsolutions to flooding can positively\ndrive economic activity; that innovative\nwater management practices can be\nused to reconnect neighborhoods\nand drive economic vitality; and that\nnetworks designed to ensure citizen\nsafety during disruptive events can build neighborhood cohesion when the skies are blue. In short, they viewed the city's challenges as opportunities to change in resilient ways.\nThis collaborative diagnostic work was\ninformed by the array of initiatives and\nresearch already underway across the\ncity and by independent analysis and\nactivities designed specifically for this process.\nThe exciting new efforts included:\n\u2022 Conducting a baseline economic analysis that assessed current trends and identified challenges and opportunities for the city's future economic growth, including interviews with more than thirty organizations and an entrepreneurial and small business survey completed by over 130 local businesspeople.\n\u2022 Convening other cities in the 100RC network with land use experts from around the country to explore the next generation of resilient land use planning and to provide close consultation on Norfolk's specific land use challenges and opportunities.\n\u2022 Partnering with Sandia National Laboratories, a 100RC platform partner, to assess the potential economic impact of a storm\non Norfolk's key assets and the resultant economic impact on the nation.\n\u2022 Collaborating with local leaders to better understand social and economic issues across Norfolk's diverse neighborhoods and experiment with new technologies to find ways to help connect people in need.\n\u2022 Conducting comparative analysis and receiving technical support from other chief resilience officers and subject-matter experts around how global cities have used water\ninfrastructure to help connect and protect communities.\n\u2022 Developing a state-of-the-art Resilience Data Dashboard with the support of Palantir, another 100RC platform partner, to integrate key city data to improve the city's ability to\nunderstand risks, be more responsive to citizens, and make better decisions about the future.\nThis integrated approach led the city to identify\nthree key resilience goals, each with supporting\nstrategies and actions, which will help to bolster\nthe city's physical, economic, and social resilience moving forward.\nRESILIENT CITY BUILDERS\nJohn Stewart, leader of the\ngrassroots Lafayette Wetlands\nPartnership, has been working\nwith communities to build\nresilience one green space at a\ntime. Since 2007, John and his\nteam of exceptional volunteers have worked with residents to restore wetlands throughout the Lafayette River system. To date, the partnership has restored over 15,000 square feet of\nwetlands, creating a \u201cstring of\npearls\u201d along the river that\nprovides wildlife habitat, helps\nclean the water, and creates\ninviting places for people to\nvisit along the Lafayette River.\nNorfolk's resilience approach is driven by three key goals, each bolstered by supporting strategies and actions. Some actions represent new initiatives; others are already underway. All are a commitment to a new way of doing business \u2014 infused with our key tenets, they're collective and coordinated actions to build resilience.\nThe strategies and actions featured in this document are exhaustive of neither the efforts that have taken\nplace, nor those initiatives the city will pursue. This strategy seeks to set a marker at this point in time\nto acknowledge the extensive work that has been done and establish a framework and philosophy for\nhow Norfolk will collectively pursue our resilience-building efforts going forward. The strategic resilience\nframework is organized as follows:\nGOAL 1 Design the coastal community of the future.\nSTRATEGIES\n1.\tCollectively create a vision for the city's future.\n2.\tAccess, identify, and implement innovative infrastructure for water management.\n3.\tCreate a place where people want to live, work, and play.\n4.\tRedesign tools and regulations to achieve our vision for the future.\nGOAL 2\nGOAL 3\nCreate economic opportunity by advancing efforts to grow existing and new sectors.\nSTRATEGIES\n1.\tCreate a multi-pronged economic development strategy.\n2.\tNurture the city's entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n3.\tStrengthen the workforce development pipeline.\n4.\tReinvest in and revitalize neighborhoods.\n5.\tExplore innovative financing methods.\nAdvance initiatives to connect communities, deconcentrate poverty, and strengthen neighborhoods.\nSTRATEGIES\n1.\tImprove citizen access to information and services.\n2.\tSupport community-building efforts through technology.\n3.\tConnect the community through conversation.\nGOAL 1: Design the Coastal Community of the Future\nNorfolk's position as a coastal city is\nclosely connected to its history, culture,\nand economy. In the face of rising sea\nlevels, we are committed to continuing\nthe globally important work of ensuring trade moves seamlessly through our port, to supporting the readiness of the nation's naval forces, and to safeguarding our city's historic, cultural, and\nnatural assets. To achieve this goal we\nacknowledge that the city must physically change. We embrace the idea that this physical transformation can drive economic vitality and social cohesion.\nRecognizing our risk, we have worked\nover the past decades to evaluate\nand design infrastructure to protect\nNorfolk's edge. We have built seawalls,\nsophisticated dune systems, and other\ntypes of gray and green infrastructure\nto keep us safe and dry. But with sea-\nlevel rise and increased storm intensity,\nwe need to expand our thinking and\nour solutions and develop creative new infrastructure systems at both the edge and within the city. We need to think\ndifferently about how we build, how\nwe connect, and how we live with and\nembrace the water.\nAs we design and build a new kind of\ncoastal community to withstand changin threats, we are committed to reducing residents' exposure to risk, to building an economy driven by innovative\nsolutions, to leveraging infrastructure\ninvestments to create new open spaces for citizens, and to bringing communities together and attracting new residents\nto our city. Our efforts to design the\ncoastal community of the future can\ndemonstrate how coastal cities around\nthe world can learn to live, adapt, and\nthrive along the water.\nSTRATEGY 1: Collectively create a vision for the city's future.\nTo create the coastal community of the future, we will define our future through a collaborative visioning process. Building on PlaNorfolk 2030, the city's comprehensive planning effort, we are developing our vision for a resilient future through design-based dialogues.\nACTIONS\tLaunch Vision 2100, a citizen-led long-term\nplanning initiative.\nThe City of Norfolk's Planning and Neighborhood Development departments are collaborating to create Vision 2100, a citizen-led discussion to\nidentify what's important and what principles the city should use to guide future land use decisions. Vision 2100 is informed by the resilience thinking in this strategy; it will bring that thinking into\ncommunities, collectively map community assets, and facilitate discussions about where and how the city should make long-term investments for future growth.\nTimeline: November 2015 through March 2016.\nPartner with global experts to develop next-generation water management strategies.\nThe Royal Netherlands Embassy, Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, and the cities of Norfolk, Newport News, and Hampton jointly hosted the Virginia Dutch Dialogues in June 2015 to generate innovative ideas for living with water. For Norfolk, these innovations included using water management as a way to protect and\nrevitalize neighborhoods.\nTimeline: Drawing from ideas explored during the 2015 Virginia Dutch Dialogues, the City of Norfolk played a leadership role in developing a recent proposal submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for funds to build resilience to community threats, including flooding,\neconomic downturns, and concentrated poverty. Grant awards are scheduled for January 2016.\nResilience partners include:\nAmerican Institute of Architects\nARCADIS\nCity of Hampton\nCity of Newport News\nCity of Norfolk\nCommonwealth of Virginia\nElizabeth River Project\nEmerging Leaders Program\nHampton Roads ULI\nHampton University\nHR&A Advisors\nOld Dominion University\nRoyal Netherlands Embassy\nSlover Library Foundation\nWaggonner & Ball Architects\nWetlands Watch\nWork Program Architects\nSTRATEGY 2: Assess, identify, and implement innovative infrastructure for water management.\nDesigning the coastal community of the future requires water management approaches and infrastructure that respond to both current and future risk. Norfolk will pioneer both hard and soft infrastructure solutions and the creative funding models needed to implement these solutions.\nACTIONS\nInnovate to combine hard and natural systems to better control flooding.\nRE.invest, a Rockefeller Foundation partnership with re:focus partners, Bechtel, Wall Street Without Walls, and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP, provided new ideas for designing and financing hard and natural systems to control flooding. The group focused on integrated flood management solutions in the Arts District and explored solutions, such as cost-effective green i nfrastructure options and seawall upgrades, to address the frequent flooding challenges that limit economic development opportunities. The team also identified relevant legal and financial mechanisms to support public and private investments in the innovative solutions. Led by the city's departments of Public Works and Finance, this partnership is working to move these ideas to new practices. Timeline: The report was completed in 2014. The City of Norfolk is developing plans to implement the most promising innovations.\nEstablish a global practice on water innovation.\nIn October 2015, the 100RC cities of Norfolk, New Orleans, Bangkok,\nBerkeley, Surat, Mexico City, Vejle,\nRome, and Rotterdam convened in Rotterdam with global experts to provide peer critiques and explore how to achieve multi-benefits from flood mitigation efforts. Norfolk presented its innovative model of using water management to revitalize a low-income neighborhood, and the City of Rotterdam was used as a living lab to explore Dutch innovations, such as water plazas and underground storage facilities. Leveraging the power of the 100RC network and global partners, Norfolk will lead the creation of the next generation of innovative practices for managing and living with water.\nTimeline: Further network collaboration kicks off in November 2015 and will continue into 2016. We will synthesize these initial insights into recommendations for our local businesses, chamber of commerce, venture companies, and universities, and propose methods of capitalizing on emerging water management technologies by the end of 2016.\nGOAL 1: Design the Coastal Community of the Future\nExplore design ideas for the future.\nIn partnership with the University of\nPennsylvania School of Design and The\nRockefeller Foundation, Norfolk participated\nin a new initiative called the Structures of\nCoastal Resilience. The partnership produced\nnew data and design concepts for the future,\nincluding building \u201cfingers of high ground\u201d in\nthe Lafayette River watershed to create areas that can be developed even with expectant sea level rise. The new data and thinking\nare being integrated into Vision 2100 and\nother initiatives led by the city's Planning\nDepartment.\nTimeline: Initial findings were published in\n2015. In December 2015, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the City of Norfolk will host a charrette to further workshop design concepts and identify next steps.\nPartner with the U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers on a comprehensive flood risk study.\nWorking together, the City of Norfolk and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will conduct a comprehensive study of flooding in Norfolk. The study will evaluate options to reduce the city's flooding risk.\nTimeline: This will start in early 2016 and be\ncompleted in fall 2019. The city will integrate\nthis study's outcomes with other ongoing\nactions to advance strategies for better\nleveraging flood mitigation investments.\nResilience partners include:\n100 Resilient Cities network\nAkin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP Bechtel\nCity of Norfolk\nre:focus Partners\nTom McNeilan, a civil and\ngeotechnical engineer, loves\nNorfolk! Tom, a resident of\nFreemason, was instrumental\nin connecting the city with\nDale Morris from the Royal\nNetherlands Embassy and David\nWaggonner, a New Orleans-\nbased architect, and in bringing\nthe Virginia Dutch Dialogues'\n\u201cLife at Sea Level\u201d workshop to\nNorfolk. Through Tom's efforts,\nmore than thirty experts from\naround the world came to\nNorfolk in June to help our\ncitizens imagine what Norfolk\nwill look like as we embrace the\nwater. The resulting ideas are\nshaping solutions to flooding in\nthe city and building resilience by helping us learn to live with water.\nRockefeller Foundation\nUPenn School of Design\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wall Street Without Walls\nSTRATEGY 3: Create a place where people want to live, work, and play.\nNorfolk's coastal access is a strong foundation for attracting and retaining residents. In addition\nto protecting the coastline and downtown core through infrastructure investment, Norfolk must strengthen its identity as a vibrant, attractive place for residents and businesses alike.\nBrand the city.\nThe Downtown Norfolk Council\n(DNC), Festevents, and the City\nof Norfolk formed the Norfolk\nCollaboratory in 2013 to crowdsource\nNorfolk's brand messaging. Through\nthe Collaboratory, over 1,600 residents\nidentified the city's diversity, history, and waterfront environment as its key assets. City agencies and partners are now\nusing the Collaboratory's brand message architecture to more seamlessly advance Norfolk's brand. The Collaboratory\nrecently received an award of excellence from 3CMA for its work in engaging and empowering the community to help formulate Norfolk's messaging.\nTimeline: Ongoing implementation.\nThe DNC, Festevents, and other\norganizations that promote the city are\nusing the Collaboratory's brand message architecture to market the city with a unified voice.\nFocus on retaining talent.\nThe Greater Norfolk Corporation,\nthe DNC, and the City of Norfolk\nhave launched LiveNorfolk, a summer\nprogram that gives young people\ninterning at corporations and other\ninstitutions in Norfolk the chance\nto experience the quality of life that\nthe city has to offer. LiveNorfolk\nprovides city tours, Nauticus sailing,\nnetworking receptions, and professional\nVirginia Dutch Dialogues:\nWaggonner & Ball Architects Vision\nof Newton's Creek Watershed\nIn June 2015, the Royal Netherlands\nEmbassy sponsored the second-ever\nDutch Dialogues in the United States.\nBuilding on previous planning efforts,\nthe dialogues brought together Dutch\nurban designers, engineers, landscape\narchitects, planners, academics, and\ngovernment officials to work with\nAmerican counterparts to explore\ncreative solutions and holistic concepts\nto reduce flooding. During the\nworkshop, experts looked at improving infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and smart redevelopment. The outcome of the dialogues is an innovative water management solution that includes\nholding, absorbing, and filtering excess\nwater in yards, streets, and new\nretention areas. The strategy developed for Norfolk combines rain gardens, cisterns, living shorelines, marshes, streams, and berms to create a system that works together to manage sea level rise and precipitation flooding in the city.\nRESILIENT CITY BUILDERS\ndevelopment opportunities, among other\nevents, to highlight the benefits of living and\nworking in the city. Next year the program\nwill be extended to more companies and\norganizations.\nTimeline: Ongoing. LiveNorfolk began in\nsummer 2014 and will to continue in future\nsummers.\nEnliven commercial corridors with new local businesses.\nVibrant Spaces, sponsored by the DNC,\nprovides discounted retail space to startup\nbusinesses. The goal is to accelerate the\ncreation of neighborhood-defining businesses while activating street-level experience in the city's commercial corridors. Vibrant\nSpaces provides grants to energize street-\nlevel businesses' storefronts, improve signage, add outdoor seating, activate sidewalks and rooftops, and house a new business collaboration. New businesses that are selected through a competitive application process receive $20,000 and a 50 percent break on rent for two years.\nTimeline: Ongoing. Vibrant Spaces launched in summer 2015.\nResilience partners include:\nCity of Norfolk\nDowntown Norfolk Council\nFestevents\nGreater Norfolk Corporation\nGrow\nNauticus\nNorfolk Convention and Visitors Center Virginia Arts Festival Virginia Opera\nVirginia Stage Company Virginia Symphony\nDrew Ungvarsky believes in\nNorfolk's economic potential.\nOwner of Grow, a digital agency\nlocated on Granby Street, Drew\nis committed to making Norfolk\na great place for young talent to\nlive. Drew is spearheading the\nVibrant Spaces program for the\nDowntown Norfolk Council\n(DNC). Vibrant Spaces help\ndefine a city's unique sense of\nplace. Inside and out, they are\nwell-designed and alive with\nactivity, embracing new ideas to\ncreate one-of-a-kind experiences, products, and services. Put simply, they're the places you can't\nwait to tell your friends about.\nDrew and the DNC are helping\nto create more Vibrant Spaces\nby connecting start-up retail\nbusinesses with street-level spaces at a deep discount. These new spaces will attract talent to and retain talent in the city by making it a more interesting place to be.\nSTRATEGY 4: Redesign tools and regulations to achieve our vision for the future.\nTransforming together means that the city must create the government processes and\nregulatory environment to support resilient actions. These processes must be designed in a way that fosters community collaboration and engagement.\nDevelop the most resilient zoning\ncode in America.\nWith assistance from Clarion\nAssociates, Renaissance Planning Group, Herd Planning & Design, Greehan,\nTaves, Pandak & Stoner, and the\nMiles Agency, the City of Norfolk is\nundertaking a comprehensive rewrite\nof the zoning code. The new code\naspires to be a user-friendly document\nthat incorporates modern best\npractices, supports and encourages\nresilient development, promotes\nenvironmentally friendly development,\nand recognizes the different characters of districts throughout the city. The city's Planning Department has been central in the development of this resilience\nstrategy and has set the ambitious\ngoal of using this zoning code rewrite\nto create the new gold standard for\nintegrating resilience principles into land use planning. The rewrite will serve as a model for coastal zoning nationwide.\nTimeline: The zoning code rewrite\nprocess began in November 2014, and completion is targeted for 2017.\nPartner with academia and diverse cities on the future of land use.\nWith leadership from Norfolk and\nsupport from 100RC, the cities of\nBoulder, New York, New Orleans, and\nNorfolk participated in a workshop\nwith national land use experts to\ndiscuss how to infuse land use policies\nwith resilient practices. As these cities\nembark on substantial updates of\ntheir land use and citywide plans, the\nworkshop enabled the cities to develop land use principles and practices to enhance resilience. Norfolk is incorporating the lessons and technical assistance from the workshop into its zoning code rewrite process and the Vision 2100 plan. 100RC anticipates publication of a workshop summary report, Leveraging Land Use Regulation to Achieve City Resilience Goals.\nTimeline: Ongoing. Outcomes from\nthe land use workshop are being\nincorporated into the city's ongoing\nzoning code rewrite. 100RC anticipates releasing the workshop report in fall 2015.\nUse Better Block demonstrations\nto test design ideas.\nWorking with citizens, the city held\nthree Better Block demonstration\nprojects to test design ideas in the\ncity's downtown, Park Place, and Wards Corner neighborhoods. Citizens tested ideas for creating new businesses,\nexpanding public spaces, and calming\ntraffic to improve the pedestrian\nexperience. The experiments are now\ndriving permanent improvements in\nthese neighborhoods.\nTimeline: This launched in 2013.\nImprovements have been and are continuing\nto be implemented. To build on these\nsuccessful efforts, the city will partner with\n100RC partner Street Plans Collaborative\nto identify and plan a new demonstration\nproject focused on placemaking, economic\ndevelopment, or active transportation that can be advanced in the near-term by residents. Update the Long-Term Recovery Plan.\nThe City of Norfolk's Department of\nEmergency Preparedness and Response,\nin collaboration with the city's Planning\nDepartment and Resilience Office, is drafting\na Long-Term Recovery Plan that will provide\nguidance on how the city will respond to and bounce forward from a major disaster.\nTimeline: Ongoing. The city is beginning\nby reviewing models from other cities. The\nPlanning and Neighborhood Development\ndepartments' Asset Mapping and Vision 2100\nprocesses in early 2016 will create the general principles for developing the plan.\nDevelop a new rapid housing recovery\nmodel.\nSupported by a grant from the U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment, Old Dominion University\nis working with the cities of Norfolk and\nPortsmouth to create a rapid housing\nrecovery model. The goal is to provide cities\nwith a tool to identify factors that enhance\nhousing production capacity, speed the\napproach back to normalcy, and strengthen\nthe housing sector's resilience in the wake of\na disaster.\nTimeline: Model development is underway\nand will be available in fall 2016.\nBetter Block\nIn 2013, more than 130 citizen\nvolunteers teamed with the city in a\nBetter Block demonstration project.\nUsing planning and infrastructure tools to guide development, the team tested ideas for a Downtown Arts and Design District. Not long after the weekend\nevent, properties that had long stood\nvacant began to sell and lease and\nshops, galleries, and restaurants began\nto open. People started coming to\nlive, work, and play in the district. This\nonce largely neglected area is now\nthriving with business, philanthropic\ninvestment, and exciting programming, and it has benefited from significant redevelopment in formerly vacant properties.\nResilience partners include:\n100 Resilient Cities network\nCity of Boulder\nCity of New Orleans\nCity of New York\nCity of Norfolk\nClarion Associates\nGreehan, Taves, Pandak & Stoner Herd Planning & Design Miles Agency\nOld Dominion University\nRenaissance Planning Group\nGOAL 2: Create Economic Opportunity by Advancing\nEfforts to Grow Existing\nIndustries and New Sectors\nNorfolk's economy is dependent on two strong assets: Naval Station Norfolk and the Port of Virginia. A trend of declining spending and job investment and an uncertai n future geopolitical context make it unlikely that traditional naval activities alone will drive economic growth in the city. While the Port of Virginia is projected to grow, the city has not maximized its position near the port to cultivate an export economy in the city.\nTo diversify the economy, while also creating opportunity for living-wage employment for all of our citizens, the city will focus economic development on expanding existing businesses, helping new businesses start, improving the workforce to attract and retain businesses, and revitalizing our neighborhoods to provide great places for people to live, work, and play.\nSTRATEGY 1: Create a multi-pronged economic development strategy.\nTo define and lead a disciplined approach to creating economic opportunity, Norfolk has\nexamined its current economic drivers and identified the potential for existing and new sectors\nto drive economic growth. Moving forward, the city will incorporate this knowledge into a plan\nto guide the city's efforts and investment to increase economic growth, provide greater access to higher-paying jobs, and build the city's resilience to existing economic stresses.\nACTIONS Understand and articulate Norfolk's unique economic importance.\nThe Port of Virginia and Naval Station Norfolk create tremendous economic and security benefits, and both of these global assets rely directly on the City of Norfolk. To better understand those interdependencies, and make a case for more investment and protection, experts at the Sandia National Labs are calculating the cost to the world of disruptive flooding in Norfolk. The analysis will help reinforce the economic importance of Norfolk to the region and nation and\nbolster efforts to strengthen partnerships between the city and the port.\nTimeline: A report is anticipated for fall 2015.\nCraft an economic development plan for a resilient future.\nNorfolk's Department of Development is creating a new Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy that builds on the comprehensive economic baseline study conducted for this strategy, and incorporates resilience thinking to set goals and identify opportunities for the city's economic future. The strategy will incorporate business\nrecruitment, expansion, retention, and creation using identified growth areas, with an emphasis on capturing markets outside of the region. Norfolk's work will feed into a regional strategy led by the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission.\nTimeline: Upcoming. The planning effort will begin in January 2016.\nCultivate new capital for job creation.\nNorfolk's Department of Development\nis working with the U.S. Citizens and\nImmigration Service to establish an EB-5\nRegional Center, which will allow foreign\ndirect investment in regional projects\nthat create jobs. EB-5 funding will create\na new source of capital for job-creating\ndevelopments in the city.\nTimeline: Ongoing. The new regional center\nis anticipated to launch in 2016.\nBetter leverage the export market for\nlocal economic growth.\nThrough a community-driven process, the\nHampton Roads Community Foundation\nidentified increasing the region's share of the export market as an important economic development strategy. The foundation is\nfunding the new Regional Export Assistance Program (REAP) to connect local businesses with training, business analytics, and incentives to help companies expand into new markets outside of the region.\nTimeline: This launched in fall 2015.\nResilience partners include:\nCity of Norfolk\nHampton Roads Planning District Commission ReInvent Hampton Roads\nGOAL 2: Create Economic Opportunity by Advancing Efforts to Grow Existing Industries and New Sectors\nSTRATEGY 2: Nurture the city's entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nNorfolk has emerged over the past few years as a burgeoning center for entrepreneurs. These\nsmall and growing enterprises infuse energy and excitement into the city. Throughout the\nstrategy process, the city engaged these entrepreneurs and identified that, to accelerate growth, it is critical that Norfolk address the key challenges of access to capital and access to talent.\nACTIONS\nLaunch a new Resilience Lab\/\nAccelerator.\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia and a\nconsortium of partners, including Old\nDominion University and the City of\nNorfolk, are launching a Resilience Lab\/\nAccelerator to serve as a connector\nbetween problems, solutions, and market\nfor the region's resilience challenges. The\ngoal is to create new businesses through\nthe process of building citywide resilience.\nThe partners recognize that solving the\nissues of living on the coast, with the\nimpacts of sea level rise, will require\ntremendous investment in infrastructure,\ndata analysis, and adaptation. The Lab\/\nAccelerator will work to capture a portion of the new resilience market by connecting problems with solutions and products.\nTimeline: Fall 2016.\nCreate and sustain a vibrant business\ncommunity.\nIn collaboration with the private, university, and nonprofit sectors, the City of Norfolk has launched or supported a series of\nprograms and projects to encourage the\ncreation of new businesses and to help\nexisting businesses grow, including:\n\u2022 Export Tech to assist local companies in accessing the export market.\n\u2022 Community cafes to provide\nNorfolk's Global Initiatives Fund Starting in 2015, the City of Norfolk is funding and administering a Global Initiatives Fund to support local exporters by providing patient, flexible capital to fund their export-related activities. This innovative demonstration program recognizes Norfolk's unique port asset and serves small and medium-sized enterprises seeking to expand into global markets. Norfolk's Global Initiatives Fund is the first global commerce initiative of its kind launched by a local government institution in the United States.\nneighborhood-based financial, mentoring, legal, and marketing support to small businesses, and HATCH, Start Norfolk, and Old Dominion University's Norfolk Innovation Center to provide incubator space, business training, mentoring, and access to finance for promising business startups.\n\u2022 757 Angels, a new network of investors that provides early-stage investment capital for emerging companies. Since the launch in February 2015, 757 Angels' 86 investor members have invested more than $1 million in local companies.\nTimeline: Some initiatives launched in\nsummer 2015.\nResilience partners include:\n757 Angels\nBank of Hampton Roads\nCity of Norfolk\nFulton Bank\nHATCH\nHampton Roads Chamber of Commerce\nHampton Roads Community Foundation\nOld Dominion University\nOpportunity Inc.\nRetail Alliance\nSunTrust Bank\nScore of Hampton Roads\nVirginia Department of Housing and Community Development U.S. Small Business Administration\nJames Rogers and Norfolk's\nDepartment of Neighborhood\nDevelopment are supporting\ncommunity-led efforts to\nstrengthen the city. Through\nthe soon-to-be-launched Rent\nReady program, James and his\nteam will connect landlords\nand renters to information that\nimproves outcomes for both.\nLandlords who complete the\nRent Ready Academy, sign up\nfor the Emergency Notification\nDatabase, and pass a quality\nassessment inspection are eligible to receive a Rent Ready score. They will also be highlighted\non a Rent Ready properties\nwebsite that assists prospective\nrenters with selecting quality\nrentals, and will receive services\nand resources to equip them to attract more renters. Through the Rent Ready Academy Renters\nTrack, renters learn about their\nrights and responsibilities and\nhow to be a great resident of\none of Norfolk's neighborhoods.\nGOAL 2: Create Economic Opportunity by Advancing Efforts to Grow Existing Industries and New Sectors\nSTRATEGY 3: Strengthen the workforce development pipeline.\nA highly qualified workforce is key to the city's future economic growth. Understanding the\nskills needed to fuel the future economy and ensuring that residents have access to training\nopportunities that build those skills are essential to building the city's resilience. Building a strong workforce starts with youth. We must create pathways for growth and ensure ongoing access to education and opportunity through adulthood. Working with partners, the City of Norfolk is committed to creating high-quality opportunities for our residents to build the knowledge and skills that enable them to support our growth while earning wages that support their families.\nACTIONS Create a career pipeline for low-income residents.\nNorfolk's Department of Development is developing partnerships with national corporations to offer job training\nopportunities that result in living-wage employment for low-income residents.\nThe department is investigating how\nthese projects might be financed using social impact bonds and program-related investments. The goal is to grow the\nnumber of living-wage jobs and improve the employment pipeline for residents by providing targeted and comprehensive\ntraining financed with partners, lowering the cost to the city.\nTimeline: Fall 2015.\nOpen the region's first career pathways school.\nThe City of Norfolk, Norfolk Public Schools, the Greater Norfolk Corporation, and others are working together to open the region's first career technical school and workforce development center. The goal is to give students and transitioning workers opportunities to gain technical\ncompetency in high-employment, indemand fields, including shipbuilding and\nrepair, medical services, and information technology. Located in Norfolk, the center will be open to students and transitioning workers from throughout the region, and will have a direct impact on strengthening the workforce development pipeline.\nTimeline: The opening is anticipated for 2018.\nProvide early interventions as part of a robust early childhood education system.\nA strong workforce pipeline starts with ensuring that all children arrive at school ready to learn; that takes a strong early care and education system. Sentara Healthcare and The Planning Council joined forces to create a critical part of that system, a Universal Newborn Screening and Referral Program. The program provides services to families identified as at-risk across multiple factors that can lead to child abuse or neglect. The goal is to connect families with services to ultimately reduce the number of children who are abused or neglected. Started at Sentara's Norfolk General Hospital, the program will soon expand to Norfolk's Sentara Leigh Hospital.\nTimeline: Ongoing. Expansion will take place in 2016.\nUniversal Screening and Referral Pilot Early identification is key to delivering effective parenting services to reduce child abuse and neglect. In July 2014, Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, The Planning Council, and the city collectively launched Care Connection, a screening program to identify families with multiple risk factors. Nurses use a behavioral health risk checklist to screen newborns' families. Those identified with risk factors are referred to an intake specialist at The Planning Council. The specialist helps those families find needed services to mitigate the identified risk factors. This effort and efforts to improve the quality of early education offerings are part of the city's comprehensive effort to strengthen the first segments of the workforce development pipeline.\nResilience partners include: City of Norfolk Greater Norfolk Corporation Norfolk Public Schools Opportunity Inc.\nOld Dominion University Sentara Healthcare The Planning Council\nGOAL 2: Create Economic Opportunity by Advancing Efforts to Grow Existing Industries and New Sectors\nSTRATEGY 4: Reinvest and revitalize neighborhoods.\nNorfolk's future economic strength is tied to the vitality of our neighborhoods. Concentrated\npoverty, lack of educational and workforce opportunities, and social isolation restrict economic\nvitality in many of our neighborhoods. To ensure our future resilience, we will focus on actions\nthat deconcentrate poverty by mixing incomes and uses, create affordable housing opportunities, and build neighborhood-level capacity to drive economic development.\nACTIONS Increase homeownership and deconcentrate poverty.\nThe City of Norfolk is working with for-profit and nonprofit developers to build single-family houses on vacant properties throughout the\ncity, with a goal of increasing homeownership and deconcentrating poverty. The city's program, called \u201cLots of Opportunity,\u201d targets households in a range from 60 percent to 120 percent of median income. The program is aimed at first-time homebuyers and allows the city to develop housing for a variety of incomes.\nTimeline: This launched in fall 2015.\nImplement targeted, place-based revitalization efforts.\nThe City of Norfolk, in partnership with the Norfolk Housing and Redevelopment Authority, is exploring place-based models to revitalize areas of highly concentrated poverty. Norfolk is exploring options that bring\ntogether innovations in education, housing, and economic development to remake areas in the city and provide opportunities for our citizens to thrive. The city also is focusing\non neighborhoods that experience chronic flooding, using the need to remake the landscape as an opportunity to strengthen neighborhood and economic resilience. City leadership has visited model sites in other cities, including Purpose Built Communities sites, and is identifying critical model\ncomponents for implementation.\nTimeline: The fact-finding phase launched in October 2015.\nGrow the capacity of local CDCs to\nbuild resilient neighborhoods.\nThe City of Norfolk is issuing a request\nfor proposals for a high-quality provider to\ntrain and support community development corporations (CDCs). The goal is to grow the capacity of local CDCs so they can\nplay a more dynamic role in neighborhood revitalization efforts, which links them to the\nBank on Norfolk\nIn January 2016, the city will launch Bank On Norfolk, a program that works with banks and credit unions to reduce barriers to banking and increase access to the financial mainstream. This voluntary, public-private partnership between local government, financial institutions, and\ncommunity-based organizations provides low-income un- and under-banked people with free or low-cost starter \u201csecond\nchance\u201d bank accounts and financial education. The program's unique ten-month class component teaches unbanked citizens the financial benefits of using mainstream\nbanking services. Currently, 11.4 percent of Norfolk residents are unbanked, and 27.5 percent are under-banked. Bank On Norfolk helps reduce these percentages by connecting residents to financial institutions, providing comprehensive education on banking and budgeting, and building financial security by incentivizing savings.\nRESILIENT CITY BUILDERS\nlarger resilience goals of the\ncity. Areas of development will\ninclude mixed financing and equity\nfinancing of affordable housing units, business creation and expansion using HUD entitlement funds, and community leadership support.\nTimeline: A request for proposals\nwas released in October 2015.\nLaunch a new Affordable\nHousing Trust Fund.\nAs Norfolk's Plan to Reduce\nPoverty demonstrated, housing\ncosts are a threat to neighborhood stability. The City of Norfolk is working with a consortium of private sector and nonprofit partners to launch a new\nAffordable Housing Trust Fund. In\nthe city's FY 2016 budget, Norfolk's city council authorized funds to establish the trust fund. City staff are organizing an education series on housing trust funds for potential partners. The goal is to establish the operating principles and long-term, sustainable funding sources for the fund.\nTimeline: A draft of operating\nprinciples for the fund will be\ncompleted by January 2016.\nResilience partners include:\nCity of Norfolk\nMayor's Commission on Poverty Reduction,\nHelp stabilize families to build\nstronger neighborhoods.\nThe Planning Council operates a\nprogram using housing specialists\nto reach out to landlords, identify\nhousing available to low-income\nfamilies, and build relationships to\nfurther expand rental opportunities for safe, affordable, and accessible housing. Housing specialists\nnegotiate with landlords to help\nwith the rental process, promote\nthe use of the affordable housing\nwebsite to landlords and property\nmanagers, provide ongoing tenant\nand landlord education, and work\nwith tenants to help ensure housing stability. The goal of the program is to provide resilient housing\nopportunities and long-term\nhousing stability for vulnerable\nresidents.\nTimeline: This has been operational since 2012.\nNorfolk Housing and Redevelopment Authority\nThe Planning Council.\nIn Park Place, a group of residents led by current School Board Chair Rodney Jordan partnered with\nthe city to pursue a resident-\ndriven, healthy neighborhood\napproach to neighborhood\nrevitalization and competitiveness. The effort led to the creation of the Greater Park Place Visioning and Engagement Process (VEP), which was the impetus for\nthe city's Neighbors Building\nNeighborhoods initiative. The\nVEP is a resident-led revitalization effort in which neighbors help neighbors create and implement a vision for growing their\nneighborhood by focusing on its\nstrengths. By connecting neighbors around a vision of growing healthy internal and external partnerships, the residents of Park Place are\ncreating a neighborhood\nwhere families will want to live,\nwork, and play in Norfolk.\nGOAL 2: Create Economic Opportunity by Advancing Efforts to Grow Existing Industries and New Sectors\nSTRATEGY 5: Explore innovative financing methods.\nResourcing resilience solutions is one of the primary challenges cities face; Norfolk is no different. What makes Norfolk unique, however, is its commitment to developing new financing methods and refocusing existing resources to implement the city's 45 resilience strategies. Norfolk and\nits partners are exploring innovative ways to capture the financial benefits of risk-reducing\nresilience investments to support additional investment in resilience efforts.\nACTIONS Pioneer the creation of new risk reduction bond.\nSupported by The Rockefeller Foundation,\nthe RE.bound Program, which brings together\na team of private sector leaders, is taking\nsteps to design a new catastrophe bond-like product that can promote project-based risk reduction solutions. These new types of instruments would realize the potential insurance benefits from infrastructure\nimprovements and monetize the physical and financial risk reductions associated with investments in resilient systems, such as\nseawalls and green stormwater infrastructure. RE.bound intends to fix this problem by modeling the financial benefits of specific resilient infrastructure projects upfront and integrating insurance coverage with investment in long-term risk reduction. Norfolk's departments of Budget and\nStrategic Planning and Finance are exploring how the RE.bound approach might help fund needed flood mitigation projects in the city.\nTimeline: A complete review of the catastrophe bond process and its potential impact on the city's overall fiscal position is underway.\nInvestigate using social impact bonds to finance programs to advance social and economic resilience.\nThe City of Norfolk is working with Social Finance, a 100RC platform partner, to investigate the use of social impact bonds\nCatastrophe Bonds\nThe private sector, philanthropy, and the City of Norfolk are driving innovation in capital markets. The city is applying lessons from The RE.bound Program to explore the use of a catastrophe\nbond-like product that reduces the city's exposure to loss due from a disaster. This type of bond can provide cost-effective\ninsurance and help mobilize resources to mitigate against insured risk. A city is able to access capital for mitigation without\nincreasing debt.\nRE.invest\nThe RE.invest initiative is a collaboration among eight partner cities and leading engineering, law, and finance firms to create new public-private partnerships for resilient infrastructure. In Norfolk, the RE.invest initiative focused on integrated flood management solutions in the\nArts District. Solutions included cost-\neffective green infrastructure options and seawall upgrades to address frequent flooding that currently limits economic development. The team also identified relevant legal and financial mechanisms to support public and private\ninvestments in the innovative solutions.\nRESILIENT CITY BUILDERS\nto finance social service programs. Social\nimpact bonds provide private investors with an opportunity to fund programs designed to create value or lessen the cost of city\nservices. For example, a bond might fund a\ntraining program that helps residents obtain living-wage employment. Bond investors receive payments when program goals are met.\nTimeline: The initial workshop on social\nimpact bonds with city staff and potential\nnonprofit and philanthropy partners will be held in 2016.\nCreate new investment funds for local\nbusiness.\nNorfolk's Department of Development\nhas created four new investment funds\nto support local businesses and local\nneighborhood revitalization projects. The\nCitywide Partnership Fund, the Global\nInitiatives Fund, the Norfolk Innovation Fund, and the Grow Norfolk fund provide $3 million annually to start and grow existing businesses in Norfolk. These funds will spur business creation, business expansion, and revitalization of the city's commercial corridors. As these funds grow, we will seek opportunities to give priority financing to businesses that advance the resilience themes of this strategy.\nTimeline: This launched in July 2015.\nResilience partners include:\n100 Resilient Cities City of Norfolk\nThe Rockefeller Foundation Social Finance\nAntipas Harris is the President\nof GIELD, a nonprofit\norganization dedicated to\ndeveloping quality leaders\nwithin the church and society.\nDr. Harris is supporting the\neffort to connect local churches to Bank On Norfolk. Bank On helps unbanked or underbanked residents connect to free or low-cost starter bank accounts and financial education. The local faith community will support the Bank On effort by providing matching dollars to incentivize residents to create emergency funds. By helping low-income residents save for emergencies, Dr. Harris and the Norfolk Senior Pastors' Roundtable are building the city's economic resilience.\nGOAL 3: Advance Initiatives to Connect Communities, Deconcentrate Poverty, and Strengthen Neighborhoods\nTogether we are stronger. Whether\nconditions are good or challenging, we\nwork better, are safer, and are more\nproductive when we are connected,\ncommunicating, and supporting each\nother. As changing conditions lead to\nnew ways of living and working, we are\ncommitted to building better by building together. We aspire to be a city where all residents are connected to the resources they need to be successful and are\ncompelled to seize every opportunity to build our city into a great place to live, work, and play for all.\nConnected neighbors build strong\nneighborhoods that are safer, deliver\na higher quality of life for residents,\nand protect people better in times of\nemergency. Norfolk's Neighbors Building Neighborhoods (NBN) initiative was built on the premise that more cohesive communities are safer, more prosperous communities, and on the fundamental belief that individuals are the catalysts for change in their communities. This plan seeks to complement and support the successful work accomplished\nand underway by NBN to strengthen\ncommunities and build resilience at the individual, neighborhood, and city level.\nGOAL 3: Advance Initiatives to Connect Communities, Deconcentrate Poverty, and Strengthen Neighborhoods\nSTRATEGY 1: Improve citizen access to information.\nTimely access to accurate information is critical to an individual's ability to make informed decisions\u2014in good times and bad. By creating systems that can integrate and disseminate data into actionable information, Norfolk is developing the building blocks for information-based decision-making.\nACTIONS Launch a state-of-the-art Resilience Dashboard.\nIn close partnership with 100RC's platform partner Palantir, a global data integration company, the City of Norfolk is pioneering a new resilience module to integrate key data, improve the city's ability to respond to citizens today, and better plan for the future. The city's Information Technology Department and Palantir have improved the city's data integration, which gives users the ability to analyze information in a single platform. Dozens of staff in multiple departments, including Neighborhood Development, Planning, and Public Works, are using the dashboard to connect building, code violation, permitting, storm damage, and calls-for-service data to improve service delivery at the neighborhood level. Norfolk will capture lessons learned to help Palantir find ways to bring this new dashboard to other cities around the world.\nTimeline: This launched in 2015.\nRaise awareness of risks and resources to keep persons and property safe during storms.\nThe City of Norfolk has convened a working group of city staff and insurance, banking, planning, and community representatives to create a communications\nPalantir Data Analysis System To help solve hard problems, Norfolk is working with Palantir, a data analytics company, to change the way the city uses information. By bringing together data on flooding, buildings, code violations, permits, and calls for service, staff can provide interested residents with a better understanding of what's working well and what's not working well in our neighborhoods. The city's neighborhood specialists work with civic leagues to identify problems to be solved by analyzing what's happening and why. Staff use neighborhood-specific, real-time information that connects events, places, and people to assist residents to take actions that make their communities stronger.\nRESILIENT CITY BUILDERS\ncampaign to alert citizens to the risks of flooding. The campaign will raise awareness of risks and resources to aid residents in informed decisionmaking during storms. The city will use city-owned media as well as local media to spread the word.\nTimeline: The campaign will launch in winter 2016.\nInvolve citizens in budget development.\nThe city's departments of Communications and Budget and Strategic Planning convene residents each year for conversations on the city's budget. Over time, the focus of these gatherings has evolved from a summary of annual city spending to a discussion of the vision of Norfolk's future and priorities. These conversations provide an opportunity for residents and city staff to work collectively in establishing priorities, and to implement plans that build on that collective vision. To date, more than 600 residents have parti cipated in these conversations.\nTimeline: Community\nconversations will be held during the fall and winter of\n2015 and 2016.\nReduce barriers to banking and financial mainstream.\nThe City of Norfolk is working with financial institutions and community groups to establish the Bank On Norfolk program. Bank On Norfolk takes a strategic approach to helping families build financial strength through connections to banking services, education, and mentoring. Bank On works with unbanked and underbanked residents to increase the financial stability of low- to moderate-income families by connecting them to traditional financial services and providing them with alternatives to expensive financial transacti ons. Timeline: This will launch in winter 2016.\nResilience partners include:\nCity of Norfolk Faith community Local banks Local media outlets Old Dominion University Palantir\nJim Redick, Director of Emergency Prepared-ness and Response for the City of Norfolk, understands the power of collaboration. Through Team Norfolk, Jim brings together government, the private sector, nonprofits, the faith community, higher education, and the military. With these community partners, Jim is building a collective effort to address all threats, including sea level rise. Jim believes connecting networks, forming relationships, and leveraging ideas and resources are key to building resilience. Beyond coordinating work in Norfolk, Jim serves as the chair of the Hampton Roads Sea Level Rise Preparedness and Resilience Intergovernmental Pilot Project, a White House initiative to coordinate \u201cthe whole of government\u201d in planning for sea level rise. Jim is also co-chair of the Subcommittee on Recurrent Flooding, part of Virginia's Secure Commonwealth Panel.\nSTRATEGY 2: Support community-building efforts through technology.\nResearch confirms that connected, cohesive communities bounce back better from disruptive\nevents. Advances in technology can help people more easily connect networks of people\ntogether. Norfolk will continue to build community by piloting new networking technologies that connect vulnerable populations with community and services.\nACTIONS Develop new technology to help residents support those in need.\nThe City of Norfolk, local civic leagues, and local technology firm Concursive are working together to launch the\nHelping Hands program. Helping Hands is a smartphone app that connects small networks of residents as they support\nvulnerable neighbors during emergencies. The app provides information about emergency conditions and identifies resources to hyper-local networks\navailable to assist at-risk neighbors when life-supporting services are disrupted by an event. This helps build community connection and ensure citizen safety while reducing burdens on emergency responders during emergencies.\nTimeline: This will launch in winter 2016.\nConnect the faith community with emergency responders.\nThe city's faith-based community is working with the Norfolk Department of Emergency Preparedness and Response on Operation Brother's Keeper. This\ninitiative empowers neighborhood faith-based communities to support emergency preparedness efforts across the city. Faith-based institutions volunteer to act as communication and supply distribution centers and shelters, thereby ensuring the distribution of supplies and services at the neighborhood level during disasters. Information connecting residents\nto these services is broadcast through\nwebsites and smartphone applications.\nTimeline: Launched in 2015.\nUse technology to support local\ngiving.\nSeveral local Boy Scout troops,\nConcursive, and community members\nhave launched We Feed Norfolk. We\nFeed Norfolk uses mobile technology to\ncommunicate opportunities for residents to volunteer and give back to other residents. The pilot successfully engaged residents in donating over 3,500 pounds of food to the local food bank. The goal is to increase citizen participation in programs that support their communities, and the technology could be used in many different ways.\nTimeline: Ongoing. This launched in 2015.\nResilience partners include:\nCity of Norfolk Civic leagues\nConcursive\nFaith-based community\nFoodBank of Southeastern Virginia\nLocal Boy Scouts of America troops\nSTRATEGY 3: Connect the community through conversation.\nThe City of Norfolk is committed to continually improving methods for citizens to connect with each other and their government to define the city's future. Norfolk believes that citizens who\nare engaged in building the vision for the future will be active in working to implement that\nvision.\nCollaborate with residents to map neighborhood assets.\nThe city's Department of\nNeighborhood Development is helping residents map their neighborhood's physical, social, and economic assets. This asset-mapping process will help the city identify those characteristics and places that make neighborhoods strong in good times, and provide\ncrucial support in times of emergency. The city's Neighbors Building Neighborhoods initiative will leverage this analysis to work with local communities to build neighborhoods of choice\u2014places where people choose to live because of the high quality of life.\nTimeline: Community mapping\nsessions will be held in winter 2016.\nCreate new dialogues between the police and the community leaders.\nThe city's police department and community leaders are working together to build a stronger police-community relationship. Community and police leaders engage in frank discussions about critical issues, including bias-free policing, use of force, and police recruiting. The goal is to create open lines of communication to ensure that the community\nand the police department are\nworking together effectively to keep\ncommunities safe.\nTimeline: This program was launched in 2015.\nOutreach through community\nevents.\nPolice Chief Michael Goldsmith\nand Neighborhood Development\nDirector James Rogers have instituted \u201cHamburgers and Hotdogs with the Chief of Police\u201d events. Chief Goldsmith and Rogers regularly meet with residents in neighborhood homes and parks and at neighborhood-sponsored events to discuss important issues about the department's\ninteractions with citizens. The goal\nis for the chief to hear firsthand the\nconcerns of residents and for residents to have a direct communication with the leadership of the force.\nTimeline: This launched in 2014.\nEngage diverse voices through\nthe Norfolk Senior Pastors'\nRoundtable.\nThe local faith-based community\nand city leaders have convened a\npastoral roundtable. The roundtable\nmeets frequently to discuss important community issues. These meetings act\nas an opportunity to listen, share, and\nvet ideas on topics of interest to the city and the faith-based community. The goal is to create consensus around and to\ncollaboratively implement actions that\ndrive positive change. Through roundtable discussions, local churches have agreed to raise funds to match savings of\nparticipants in the city's Bank On Norfolk program.\nTimeline: This initiative is already\nunderway.\nResilience partners include:\nCity of Norfolk Civic leagues\nFaith-based community\nThe Norfolk Senior Pastors' Roundtable\nThe roundtable was established in January 2015 and serves as a trusted environment that values and fosters frank discussions\nwith faith-based partners about issues\nthey find important for the thousands of\nresidents they serve in the City of Norfolk. The roundtable provides the city manager with an opportunity to discuss important issues to better our city. The roundtable's stated commitment is to work toward\nthe well-being of the city, especially as\nit relates to social and economic justice\nand ethnic harmony. The meetings are\nheld monthly and rotate among the city's houses of worship. The pastors involved in the roundtable represent approximately\n15,000 congregants.\nDave Richards has lived in a\nnumber of Norfolk neighborhoods over the past 25 years and coowns Concursive, a technology company located in downtown Norfolk. Dave believes Norfolk should be the most connected city in the world, especially as it relates to \u201cdoing things that matter!\u201d To jump-start that effort, he launched We Feed Norfolk, enlisting local Boy Scout troops 24 and 1 to collect food donations from area residents. The program distributes reusable bags to the front doors of Norfolk residents and asks them to sign up and download the We Feed Norfolk app on a smartphone. Dave and other volunteers send out a message alerting users that the Boy Scouts will be out collecting the bags full of food. Residents who want to participate leave the bag of food on their porch and press the app for a pickup. In just the three initial pilot runs, the program collected over 3,500 pounds of food for the region's food bank.\nNorfolk's Resilience Strategy represents the first step toward creating and cultivating an ongoing resilience practice across the city. In addition to moving these strategies and actions forward,\nNorfolk's Resilience Strategy will accomplish the following tasks over the next nine to twelve\nmonths:\n\u2022 Identify and showcase a growing number of Norfolk's Resilient City Builders, both organizational partners and individuals. Optimally, by July\n2016, we will have recognized one hundred people and organizations as Norfolk Resilient City Builders.\n\u2022 Establish a global practice on water innovation. Norfolk is a hub of activity for advancing next-generation thinking on living with the water.\nFrom the Dutch Dialogues to the\nResilience Lab\/Accelerator to the\n100RC exchange and community of\npractitioners, Norfolk will be a leading global thinker\u2014and doer.\nPartner with other 100RC network cities to create innovations in resilience. For example, the cities of New Orleans and Norfolk will partner on developing innovative financing to fund infrastructure improvements and accelerate economic vitality.\nWhat's Next\n\u2022 Hold the second Norfolk Resilient City Builder Summit event in July 2016. This event will bring together Norfolk's Resilient City\nBuilders to review and discuss our resilience planning efforts to date, including this strategy.\n\u2022 Measure the city's resilience performance and institutionalize new practices by creating a resilience program performance dashboard and developing an ongoing communications\nsystem that will institutionalize resilience planning and implementation for centuries to come.\n\u2022 Continue to transform the way Norfolk does business.The future of Norfolk depends on putting in place resilience strategies\nthat propel the city forward today and that efficiently activate in times of need to ensure the city stays safe and strong. By working\ntogether as a community and partnering with the expertise and resources available throughout 100RC, Norfolk is leading a\nmovement to build resilient cities across the globe. Collectively, we are transforming the way our city works \u2014 collaboratively, proactively, thoughtfully, and inspired by an understanding that the challenges before\nus provide an opportunity to build an even better, more vibrant Norfolk for the next 400 years.","ENTITIES":{"ORGANIZATION":["Greater Park Place Visioning","Norfolk Senior Pastors' Roundtable","Old Dominion University","Neighborhood Development","Old Dominion University Palantir Jim Redick","City of Norfolk 's Department of Emergency Preparedness and Response","Dominion University","Norfolk's Resilience Strategy","City of Norfolk Hampton Roads Planning District Commission ReInvent Hampton Roads","Chesterfield Heights Civic League","Platform Partners","Social Finance","Department of Housing and Urban Development","Rent Ready Academy Renters Track","Grow Existing Industries","Norfolk 's Department of Development","Hampton Roads Sea Level Rise Preparedness","Secure Commonwealth Panel","DNC","Resilience Intergovernmental Pilot Project","Achieve City Resilience Goals","Norfolk Department of Emergency Preparedness and Response on Operation Brother","Collaboratory","VEP","Connect Communities","Tidewater Community College","Waggonner & Ball Architects Vision of Newton","Lafayette Wetlands Partnership","Norfolk Housing and Redevelopment Authority The Planning Council","Rockefeller Foundation","Deconcentrate Poverty","Bechtel","Resilience Strategy","ODU","USS","Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP","CRF","Coastal Community","NBN","City of Norfolk Downtown Norfolk Council Festevents Greater Norfolk Corporation Grow Nauticus Norfolk Convention and Visitors Center Virginia Arts Festival Virginia Opera Virginia Stage Company Virginia Symphony Drew Ungvarsky","Coastal Community of the Future Norfolk","City of Norfolk Mayor 's Commission on Poverty Reduction","Sandia National Labs","Hampton Roads Community Foundation","Royal Netherlands Embassy","Create Economic Opportunity","U.S. Citizens","Norfolk Today Today","Emergency Notification Database","Information Technology Department","HUD","School Board","Downtown Norfolk Council","Norfolk Innovation Center","Nauticus","Sentara","University of Pennsylvania School of Design","Sandia National Laboratories","Hampton Roads Planning District Commission","Resilient Cities City of Norfolk The Rockefeller Foundation Social Finance Antipas Harris","Norfolk Collaboratory","Miles Agency","Planning Council","American Institute of Architects ARCADIS City of Hampton City of Newport News City of Norfolk Commonwealth of Virginia Elizabeth River Project Emerging Leaders Program Hampton Roads ULI Hampton University HR & A Advisors Old Dominion University Royal Netherlands Embassy Slover Library Foundation Waggonner & Ball","Towne of Lower Norfolk County \u201d","Sentara Norfolk General Hospital","Norfolk International Terminals","Subcommittee on Recurrent Flooding","Department of Development","City Hall Avenue","Bank On Norfolk","Wards Corner","Norfolk Resilient City Builder Summit","FoodBank of Southeastern Virginia Local Boy Scouts of America","Navy","Strategic Planning and Finance","Resilience Dashboard","Structures of Coastal Resilience","Hampton University","Planning Department","Universal Newborn Screening","Design District","The Planning Council","Angels Bank of Hampton Roads City of Norfolk Fulton Bank HATCH Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce Hampton Roads Community Foundation Old Dominion University Opportunity Inc.

By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to adverse events, and overall, is better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations. Oakland was accepted into the first wave of cities in the 100RC network, alongside Berkeley and San Francisco in the Bay Area. The three cities, led by their respective Chief Resilience Officers, have been collaborating to leverage regional efficiencies for their strategy development processes, where possible, and will continue to collaborate on implementing their resilience strategies.\nThe Fox Theater originally opened its doors in 1928 as an elaborate movie palace, and serves as a symbol of resilience. It shuttered in 1966 and remained closed for 40 years, surviving a fire and an earthquake, and escaping the wrecking ball before being restored to its former splendor, reopening in 2009 as part of the renewal of the Uptown theater and arts district.\nOctober 10, 2016\nto support our promising future.\nOakland has a rich tradition of social innovation and a strong legacy of resilience. Resilience in Oakland means tackling systemic, interdependent challenges, such as equitable access to quality education and jobs, housing security, community safety and vibrant infrastructure to better prepare us for shocks like earthquakes and stresses like climate change. To achieve this, we need to leverage our collective resources by fostering a culture of responsive and trustworthy government, data-driven decisions centered around residents' needs and robust, smart infrastructure development.\nOakland has the physical and human resources to be a thriving and connected 21st century global city.\nAs the birthplace of the women\u2019s suffrage movement and the Black Panther Party, Oakland has long been an innovative, mission-driven city committed to economic and social justice and equitable growth. Our town attracts renowned activists, artists, makers, and other risk-takers within its 78 square miles addressing the serious issues of our day. Oakland\u2019s current resilience challenges are an opportunity to do what Oakland has always done: rethink old paradigms and balance the equation of access to opportunity while building more creative and vibrant infrastructure\nWe know today\u2019s greatest challenges, such as rising income inequality, which impacts our most vulnerable communities, cannot be solved by one of our agencies, organizations or communities alone. This Resilient Oakland playbook centers on increasing collaboration inside our City government through the launch of our new Civic Design Lab, building new and innovative partnerships among regional governments and co-designing community engagement processes with those who live and work in Oakland.\nA resilient Oakland manifests through robust community organizations, engaged residents and a City government opening itself up to the idea that change is inevitable \u2014we must now harness it for the benefit of our growing town.\nSincerely,\nLibby Schaaf, Mayor of Oakland\nOctober 10, 2016\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to congratulate the City of Oakland on the release of Resilient Oakland. This bold strategy will drive innovation in City government, promote economic security for residents and strengthen Oakland\u2019s neighborhoods and physical infrastructure.\nRecognizing that Oakland is best positioned to thrive when residents, community organizations, local businesses and government come together, this strategy represents a call to action for all Oaklanders. Resilient Oakland outlines concrete actions that will address current and future shocks and stresses, ranging from economic inequality to insufficient affordable housing to sea level rise to earthquakes\u2014 reflecting the holistic urban resilience approach that 100RC seeks to spread throughout our network of 100 member cities and beyond.\nMayor Libby Schaaf\u2019s leadership and support were critical in the development of this strategy, and I want to thank her for her partnership and commitment. I also want to thank Oakland\u2019s Chief Resilience Officer, Kiran Jain, for her tireless dedication and for the innovative vision that\nhas shaped Resilient Oakland.\nWhile the release of this document marks an important milestone, our work is far from over. It will take continued commitment and action to ensure that this strategy has an impact. This is why we are excited to continue our partnership as Oakland embarks upon implementation\u2014the work of making the actions described in this strategy a reality. Actions such as improving affordable housing access by redesigning the City\u2019s Rent Adjustment Program website; retrofitting homes so they produce their own energy and conserve water through the EcoBlock pilot; and preparing vulnerable communities more effectively for disasters through \u201cNeighbors Helping Neighbors\u2019\u2019 are just some of the initiatives that will lead to a more secure and vibrant future for Oakland residents.\nThese and other initiatives are making Oakland a leader in the urban resilience movement\u2014and we anticipate that many will become best practices that other cities within the 100RC Network will emulate. We are thrilled to recognize and celebrate Oakland\u2019s achievement in releasing Resilient Oakland, and look forward to our continued partnership as Oakland helps to spread urban resilience to cities across the United States and the world.\nSincerely,\nMichael Berkowitz President, 100 Resilient Cities\nOakland is one of the most diverse, creative and progressive urban coastal cities in the United States. As a major city in the Bay Area, Oakland also sits within one of the most prosperous economic growth engines in the world. The benefits of this growth, as acutely felt in Oakland, are not equitably distributed. Today, particularly among low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, Oakland faces rapidly rising income inequality and housing displacement, disparate unemployment and education rates, and chronic violence. A person living just one mile from a fellow Oaklander may be nearly twice as likely to be unemployed, and live 15 years less. Aging housing stock and public infrastructure challenged by seismic and climate risk further threaten Oakland residents, particularly our most vulnerable communities.\nIn this time of hyper-prosperity brought on, in part, by the technology and real estate booms in the San Francisco Bay Area, Oakland is uniquely positioned to take advantage of its growth while remaining true to its roots and sense of self. Resilient Oakland embraces Oakland\u2019s strengths while tackling the daily and chronic stresses facing Oaklanders today and better preparing for tomorrow\u2019s challenges.\nThough comprehensive in scope, Resilient Oakland is not a finished product or a plan in the traditional sense. Rather, this playbook is a call to action. Resilient Oakland sets forth the work we need to do to begin modernizing our City by integrating processes, policies and programs that achieve greater impact. Resilient Oakland illuminates what is possible, whether it is breaking down workforce data by demographic population to better address the needs of our underserved residents or inviting our Human Services, Housing & Community Development, and Economic & Workforce Development departments to work together on leveraging economic and housing security strategies. Through this work, we are changing the way we do government. And in the process, we are making our institutions\u2014both local and regional\u2014more resilient and responsive to whatever may come our way.\nThe Resilient Oakland playbook is a holistic set of strategies and actions to tackle systemic, interdependent challenges. This includes equitable access to quality education and jobs, housing security, community safety and vibrant infrastructure, which will better prepare us for shocks like earthquakes and climate change impacts.\nWe begin with a timeline highlighting a century of resilience in Oakland followed by a history of resilient actions the City has taken over the last 20 years to further social, economic and physical development. We then outline 15 major resilience challenges facing our town, which are then addressed by three key themes and 10 main goals accomplished through nearly 40 resilient actions.\nThe three key themes for advancing resilience in Oakland are: (1) build a more trustworthy and responsive government, (2) stay rooted and thrive in our town, and (3) build a more vibrant and connected Oakland. Some of the actions outlined under these three key themes were already underway (such the Mayor\u2019s Community Safety Plan) and are included here due to their clear resilience value, some have been adapted with a resilience lens in mind, some have been fast tracked due to the resources available through the 100 Resilient Cities program (such as digital improvements to the Rent Adjustment Program, the City\u2019s green infrastructure plan or sea level rise roadmap), and others have come about as a result of stakeholder engagement through Resilient Oakland\u2019s two-year process.\nUnder the leadership of our Chief Resilience Officer, Kiran Jain, the Resilient Oakland playbook is designed to set forth strategies that will deliver more effective governance and ways to solve complex multi-stakeholder challenges. Resilient Oakland recognizes government simply cannot spend its way out of challenges, such as housing displacement or climate adaptation. We need to approach our work differently and rethink how we maximize resources to benefit our residents and businesses. By taking a continuous build, measure, learn approach to resiliency from \u2018little bets\u20191 to \u2018moonshots\u20192, we honor the work that has been done and how we build on it today while setting forth bold actions that accelerate our ability to meet these challenges.\nThe Resilient Oakland playbook celebrates a City government opening itself up to the idea that change is inevitable\u2014we must now harness it for the benefit of our growing town.\nTHEME 1: BUILD A MORE TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT\nGOALS:\nDesign equitable and measurable community engagement\nCreate more opportunities for collaborative government\nApply data-driven principles to inform decision-making\nEngage youth in shaping the future of Oakland\nTHEME 2: STAY ROOTED AND THRIVE IN OUR TOWN\nGOALS:\nIncrease\neconomic\nsecurity\nPromote safe\tIncrease affordable\nand healthy\thousing stock\nneighborhoods\nTHEME 3: BUILD A MORE VIBRANT AND CONNECTED OAKLAND\nGOALS:\nReduce current and future climate and seismic risks\nPromote urban greening for neighborhoods most in need\nMaximize value of collective infrastructure investments\n2009\nCentral Estuary Plan\nA companion to the 1999 Estuary Policy Plan, this plan establishes the land uses, open spaces, shoreline access, as well as neighborhood revitalization and industrial economic needs for the Estuary Area.\n2013\nAdapting to Rising Tides Alameda County Pilot Project\nThis project assesses the vulnerability of a wide range of assets along the Alameda County shoreline, including in Oakland, to 16 and 55 inches of sea level rise.\n2014-2015\nSpecific Plans for West Oakland, Lake Merritt Station, Broadway Valdez District, and Coliseum Area\nThese plans identify context specific strategies for each neighborhood to provide inclusion, affordable housing, transportation connectivity, and jobs.\n2003\nOakland bans gender identity discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodation, and City services\n2002\nMeasure DD\nOver 80% of Oakland voters pass this $198.25 million bond measure focused on waterfront improvements at Lake Merritt and the Estuary.\n1996-1998\nGeneral Plan\u2014Open Space, Conservation and Recreation Element; Land Use And Transportation; Historic Preservation Elements\nThese General Plan elements designate land uses, zoning controls, management of open spaces, and preservation of historic properties to foster economic vitality.\n2012\nEnergy and Climate Action Plan\nThis plan identifies actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and outlines potential impacts due to climate change and the need to address those vulnerabilities.\n2014\n(Adopted)\n2015-2023 General Plan Housing Element\nThis plan contains policy goals to provide equal housing opportunities for all incomes, promote development of housing for low and moderate incomes, and provide affordable rental housing.\n2016\nOakland Promise\nMayor Libby Schaaf and Oakland Unified School District Superintendent Antwan Wilson launch a ten year cradie-to-career initiative that will triple the number of low-income Oakland public school graduates who complete a post-secondary education.\n2015\nPrincipled Policing Report\nMayor Libby Schaaf releases inaugural report on police discipline to be released bi-annually.\n2014\nMeasure FF\nVoters approve to raise the Oakland minimum wage to $12.25\/hour.\n2016\nNew Department of Transportation\nOakland establishes a Department of Transportation (DOT), a key milestone to more equitably bring greater safety and accessibility to Oakland's streets for the benefit of all city residents.\n2016\nLocal Hazard\nMitigation Plan\nThis plan identifies the hazards Oakland faces, the populations that are especially vulnerable to these hazards, and provides actions to reduce risk from the outlined hazards.\n2016\nMeasure KK\nCouncil places $600Mbond measure on November ballot for streets\/side-waik repair, city facilities, anti-dis placement and affordable housing.\n2016\nSuccessful \u201cNo to Coal\u201d\nOakland City Council votes to confirm an ordinance banning coal from being handled and stored in the City of Oakland.\n2016\nMeasure AA\nVoters in the Bay Area approve a new $12-per-parcel tax that will raise $500M over 20 years for habitat restoration, improve water quality and flood protection across the Bay Area.\n2016\nOakland at Home: Recommendations for Implementing a Road Map Toward Equity\nThis document provides practical and actionable solutions to address the affordability crisis.\nThese icons represent the main shocks and stresses facing Oakland,\nidentified as part of the Preliminary Resilience Assessment. Each one is described more in the following pages. The effects of the shocks such as earthquakes or wildfires are often exacerbated by long-term stresses, such as wealth disparities and limited city resources. The dashed lines represent these interconnections between the shocks and stresses.\nEquity is critical to Oakland\u2019s resilience. According to a recent report by the Public Policy Institute of California, the State\u2019s per capita gross domestic product has increased by more than 30 percent since 1997. Over this same period, top incomes have grown at more than double the rate of low and middle incomes. These trends seem contrary to the idea that \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d3 This statewide occurrence is acutely felt in Oakland where a tale of two cities, one of hyper-prosperity and the other of deep poverty, informs how resilience challenges are addressed and tackled.\nMany Oaklanders experience chronic social stresses like poverty, unemployment, and violence. Wide disparities exist in employment and wages, educational attainment, and health outcomes. These social stresses are correlated with a greater vulnerability to physical shocks: low-income households in Oakland are more likely to be located in areas at greater risk of sea level rise, seismic instability, and liquefaction. These chronic stresses compound the risks of intermittent shocks, leaving our communities that already experience inequity further exposed to risk, which further weakens our resilience as a city.\nStresses\nSocioeconomic Disparities\u2014A Tale of Two Cities\nFrom 2015 to 2016, Oakland's rental housing market saw a 15 percent increase in median rents, which is more than 5 times the national rate of increase.4 In the same time period, Oakland's office rents increased 35 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing office rental market.5 But economic growth has been unequal across the city. Technology workers are finding Oakland an increasingly attractive place in which to live and do business. Yet, this influx of wealth is placing stress on many existing residents and less-skilled workers at a time when the manufacturing industry that was once a mainstay of the Oakland economy is shrinking. Consequently, Oakland\u2019s current story is a tale of two cities. The first city is a more global Oakland, rebounded from a deep recession where citywide statistics are improving each year. The second city is the one seen by low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where the effects of these improving statistics have yet to be seen and the recovery has been painstakingly slow.\nWealth Disparities\n21%\nresidents living beneath\npoverty line\n7th\nhighest income inequality in the nation\nThe median household income of white households is nearly\nthat of any other group.\n41%\nof children live in households receiving\npublic assistance\nEducational Disparities\nOakland exceeds national levels both for the number of adults with college and post-graduate degrees and for the number of adults who did not complete high school. In the past decade, Oakland\u2019s public schools have made important gains in student achievement. Today, the Oakland Unified School District stands as California\u2019s most-improved urban school district.9 However, only a minority of Oakland\u2019s children are meeting key educational milestones.\nOn most metrics, the achievement gap persists when comparing African American and Latino students to White and Asian students. A majority of Oakland\u2019s public schools struggle to serve students, particularly students of color and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged or language minority backgrounds. Although Oakland\u2019s graduation rate has improved in recent years to 63 percent, it still lags behind the average graduation rate of 80 percent for Alameda County and California.10 Too many Oakland students are not gaining the skills needed for successful employment.\nAccess to Good Jobs\nSince the Great Recession, Oakland has seen unemployment decrease consistently. After reaching a ten-year high of 16.9 percent for 2010, Oakland\u2019s currently unemployment rate has dropped to 6.0 percent. While Oakland\u2019s unemployment rate has decreased during this period, it remains higher than current the National (4.9 percent), State (5.9 percent), and Alameda County (4.8 percent) averages.11 It is important to note that these statistics fail to capture people who are disconnected from the local economy and who have stopped searching for jobs.\nBetween July 2015 and July 2016, 29,500 new jobs were added in the East Bay. But, this job growth has not impacted all communities equally.\nOakland\u2019s current\nunemployment rate has\ndropped to\n6%\nAmong Hispanic and Latinos, the unemployment rate is\n7%\nnew jobs were added in the East Bay from 2015-2016\nAmong African Americans, the\nunemployment rate is\n9%\nAccording to the American Community Survey 2015 one year estimates, the unemployment rate among blacks was nine percent, Asians was eight percent, and Hispanic or Latinos was seven percent. These unemployment rate among communities of color during this period is in stark contrast to an unemployment rate of five percent among Whites during the same period.\nWhile the current economic conditions in Oakland have improved since 2014, these racial disparities still persist. Increasing access to good jobs means also making sure access is equitable.\nHigh Crime Rate\nBetween 2013 and 2015 Oakland had on average 84 murders per year. Although more of the shootings that occurred in 2015 were fatal, 2015 marks the third consecutive year of double-digit reductions in shootings in Oakland.14 To put this 3-year trend into perspective, nearly 250 fewer Oakland residents were injured or killed by gun violence in 2015 than in 2012, and over 1,100 fewer people were victims of violent crime in 2015 than in 2012.15 Despite progress, Oakland exceeds statewide and national trends for violent crime. Gun violence is of particular\nreported\nshootings\nin Oakland in 2014\n250\n2013 and 2014 had the\nlowest\nhomicide numbers in more than a\ndecade\nfewer Oakland\nresidents were injured or killed by\nconcern, with 341 reports of aggravated assaults with a firearm in 2015. Serious violence is most concentrated among individuals (mostly young men) 18 to 34 years old, and the highest percentage of victims and suspects are men between the ages of 18 and 24, followed by men between the ages of 25 and 34.\nViolence is disproportionately concentrated in specific parts of the city, particularly in East and West Oakland. According to law enforcement data, the individuals engaged in a majority of the robberies throughout the city are the same as those engaged in violent crime in East and West Oakland.\nThis geographic distribution correlates closely with the concentration of stressors that can increase the risk of violence like rates of arrest, crime incidence, food stamp participation rates, youth incarceration and probation rates, rates of violent suspensions, and chronic student absences.16 Insufficient Affordable Housing\nOakland is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis. Between 2012 and 2015, median market rate rental prices citywide increased substantially while the supply of housing decreased. The biggest changes occurred in rental rates for two-bedroom apartments, where market rate rents increased by 111 percent citywide while supply fell by 59 percent during this period. The second largest change in this period occurred in rental rates for one-bedroom apartments, where the rent increased by 76 percent while supply decreased by 13 percent.17 Increases in market rate rental prices at this scale mean that residents will be forced to pay a larger percentage of their household income on rent.18\nBetween 2012 and 2015, one-bedroom rents increased by\n76%\nBetween 2012 and 2015, supply of one-bedroom\napartments decreased\nBetween 2012 and 2015, two-bedroom rents increased by\nby\n111%\nAccording to the Mayor\u2019s Housing Report, Oakland at Home,19 the estimated shortfall of homes affordable to Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low Income renters in Oakland grew by an average of 1,035 homes per year from the 2000 U.S. Census and the 2008 to 2012 American Community Survey. There\nare over 26,000 severely cost-burdened, low-income renters and nearly 9,000 severely cost-burdened, low-income owners in Oakland\u2014renters or owners paying over 50 percent of their household income on rent.\nFurthermore, this housing crisis is disproportionately impacting low-income community and communities of color. African Americans represent 35 percent\u201417,125 households\u2014of homeowners that are severely cost burdened. For renters, African Americans comprise 45 percent\u201411,645 households\u2014of severely rent-burdened households.\nChronic Homelessness\nChronic homelessness is most commonly defined as a person\nexperiencing homelessness for more than a year, or an unaccompanied individual with a disabling condition who has had at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years.\nWhile only\n13%\nof Alameda County\u2019s\t|n 2015,\npopulation is African\tthere were\nAmerican...\nindividuals\nexperiencing\n...African Americans\nrepresent\n54%\nof the individuals experiencing\nhomelessness\nEvery two years Alameda County conducts a Point In Time Count (PITC) of persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. According to the 2015 PITC, there were an estimated 4,040 individuals experiencing homelessness in Alameda County.20 While only 13 percent of Alameda County\u2019s population is African American, African Americans represent 54 percent of the individuals experiencing homelessness. According to the City's Department of Human Services, in the last PITC, on any given night in Oakland, there are 2,191 homeless people, and 63 percent of them (1,384) are unsheltered\u2014living on the streets or in places not meant for habitation. While data is limited, that number appears to be growing as housing prices rise and traditional housing for very low income residents such as single-room occupancy hotels are being converted to other purposes.\nOakland provides resources for rapid re-housing, including rent subsidies, case management, and services to address root causes of homelessness. However, the supply and access to affordable housing is severely limited.\nThe City collaborates closely with housing and service providers as well as mainstream agencies in Alameda County and the Oakland Housing Authority on issues related to chronic homelessness, including winter-relief shelter efforts and housing subsidy programs for interim and permanent supportive housing. In order to provide adequate shelter for all residents, both appropriate locations and funding for additional winter shelter beds for the more difficult, colder months of the year are needed.\nTrust in Government\nWhile many American cities have seen a drop in crime this past decade, trust in local law enforcement is at the center of a national debate. Recent police misconduct in the Oakland Police Department and high crime rates have diminished trust in local police. As a result, the City government has tackled these issues by expanding its engagement efforts in recruiting a new police chief, releasing public safety data, and partnering with institutions like Stanford University to study and mitigate racial profiling. The City\u2019s holistic approach to community safety focuses on helping families thrive, neighborhoods becoming safer, and communities healing from trauma and restoring their trust in the police.\nAdditionally, ethical conduct among City staff and officials continues to be an important issue among the community. Residents at public meetings, the press, and a few public institutions have expressed concern around government transparency, including City compliance with open meeting policies or public records laws. In 2013, the Alameda County Grand Jury identified 29 instances in which City Council members interfered with the administrative functions of the City.21 In November 2014, the residents of Oakland voted to amend the City Charter in favor of increasing the Public Ethics Commission\u2019s strength, independence, and staffing. The City Council also approved the Government Ethics Act in December 2014 to provide a clear, comprehensive, and enforceable framework of ethics rules in Oakland.\nAging Infrastructure\nOakland\u2019s\ninfrastructure gets\n(inadequate\nmaintenance)\nper year shortfall for the next\n5 years\nLimited City Resources\nDespite prudent and conservative fiscal policies established since the last economic downturn and robust economic growth, over the long term, without intervention, the City\u2019s expenditures are projected to grow faster than revenues. The growth rate in revenues from taxes and fees is slower than the growth rate of personnel, utility, fuel, and other costs. Simultaneously, the City will require significant new investments in capital and services to maintain current infrastructure and quality of life. These trends, when coupled with limitations on the ability of local governments in California to generate new sources of revenue, create continual pressure to reduce government services or continue deferring capital investments. In times of economic downturn, these limitations can lead to dramatic reductions in government services at precisely the times those services are most needed by residents. Droughts\nCalifornia has historically experienced cyclical periods of extreme drought, including the present period which has lasted four years and is ongoing.\nThese droughts lead to significant mandatory conservation requirements.\nA changing climate is expected to bring deeper, longer droughts and more days of extreme heat. During a drought, Oakland experiences higher water prices, decreased cooling options during extreme-heat days, loss of shade trees and plants and open space values, and higher risk of wildfires.27 Extreme heat disproportionately affects the health of vulnerable populations.\nSea Level Rise\nOakland is\nexpected to experience\n12-24\ninches of sea level rise by 2050\nOakland is\nexpected to experience\n36-66\ninches of sea level\nAs the elevation of San Francisco Bay rises in response to warming oceans and melting ice sheets, coastal floods will only increase in frequency and severity. Low-lying coastal residential areas, the Port of Oakland, the former Oakland Army Base, and a variety of low-lying areas near the Coliseum, Oakland International Airport, and Interstate 880 are most at risk. According to the Bay Conservation and Development Commission, Oakland is expected to experience 12 to 24 inches of sea level rise by 2050 and 36 to 66 inches of sea level rise by the year 2100.23 Adapting to Rising Tides (ART) is a regional program addressing sea level rise risk in the San Francisco Bay Area. Within Oakland, the ART Subregional\nPilot Project estimated that 6,000 of Oakland\u2019s residents would be at risk from 16 inches of sea level rise, with 9,000 at risk from 55 inches of related flooding.24\nSea level rise will not impact all Oakland residents in the same way, as some are more vulnerable than others. Some communities lack access to preparedness information, transportation options, healthcare, and insurance, which increase their vulnerability to the adverse impacts of a flood event. Communities of color and low-income communities are over represented in the most vulnerable segments of the population.25\nAdaptation to sea level rise may also impact Oakland residents in different ways. Adapting will require significant public investment. Without proactive consideration of environmental justice concerns, adaptation decisions about what is protected and how it is paid for may have a disproportionate impact on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.25\nShocks\nMany of the acute shocks facing Oakland are well known. Earthquakes and wildfires have severely damaged the City in the past. The effects of such shocks are exacerbated by long-term social stresses, such as violent crime and economic, health, and educational disparities outlined previously. Now, climate change threatens the City, with impacts that are felt as both discrete shocks (coastal floods and increased wildfire risks) and continual or periodic stresses (rising seas and droughts). As the climate warms, droughts, extreme-heat days, and large rain storms are expected to occur more frequently and with greater intensity. Oakland\u2019s vulnerable residents, including the elderly, children, and communities of color, may be at a disproportionate disadvantage to these increasing threats. Earthquakes & Liquefaction\nThe Hayward Fault has a\nShaking from the Hayward fault could be\n31%\nchance of producing\na large earthquake\nwithin 30 years\nSeven major fault systems\ncapable of earthquakes of magnitude\n3 to 10\n6.7\ntimes stronger than the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake\nor larger\nIn Northern California, seven major fault systems are considered capable of rupturing in earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 or larger.26 The Hayward Fault, located at the base of the hills on the eastern edge of the City, has a 31 percent chance of producing such an earthquake within the next 30 years. An earthquake of this magnitude would cause significant damage in Oakland; shaking from the Hayward fault could be 3 to 10 times stronger than the shaking experienced in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Soft-story apartment buildings are particularly at risk; there are more than 22,000 apartment units in soft-story buildings in Oakland.27 Earthquakes also cause liquefaction, a phenomenon in which soil loses its strength, stiffness, and ability to support buildings. The U.S. Geological Survey has mapped the likelihood of liquefaction of soils in Oakland in the event of a major earthquake along the Hayward Fault.28 The flat-land areas of Oakland are at the highest risk, and these areas overlap with the locations of much of the critical transportation infrastructure and emergency operations facilities for the City. These areas are also home to many low-income and vulnerable residents. Coastal (Bay) and Urban Floods\nThe intensity and frequency of precipitation events are expected to increase due to climate change.29 The combination of higher tides due to sea level rise and larger storms with Oakland\u2019s aging stormwater drainage systems may lead to significant increases in both coastal and urban flooding and flood damage. Low-lying areas, such as the Coliseum and West Oakland neighborhood, are particularly vulnerable to coastal (Bay) and urban floods.30 In December 2014, a combination of coastal and urban flooding closed roads, businesses, and schools throughout the City, impacting public safety, education, and Oakland\u2019s economy.\nWildfires\nThe Oakland Hills Firestorm of 1991 was the most destructive fire in State history.31 Although wildfires may occur at any time of year and in any climate, the risk of fire increases greatly with increased drought and heat. California\u2019s future climate of frequent drought and higher heat leaves Oakland at extreme risk for wildfires.\n3,469\nsingle-family dwell-\nings destroyed\nin the\n$3.9\nbillion in losses in the Oakland Hills Firestorm\nlives lost in the Oakland Hills Firestorm of 1991\n25\nExternal Economic Crises\nThe City of Oakland is part of the San Francisco Bay Area regional economy, which, like most local economies in the U.S., is prone to occasional recessions and contractions. The regional economy is particularly dependent on the technology and real estate sectors, which are prone to particularly dramatic boom-bust cycles. Given large income disparities and the City\u2019s revenue structure, these economic crises have a tendency to impact the most vulnerable residents while simultaneously reducing City resources to serve those residents. The City and region are also vulnerable to shocks related to international trade, travel, tourism, logistics, and manufacturing. Analysis from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that national economic contractions recur on approximately 7-year cycles.32 During the prior economic recession, the City\u2019s discretionary revenues were reduced by nearly 12 percent, while the demands for City services dramatically increased.\nR\nHISTORY OF OVERCOMING\nFrom the 1950s through the present, Castlemont and Eastmont have struggled with limited city resources, gang violence, and drug use.\nThe community\u2019s perseverence is a testament to resident resilience, different in nature than that of other neighborhoods.\n\u201cCrime.

To do so, we need to shift old paradigms and adopt new ways of doing the business of government.\nThe City of Oakland will focus on modernizing City processes by growing and supporting a culture of civic innovation built on data analysis, iterative processes, and human-centered service design. These methodologies ensure City programs and policies are designed around the needs and aspirations of Oakland residents, and are continuously optimized. Better data collection and analysis will foster improved evidence-based decision making. Human-centered, iterative design will help break down government silos, ensure that services are understandable and easy to use, and promote continuous process refinement to serve Oaklanders more effectively.\nTo achieve a more trustworthy and responsive government, we also need to empower our \u201centrepreneurial bureaucrats\u2019\u2019 to think outside the box while collaborating closely with community stakeholders. The City of Oakland boasts a passionate and mission-driven staff. Resilient Oakland engaged staff from nearly all City departments, led by a team of doers and innovators, to address interdisciplinary issues. To deepen resilience in their own work,\nCity staff developed the following guiding principles during this process:\n\u201cWe believe that success will come from the freedom to try new things in a culture that is not guided by apprehension, but rather allows us to pursue new opportunities and partnerships in nimble, flexible ways. Our work must be multidisciplinary and multilevel, engaging all facets of our organization working across agencies. We must accept and harness changes that are inevitable. We will use change as an opportunity to creatively adapt and better serve all residents. We will be responsive to the community and engage in two-way dialogue, which includes setting honest expectations and following through on commitments.\u201d\nThese principles provide a framework to move the City forward faster, in a more collaborative way, so we can tackle our resilience challenges quickly and more effectively.\n\u201cThe Bay Area needs a system of regional governance that can rise to the challenges of the 21st century.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe in designing beautiful & simple experiences.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we give people the power and privilege to be at the table?\u201d\n\u201cThe community is an institution itself...this isn\u2019t only our work,\nit\u2019s our life.\u201d\n\u201cSuccessful engagement includes facilitation that does\nnot favor anyone.\u201d\n\u201cThere is something that occurs when you\nown that you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cCommunity engagement is the baseline of government. Let\u2019s aim for community partnership.\u201d\nGOAL: DESIGN EQUITABLE AND MEASURABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\nThe City of Oakland will strengthen local democracy and governance by working on developing an inclusive, collaborative, and effective relationship built on trust between residents and government.\nAction: Develop principles for community engagement in Oakland\nAction: Pursue Partners for Places Equity Pilot to support ongoing collaborative engagement\nAction: Improve use of metrics to promote equitable outcomes\nGOAL: CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATIVE GOVERNMENT\nThe City of Oakland will foster an enterprise-wide movement towards continuous learning and improvement by developing repeatable, collaborative processes that transform the institution at its core, while leveraging regional resources for the benefit of Oakland residents.\nAction: Open a Civic Design Lab for problem solving across City departments in collaboration with partners\nAction: Implement integrated actions through Resilience Delivery Teams\nAction: Strengthen regional resilience through partnerships, programs, and pilots\nAction: Design a digital service center focused on public needs\nGOAL: APPLY DATA-DRIVEN PRINCIPLES TO INFORM DECISION-MAKING\nThe City of Oakland will work on transforming City government to a high-performing, continually improving, data-informed organization.\nAction: Measure performance to improve the City\u2019s resilience decision-making\nAction: Identify Key Performance Indicators for digital services, such as the Rent Adjustment Program\nGOAL: ENGAGE YOUTH IN SHAPING OAKLAND\u2019S FUTURE\nThe City of Oakland will engage youth to ensure they benefit from and shape the change and resilience they want to see in their communities.\nAction: Launch Y-PLAN Resiliency Challenge to support engagement with Oakland youth\nAction: Grow and support resilience internships through the Mayor\u2019s Classrooms2Careers Program\nAction: Educate Oakland youth about resilience issues and the future of Oakland through arts and storytelling\nGOAL: DESIGN EQUITABLE AND MEASURABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\nDEVELOP PRINCIPLES FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN OAKLAND\nDescription\nThe City of Oakland in partnership with Rebuild by Design, West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, and Streetwyze is developing new principles for community engagement to identify and address the needs of residents and communities. These principles are being developed through a collaborative process with City staff and community leaders in a series of workshops that examine the range of engagement strategies used, evaluate\ntheir effectiveness and limitations, and incorporate community-relevant metrics and benchmarks to measure the outcomes of community outreach and engagement tools and practices.\nThese workshops are being developed using a co-designed engagement process that will give the City the tools and relationships it needs to conduct better outreach, lead to an improved understanding of how the City can conduct more effective engagement in person and online, identify oppor-\ntunities and practices to include the community in the decision-making process, and establish applicable frameworks for discrete issues that can be iterated and replicated.\nThe four-workshop series is being co-designed and co-led by City staff and community partners, to focus on the following:\nWorkshop 1: Create a collective understanding of successful and unsuccessful engagement methods\nWorkshop 2: Understand common themes and create engagement principles\nWorkshop 3: Co-design an engagement strategy around an upcoming City project\nWorkshop 4: Evaluate and iterate the engagement strategy\nThe City of Oakland seeks to shift from a traditional, top-down \u201cinput and feedback\u2019\u2019 model of community engagement to a collaborative, problem-solving process through which residents are partners in making policy and implementing programs that address their needs. Applying community-identified principles of engagement and collaborative problem solving will cultivate trust among and between community and City staff. The principles can be applied to future offline and online engagement efforts, improve the relevance and effectiveness of City policies, and enable more responsive government\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tExpands and deepens community engagement\u2014already underway in various efforts throughout\nthe City of Oakland\u2014in terms of resiliency, climate action, land use, transportation, economic development, housing, public spaces, cultural arts, and social equity.\n\u25ba\tSupports workshops\/trainings that help develop a framework for equitable engagement among City staff and equitable action plans between the City and the community.\n\u25ba\tBuilds civic capacity by using both digital and in-person community engagement tools, such as surveys or participatory budgeting.\nUltimately, the goal is to better answer the question: How can we most smoothly create a positive feedback loop between community input and service delivery particularly in communities that are traditionally less engaged than others?\nLead: City Administrator\u2019s Office\nPartners: Rebuild By Design,\nWest Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, Streetwyze Timeframe: Fall 2016\nRelated goals: Create more opportunities for collaborative government; Engage youth in shaping the future of Oakland; Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods.\nChallenges Addressed:\nGOAL: DESIGN EQUITABLE AND\nMEASURABLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\nPURSUE PARTNERS FOR PLACES EQUITY PILOT GRANT TO SUPPORT ONGOING COLLABORATIVE ENGAGEMENT\nDescription\nThe City of Oakland is a member of the Urban Sustainability Directors\u2019 Network, which supports local sustainability and resilience efforts through networking, training, information sharing, and funding.

This framework could include collecting key metrics that can be used to track progress in improving outcomes for Oakland\u2019s most vulnerable residents. These metrics could include data across priority domains, such as Economy, Education, Health, Housing, Justice, and Services. EIP could then help the City establish baseline metrics and track changes annually. The City would be able to use data to understand which policies and programs are most effective in improving outcomes for disadvantaged Oakland residents and should therefore be expanded, and where new initiatives are most needed.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba Helps the City identify and prioritize the areas in which the City\u2019s efforts to tackle inequity have been successful and where additional initiatives are needed to address inequalities among specific disadvantaged populations.\nLead: City Administrator\u2019s Office\nPartners: Institute for State and Local Governance at the City University of New York, Rockefeller Foundation, 100 Resilient Cities\nTimeframe: Near-term (1 to 2 years) Funding: Rockefeller Foundation\nRelated goals: Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods; Increase economic security.

The City of Oakland, with pro bono support from Data Eaters (a team of data analysts), researched current database integrities and discrepancies, as well as principles of data analysis methods used in the field of resilience building. This research revealed the need for a Data Governance Plan to assist in the development and maturity of data programs, including systems that reside on City-owned servers managed by Information Technology Division staff, as well as systems hosted by external entities.\nOakland\u2019s Data Governance Plan aims to:\n\u25ba\tEnable better decision making;\n\u25ba\tReduce operational friction;\n\u25ba\tProtect the needs of data stakeholders;\n\u25ba\tTrain management and staff to adopt common approaches to data issues;\n\u25ba\tBuild standard, repeatable processes;\n\u25ba\tReduce costs and increase effectiveness through coordination of efforts; and\n\u25ba\tEnsure transparency of processes.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents:\n\u25ba\tIncreased awareness of the data programs and the type of data collected.\n\u25ba\tImproved data system documentation that accurately captures the extent and type of data collected.\n\u25ba\tImprovements in data consistency and quality.\n\u25ba\tClear set of definitions, policies, and procedures designed to streamline the management of the data systems and address redundant and inconsistent data.\nLead: City Administrator\u2019s Office Partners: Data Eaters Timeframe: Spring 2017\nFunding: Pro bono support\nfrom Data Eaters\nRelated goals: Design equitable and measurable community engagement; Increase economic security; Reduce current future climate and seismic risks; Provide urban greening for neighborhoods most in need; Maximize value of collective infrastructure investments Challenges Addressed:\nGOAL: APPLY DATA-DRIVEN PRINCIPLES TO INFORM DECISION-MAKING\nIDENTIFY KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR DIGITAL SERVICES, SUCH AS THE RENT ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM\nDescription\nMeasuring performance is key to meeting service delivery goals. For instance, as part of the digital work supporting the Rent Adjustment Program, we will start to create a performance framework (e.g., guidelines that outline the service\u2019s objectives and explain what data our team should gather to meet them); estimate the number of people you expect to use the service; determine the analytics tools already in use and whether they are suitable for the type and volume of data we\u2019re expecting; determine where existing data is kept and how to access it, aggregate it, and make it usable to measure our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\nBy identifying a KPI for the digital service improvement for the Rent Adjustment Program, we seek to ensure that:\n\u25ba\tThe service is meeting residents\u2019 needs;\n\u25ba\tThe service allows residents to easily complete the task;\n\u25ba\tThere are enough people using the service to make it cost-efficient; and\n\u25ba\tPeople know about the service and choose to use it.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents:\n\u25ba Helps to ensure City services are meeting residents\u2019 needs.\nLead: City Administrator\u2019s Office, Chief Resilience Officer Partners: TBD Timeframe: Spring 2017 Funding: N\/A\nRelated goals: Use data to drive decisions Challenges Addressed:\nGOAL: ENGAGE YOUTH IN SHAPING THE FUTURE OF OAKLAND\nLAUNCH Y-PLAN RESILIENCY CHALLENGE TO SUPPORT ENGAGEMENT WITH OAKLAND YOUTH\nDescription\nThe City will launch the Youth-Plan, Learn, Act, Now!

To fulfill the vision of Oakland as one of the healthiest and safest cities in the United States, the Plan focuses on three goals: 1) thriving youth and families, 2) safe neighborhoods, and 3) restorative city. These goals range from providing educational, employment, and cultural opportunities for youth most vulnerable to becoming victims or perpetrators of violence, to accounting for historical inequities and injustices that have led to current conditions of violence and trauma. The Plan will create a common framework for collective accountability, aligning the resources of the City, Oakland Unified School District and Alameda County with other government agencies, community-based organizations and philanthropy. For each goal developed, the City will explore setting Key Performance Indicators to track progress using open data, and will collaborate with City and County stakeholders, community partners, and other members to discuss intent, additional opportunities, and implementation.\nFRIDAY:\nteacher\nSTRUCT)\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tIncreases pathways to success for all young people in Oakland.\n\u25ba\tImproves housing stability and increases economic stability for families.\n\u25ba\tLeads to improved response times and ratings for police services through community and resident surveys.\nLead: Office of the Mayor\nPartners: Alameda County, Oakland Unified School District Timeframe: Fall 2016 Funding: Fully funded\nGOAL: PROMOTE SAFE AND HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS\nPROMOTE RESILIENCE AND EQUITY FOR OAKLAND\u2019S HIGH-RISK YOUTH AND ADULTS MOST AFFECTED BY TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE\nDescription\nOakland\u2019s Resiliency in Communities After Stress and Trauma (ReCAST) program seeks to promote resiliency and equity for Oakland\u2019s high-risk youth and adults most affected by trauma and violence.

The City will continue to seek to partner with, and build the resilience of, those communities.\nAction:\tDemonstrate the retrofit of a city block using Ecoblock principles\nAction:\tImplement the 2016 Update to the Energy and Climate Action Plan\nAction:\tDesign and implement a soft-story retrofit program\nAction:\tImplement the Preliminary Sea Level Rise Road Map\nAction:\tImplement high-priority actions from the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan\nAction:\tAssess equity impacts and feasibility of 100-percent clean and renewable energy\nAction:\tImprove community resilience through risk modeling\nGOAL: PROVIDE URBAN GREENING FOR NEIGHBORHOODS MOST IN NEED\nGreen infrastructure can bring many benefits to communities\u2014beyond protecting and improving water quality entering storm drains, and providing compliance with Federal and State regulations. Oakland is eager to increase the use of green infrastructure to provide additional benefits, such as improved air quality, reduced urban heat island effect, creating habitat, and improving the experience of the public realm. These are especially important benefits for neighborhoods that have historically lacked access to parks, creeks, and street trees.\nAction: Identify and leverage funding opportunities for Priority Conservation Areas\nAction: Update the Storm Drainage Master Plan to guide future investment in stormwater management\nAction: Prioritize parks and open spaces using resilience-related criteria\nAction: Develop a Green Infrastructure Plan to improve social, environmental, and economic resilience outcomes\nWhile the City is seeking a $600M bond measure in November 2016 for housing and community infrastructure (Measure KK), the level of infrastructure investment that Oakland envisions cannot be achieved with traditional investment tools alone. Oakland will explore and pilot innovative financing mechanisms, and apply the lessons learned from those pilots more broadly. The City will explore how to best leverage the City\u2019s budget to partner with residents, businesses, and other organizations to achieve our goals.\nAction: Apply a resilience, mobility, and equity lens to assess and select capital improvement projects\nAction: Explore participation in County\u2019s Community Choice Aggregation program\nAction: Explore innovative financing tools for resilience projects, including EcoBlocks\nGOAL: REDUCE CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS\nDEMONSTRATE THE RETROFIT OF A CITY BLOCK USING ECOBLOCK PRINCIPLES\nDescription\nThe EcoBlock project team will work in close collaboration with the owners and residents of a small, older residential neighborhood to retrofit an entire North Oakland block that includes approximately 30 older homes, many subdivided into two to three smaller units. The project will include implementing deep energy efficiency in all homes and shared rooftop solar panel, creating a solar-powered microgrid with smart controls and onsite energy storage that can operate autonomously.\nElectricity generated on site will be sufficient to power electric vehicle chargers, which may serve as a shared resource for the community. The EcoBlock will drive significant water conservation through rooftop water harvesting and advanced technologies to treat and recycle water onsite. Recycled water will irrigate shared organic fruit and vegetable gardens and landscaping to keep the block lush and mitigate the urban heat-island effect.\nThe EcoBlock will serve as a prototype, in the hopes that it can be replicated\nacross the nation to transform low- to moderate-income neighborhoods to be solar-powered, zero-carbon, and drought-tolerant, while reducing stress on the electric grid and the wastewater treatment system.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba Promotes environmental justice by proving the feasibility and scalability of transforming the city\u2019s residential blocks into neighborhoods that are energy and water secure and resilient.\nLead: UC Berkeley, Chief Resilience Officer, Public Works Department, Planning and Building Department\nPartners: Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, Stanford University, and NASA\nLaunch Timeframe: Near-term (2 years) for planning and policy development; medium (3 to 5 years) for building\nFunding: The project was awarded an initial $1,500,000 planning grant by the California Energy Commission.

The revised ECAP will set priorities for the remaining period leading up to the 2020 goal year and establish the baseline on which a 2030 ECAP will be predicated.\nOakland\u2019s ECAP, adopted by Council in 2012, was written with extraordinary community engagement. It contains 175 action items across five thematic areas (Building Energy Use, Transportation and Land Use, Materials Use and Waste, Community Engagement, and Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change), 61 of which were three-year priorities. The ECAP aims to achieve a 36 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to 2005 levels by 2020.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tRevives community engagement in and familiarity with local and citywide resilience and sustainability issues.\n\u25ba\tRe-establishes a sense of community ownership over the city\u2019s efforts to simultaneously combat and adapt to climate change.\n\u25ba\tEnsures that environmental justice remains a centerpiece of the City\u2019s climate agenda.\nLead: Public Works Department\nPartners: All City departments;\nChief Resilience Officer, Oakland Climate Action Coalition and other engaged community organizations, business leaders, especially cleantech, green, and small businesses.\nTimeframe: Near-term (1 year) for planning and medium-term (4 years) for ongoing implementation\nFunding: ECAP implementation is dependent on diverse ongoing funding for a wide array of actions.\nRelated goals: Create more opportunities for collaborative government; Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods; Provide urban greening for neighborhoods most in need. Challenges Addressed:\nGOAL: REDUCE CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A SOFT STORY RETROFIT PROGRAM\nDescription\nOakland is developing a program that will provide limited financial support to owners of soft-story apartment buildings for seismic retrofits. This program will help the City enhance interdepartmental coordination and pilot streamlined processes to expedite soft-story retrofits. Simultaneously, the City will continue to explore policy tools, such as a retrofit ordinance, that would more effectively mitigate the hazard posed by un-retrofitted soft-story buildings.Soft-story apartment buildings are at particular risk of structural damage or even collapse from an earthquake due to a lack of adequate strength in their first story. They account for approximately 22,000 housing units in Oakland.\nTo enroll eligible properties in this pilot program, the City will explore ways to reach out to owners of soft-story apartment buildings at risk of earthquake damage, including working with rental housing associations, print and media advertising, and direct mail to owners of eligible buildings identified during the City\u2019s preliminary screening.\nIn addition to the soft-story retrofit program, which targets apartment buildings of five or more units,\nOakland also received FEMA grant funding to provide financial assistance to owner-occupants for seismic retrofits of one to four unit homes. Benefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba Helps prevent human injury, loss of life, and damage to or loss of housing\nunits and reduce costs associated with these negative impacts.\n\u25ba\tReduces displacement and keeps residents in their homes following a major earthquake, helping to preserve Oakland\u2019s diversity and reduce the costs of rapidly rehousing displaced residents.\n\u25ba\tReduces recovery time from an earthquake as residents in stable housing can more readily return to jobs and schools and contribute to the local economy.\nLead: Housing and Community Development Department\nPartners: Planning and Building Department, FEMA, California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services.\nTimeframe: Outreach and compile master list of eligible properties from October 2016 to March 2017. Plan check, construction, and inspections from April 2017 to September 2019.\nFunding: The City has received $117,500 from FEMA for Phase I of the program, which will include outreach to owners of eligible properties, establishment of a master inventory list, and collection of owner consent agreements. Phase II funding, up to $2,882,500 for construction and program implementation, will be approved by FEMA if Phase I demonstrates that the program is eligible.\nRelated goals: Increase economic security; Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods; Maximize the value of\nts\nGOAL: REDUCE CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS\nIMPLEMENT THE PRELIMINARY SEA LEVEL RISE ROAD MAP\nDescription\nThrough the resilience strategy development process, Oakland has developed a Preliminary Sea Level Rise (SLR) Road Map, which includes priority coordination and adaptation actions to guide the City\u2019s work in the near-term (through 2018).\nThe document seeks to:\n\u25ba\tSummarize the most up-to-date climate science, relevant policies and regulations, and vulnerability and risk assessments conducted to date;\n\u25ba\tIdentify information gaps and establish needs for further assessment;\n\u25ba\tProvide the foundation and guidance to develop a citywide SLR adaptation plan; and\n\u25ba\tIdentify opportunities for engagement, collaboration, and coordination\nPriority actions are grouped in the cate gories of: (1) community engagement and collaboration, (2) regional coordination, (3) understanding neighborhood vulnerabilities, and (4) enabling climate-smart development. There are a total of 22 actions in the Road Map, three of which are featured below.\nCommunicate SLR Risks\nto the Community\nAs also identified in the Energy and Climate Action Plan (ECAP), the City will engage with the Oakland community about SLR impacts, laying the foundation for public discussion of future planning decisions and adaptation strategies. In partnership with local community groups, the City will seek to communicate information about SLR impacts to the Oakland community, particularly those who may be most vulnerable, such as communities of color and low-income communities. Near-term opportunities include the ECAP Update, Plan Downtown Oakland outreach, and CORE and Neighbors Helping Neighbors programs.\nEnable and Use\nCommunity-Generated Data\nThe City will seek opportunities for residents to provide additional information critical to SLR mapping efforts, including factors affecting localized flooding, such as areas of illegal dumping, infrastructure conditions, and unique neighborhood attributes. This activity could be facilitated through a partnership with a digital provider so community partners can map neighbor-hood-specific conditions for inclusion in SLR adaptation plans and actions.\nIdentify Funding to Complete Citywide Vulnerability and Risk Assessment\nEast Oakland and the Coliseum Area have undergone vulnerability assessments as part of the Adapting to Rising Tides Program. In addition, the Port will be assessing its maritime facilities, and developing an implementation plan for near- and long-term SLR adaptation strategies. Additional community areas such as West Oakland, the Central Estuary, and Jack London Square are also vulnerable and in need of similar assessments. The City will identify funding to complete vulnerability and risk assessments for vulnerable areas and assets that have not yet been studied. The City will seek to partner with the Oakland Climate Action Coalition\nand other local groups to ensure that residents in Oakland\u2019s vulnerable communities are engaged in the vulnerability assessment process. In addition, the City will collaborate with all appropriate local, County, and regional agencies. Benefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tIncreases opportunities for residents to learn about the potential impacts of SLR on local neighborhoods and more effectively plan for personal impacts during storm events.\n\u25ba\tStrengthens communication between and among residents and the City regarding critical safety issues, and facilitate greater participation among the community in developing solutions.\n\u25ba\tHelps ensure that the City and other agencies are taking a coordinated and proactive approach to SLR adaptation and planning.\nLead: Planning and Building\nDepartment, Public Works Department, Chief Resilience Officer\nPartners: Many partners, including San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, Bay Area Regional Collaborative, Alameda County Flood Control District, Oakland Climate Action Coalition, Resilient Communities Initiative, Port of Oakland, East Bay Regional Park District,\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, Pacific Institute, among others.

Mitigation strategies in the LHMP include retrofitting building and facilities to reduce earthquake risks, infrastructure improvements to reduce temporary flooding and permanent inundation, fire prevention strategies, and emergency planning and preparedness. These mitigation strategies seek to reduce potential damage to infrastructure and the dislocation and disruption to Oaklanders' lives resulting from a hazard. In addition, the LHMP seeks to ensure that all future Specific Plans and General Plan updates include an analysis of projected sea level rise and other hazards that are projected to become more extreme as a result of climate change, and where necessary, incorporate appropriate mitigation strategies.\nThe plan recognizes that climate change threatens Oakland with both discrete shocks (coastal floods, increased wildfire risks) and continual or periodic stresses (rising seas and droughts). Oakland\u2019s low-income residents, communities of color, the elderly, and children may be disproportionately vulnerable to these increasing threats. Benefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tReduces the loss of life and property from hazards.\n\u25ba\tImproves recovery time in the event of a disaster and safeguards Oakland\u2019s economic welfare, reducing dislocation and disruption.\n\u25ba Preserves environmental quality by minimizing damage to natural resources from identified hazards.\nLead: The implementation of actions will be led by various departments, including Planning and Building Department, Public Works Department, Fire Department (Emergency Management Services Division) and the Port of Oakland\nPartners: Federal Emergency Management Agency, State of California Office of Emergency Services , Association of Bay Area Governments Timeframe: 2016 to 2021\nFunding: Oakland is seeking funding to implement several of the mitigation strategies\nRelated goals: Promoting safe and healthy neighborhoods; Provide urban greening for neighborhoods most in need; Maximize value of collective infrastructure investments\nGOAL: REDUCE CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS\nASSESS EQUITY IMPACTS AND FEASIBILITY OF 100-PERCENT CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY\nDescription\nThe City of Oakland is working with community based organizations, philanthropies, nonprofits, and the Urban Sustainability Directors Network to assess the equity impacts of transitioning to a 100-percent electricity supply provided by renewable energy.\nA future powered by renewable energy has the potential to lower greenhouse gases and mitigate against the potentially devastating consequences of climate change. However, the transition to this future must be managed in ways that address historic inequities in the way energy is provided. This includes the impacts associated with the siting of renewable energy facilities such as solar photovoltaic and geothermal systems, the cost implications for low-income households, and the workforce impacts of transitioning from existing power sources. Additional issues will likely arise as community groups discuss the issue and identify the ways in which energy affects the lives of people of color and low income communities. This work remains in early stage, as the City and its partners seek additional financing, organizational alignment, and strategy guidance. Benefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tThis assessment has the potential to increase equity conditions\nfor all residents by proactively addressing impacts on this issue.\n\u25ba\tImplementation of the assessment may improve economic and job development prospects, reduce the potential for inequities in siting energy facilities, and increase fairness in the delivery of new\ntechnologies, improvements, and infrastructure related to energy.\nLead: Public Works Department,\nChief Resilience Officer, and community-based organizations\nPartners: Sierra Club, Solutions Project Center for Social Inclusion, Urban Sustainability Directors Network, foundations, and philanthropies\nTimeframe: Near-term (1 to 2 years) for analysis, coordination, and solution development\nFunding: Oakland was selected as part of a Kresge-funded study of equity impacts in renewable energy in 2016. Additional studies funding City and community-based organizations are being pursued.\nRelated goals: Increase economic security; Promote safe\nIMPROVE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE THROUGH RISK MODELING\nDescription\nThe City of Oakland will explore launching a pilot project to more effectively integrate risk assessment and mitigation planning resources into the larger array of community planning processes. This will include working with the community to identify appropriate \u201cpoints of intervention\u2019\u2019 for the integration of relevant models, tools, and methods into the local planning process. Efforts will be made to ensure that a reasonable number of community planning examples are used in order to capture a sufficient range of points of intervention and subsequent strategies relevant to all applicable planning areas. The end result is to identify opportunities for identifying and reducing hazard risks in support of the overall mission of supporting community resilience.\nExample 1: Integrate new risk reduction models, tools, and methods into existing plans such as the General Plan, neighborhood and area plans, green infrastructure planning processes, etc., as may be appropriate.\nExample 2: Introduce approaches that can be \u201cbanked\u2019\u2019 for integrating into the next 5-year hazard mitigation plan update.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\nCity staffers, stakeholders, partners, and residents of the City of Oakland and Alameda County will benefit from an increased awareness of the models, tools, and methods available to enhance community resilience.\nThese resources will be used to further integrate risk reduction principles and practices into a wide array of existing community planning processes. Specific opportunities may include tools for environmental justice, green infrastructure, and any perceived \u201cgaps\u201d in local planning resources.\nLead: Chief Resilience Officer\nPartners: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy Development and Research; American Planning Association; Association of State Floodplain Managers; National Association of Counties; AECOM Timeframe: Fall 2016\nFunding: Paid for by the\npartners listed above\nRelated goals: Apply data-driven principles to inform decision-making; Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods; Provide urban greening for neighborhoods most in need Challenges Addressed:\nIDENTIFY AND LEVERAGE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRIORITY CONSERVATION AREAS\nDescription\nThe City and its community partners will seek to identify and leverage funding opportunities for investing in Priority Conservation Areas (PCAs) using the equity checklist adopted by City Council resolution and developed by the Oakland Climate Action Coalition, as a framework for prioritization. City staff will work with community leaders to develop a formal community engagement process for prioritizing projects and allocating funding, which will be informed by the work done under Action: Develop principles for community engagement in Oakland.\nPCAs are prioritized by regional agencies for targeted investments in parks, urban greening, nature preservation and rehabilitation, recreation activities, planning efforts, and other programs. A recent update to Plan Bay Area34 has allowed PCAs to be designated to provide funding opportunities for urban greening which includes, creek and habitat protection, use of plants and soil to treat stormwater and improving food sources in urban environments.\nThe designation of Oakland\u2019s PCAs had significant contribution from community stakeholders, including neighborhoods challenged by environmental impacts, food access, and parks deficits.\nMeasure AA, the \u201cSan Francisco Bay Clean Water, Pollution Prevention and Habitat Restoration Program,\u2019\u2019is\nalso a potential funding opportunity for possible Oakland PCA projects. Measure AA is projected to raise about $25 million per year to restore wetlands and protect shorelines throughout the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. Benefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tGenerates investment in parks, open space, creek restoration, rain gardens, green streets and other forms of urban greening.\n\u25ba\tPromotes cohesive and engaged communities.\n\u25ba\tEnsures that City planners have a more complete picture of the conservation, restoration, and environmental justice needs of disadvantaged communities.\n\u25ba\tIncreases equity in allocation of climate and resilience resources.\nLead: Public Works Department, Planning and Building Department, Chief Resilience Officer\nPartners: Oakland Climate Action Coalition, Association of Bay Area Governments, San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority Timeframe: Near-term (1 to 3 years)\nFunding: The City and partners will seek funding guided by the equity checklist, including Measure AA grants\nRelated goals: Increase eco-\nnomic security; Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods\nUPDATE THE STORM DRAINAGE MASTER PLAN TO GUIDE FUTURE INVESTMENT IN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT\nDescription\nThe City of Oakland will develop an updated Storm Drainage Master Plan (SDMP) that will include a comprehensive asset management system and state-of-the art modeling that evaluates how the system performs under different storm scenarios and incorporates precipitation changes and sea level rise due to climate change. The City\u2019s existing 2006 SDMP, has fallen out of date and the storm drainage system is in critical need of maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. The SDMP will be used to identify critical maintenance and improvement projects that will reduce potentially costly and dangerous flooding. The updated SDMP aims to be a living document that is continuously updated as a vital tool for guiding investment in the City\u2019s storm drainage system.\nBecause of the topography of Oakland, flooding hotspots typically coincide with low-income neighborhoods.\nThe City will explore using an equity checklist to guide the project prioritization process, potentially overlaying socio-economic data with modeling on flooding hotspots and other known stormwater problem areas. As described in the Oakland Preliminary Sea Level Rise Road Map, the City will also seek opportunities for residents of Oakland neighborhoods to provide information on factors affecting localized flooding. This activity could be facilitated through a partnership with an online engagement platform, so community members can map hot spots for creek or coastal-caused flooding they are already experiencing in their neighborhoods.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba Neighborhoods and streets are less likely to flood during storm events, reducing the risk of damage to homes, injury, or disruption to transit or daily routines.\nLead: Public Works Department\nPartners: Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District Timeframe: Near-term (1 to 2 years)\nFunding: Public Works Department is working to identify a funding source\nRelated goals: Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods; Apply data-driven principles to decision-making; Maximize the impact of collective infrastructure investment Challenges Addressed:\nPRIORITIZE PARKS AND OPEN SPACES USING RESILIENCE-RELATED CRITERIA\nDescription\nThe City is developing conceptual plans and budgets for approximately 20 Parks and Open Space projects (including park facilities) as part of a Parks Project Prioritization Development program. The plan will allow the City to define scopes and complete preliminary design and cost estimates for projects, which is instrumental in positioning the City for grant opportunities. The sites will be evaluated against a range of resilience related criteria including equity, health and safety, environmental and economic performance, and operation and maintenance feasibility.\nCommunity engagement will be an integral part of the process. The Office of Parks and Recreation (OPR) holds annual feedback sessions with communities throughout the City and receives feedback from the public who provides input through Council Offices about local parks and recreational facilities. Staff maintains communication with numerous community groups and non-profit organizations, such as Oakland Park Coalition, Oakland Parks and Recreation Foundation, Measure DD Coalition, to understand the priorities and concerns. Having the Park Project Prioritization list has allowed community groups to support and focus on priorities as well as partner with the City to implement some of the projects. During the project development process, consultants will work with staff to incorporate limited outreach to users for input in\ndetermining project scopes. When project funds are obtained, expanded outreach and design confirmation and refinement will be incorporated as part of the project implementation process. Benefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tGreater impact and benefit of investments in park improvement projects.\n\u25ba\tImproved access to park and recreation facilities.\nLead: Public Works Department\nPartners: Parks and Recreation Department, Oakland Parks and Recreation Foundation\nTimeframe: Plan will be\ncomplete in early 2017\nFunding: General Fund (funded); implementation of the projects could be funded through Measure KK (potential infrastructure bond). This Bond will ask voters in November 2016 to invest as much as $600M in safer streets and sidewalks, improved libraries and parks, and upgrades to Oakland\u2019s public safety buildings and fire stations\u2014to renovate them, make them more environmentally sustainable and less costly to maintain. In addition, the City can leverage the bond fund for potential capital improvement funds such as grants, foundations, donations, and state bonds.\nRelated goals: Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods; Use data to drive decisions; Maximize the impact of collective infrastructure investment. Challenges Addressed:\nGOAL: PROVIDE URBAN GREENING FOR NEIGHBORHOODS MOST IN NEED\nDEVELOP A GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN TO IMPROVE SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL,\nAND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES\nDescription\nGreen infrastructure (Gl) is an approach to stormwater management that protects, restores, or mimics the natural water cycle. In addition to improving San Francisco Bay water quality, Gl provides co-benefits such as the creation\/ protection of open space, reduced urban heat-island effect, improved air quality, and reduced flood risks. The City is developing a Gl Plan to identify areas of opportunity and standards for inclusion of Gl in public capital projects, such as streetscape renovations, parks projects, and parking lot retrofits. Opportunity areas for Gl projects will be informed by multiple criteria, such as ability to meet regulatory requirements, cost efficiency, space availability, and equity considerations. Not only will the Gl Plan ensure that the City complies with Clean Water Act\nrequirements, it will also be a multi-faceted guide for the City\u2019s Gl efforts.\nThe City is also exploring the development of an integrated project development process as a part of this plan to help integrate Gl into City plans and to enhance effective communication between departments, and vertically between the City Council, Office of the Mayor, Department of Transportation, and Planning and Engineering and Operations. The process would include the following actions:\n\u25ba Creating a Resilience Delivery Team for design review: this would be a multi-discipline, cross-departmental group comprised of internal staff members (including planners, environmental, maintenance\/ operations, etc.) that will review projects during their early development phase for Gl opportunities;\n\u25ba\tDeveloping a detailed project checklist: this would illustrate the entire typical project development cycle steps, including: funding sources\/conditions, planning, design, construction and O&M; and including actions available that will act to ease integration of Gl features into a range of project types; and\n\u25ba\tPreparing design and implementation guidance for inclusion of green infrastructure in transportation projects. May be incorporated as a chapter in Oakland\u2019s Complete Streets Plan.\nAs part of this process, the City will also seek funding to develop an Urban Forestry Master Plan (UFMP), which would include an overall tree planting goal and annual target, to expand the urban forest and provide a variety of benefits, including improving air quality and carbon sequestration. As part of the UFMP, the City will look for opportunities to incorporate stormwater tree wells into tree planting areas to maximize the benefits that could be achieved through the planting of additional trees.\nThe City will also explore using digital cost-benefit tools to demonstrate the triple bottom line (economic, social, and environmental) benefits of Gl projects. For example, AutoCASE is useful for determining triple bottom line returns associated with infrastructure projects at sizes ranging from small (e.g., $500,000) to extremely large ($1 billion+). Including the valuation of sustainability benefits, in additional to more traditional financial returns, can help the City maximize the benefits of its investments in grey and green infrastructure for Oakland\u2019s residents and businesses.

The legislation requires the City to consider four areas when choosing bond funded projects: 1) social and geographic equity, 2) how projects address the City\u2019s core capital assets, 3) how projects maintain or decrease existing operation and maintenance costs, and 4) how projects address energy consumption, mobility, and resilience.\nAdditionally, as the City conducts its biennial Capital Improvement Plan, the City will explore establishing an integrated and holistic Resilience Delivery Team that builds City\u2019s capacity to:\n\u25ba\tAim for equitable outcomes;\n\u25ba\tLeverage actions across a broad group of stakeholders;\n\u25ba\tConsider cross-jurisdictional implications (i.e., intercity, regional, national, global);\n\u25ba\tConsider impacts of multiple shocks and stresses identified through a broad risk and hazard assessment; and\n\u25ba\tAim for short, medium, and long-term triple bottom line benefits including economic, environmental, and social goals.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tEnsures equity in the capital improvement planning process.\n\u25ba Integrates planning processes to achieve multiple benefits, including climate action and other resilience activities to help the City and its partners fulfill Oakland\u2019s resilience goals more holistically in the short and long term.\nLead: City of Oakland\nPartners: Oakland community organizations, Rebuild by Design Timeframe: Launch Fall 2016 Funding: Internal and external resources\nRelated goals:Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods; Promote urban greening for neighborhoods most in need; Apply data-driven principles to decision-making Challenges Addressed:\nSUPPORT ESTABLISHING A JOINT POWERS AGENCY FOR COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM\nDescription\nAlameda County, with input from its cities, is considering forming a Joint Powers Agency (JPA) to purchase and sell electricity to its residents and businesses as a Community Choice Aggregator (CCA), under the name East Bay Community Energy.\nThis program would allow East Bay Community Energy to serve as the provider of electricity for the residents and businesses of each city and county that chooses to participate. East Bay Community Energy would increase the amount of renewable energy provided to residents, lowering the carbon footprint of homes and businesses.\nThe CCA program is designed to create equity in delivering clean energy. To ensure that the community\u2019s voice is reflected in the JPA, a Community Advisory Board has been established with its head serving as a non-voting member on the JPA Board of Directors. The CCA's feasibility study gave specific analysis of the impact of the CCA on creating local solar jobs. CCA\u2019s have the ability to create local programs to support electric vehicles, energy efficiency upgrades, and other projects that replace aging infrastructure in Oakland. By focusing on local clean energy projects, East Bay Community Energy could also spur local job growth, with estimates between 160 to 455 average annual jobs in the construction sector, and 752 to 1,617 total average annual jobs in the County. The JPA further provides a priority for prevailing wage and union jobs.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba\tLowers electricity bills and reduces greenhouse gas emissions for the entire community, and supports Oakland\u2019s equitable transition\nto a clean energy economy.\n\u25ba\tCreates hundreds of local jobs, including in the construction sector\nLead: City of Oakland\nPartners: Oakland community organizations, Rebuild by Design Timeframe: Launch Fall 2016 Funding: N\/A\nRelated goals: Promote safe and healthy neighborhoods;Promote urban greening for neighborhoods most in need; Apply data-driven principles to decision-making Challenges Addressed:\nEXPLORE INNOVATIVE FINANCING TOOLS FOR RESILIENCE PROJECTS, INCLUDING ECOBLOCKS\nDescription\nAny innovative resilient project or initiative will require new thinking around how to leverage assets and financial tools to make it sustainable. Oakland\u2019s resilience depends on the ability to reliably finance adaptation to a rapidly changing and complex future.\nAs part of the EcoBlock project, the City is working with the State Treasurer\u2019s Office, UC Berkeley, and other public finance experts to explore innovative business and financing models, such as eco-Community Facilities Districts or other types of financing districts. The purpose is to finance and scale deployment of clean and renewable technologies and seismic retrofits to adapt Oakland\u2019s housing sector. As part of the EcoBlock project, the City and project partners will develop new financing frameworks and tools to scale of EcoBlock throughout Oakland and beyond.\nBenefits to Oakland Residents\n\u25ba Enabling City staff to pursue traditional and nontraditional financing for climate action and other resilience activities will help the City and its partners fulfill Oakland\u2019s resilience goals faster and more sustainably.\nLead: City Administrator\u2019s Office\nPartners: State Treasurer\u2019s\nOffice, UC Berkeley\nTimeframe: Fall 2017\nFunding: N\/A\nRelated goals: Apply data-driven principles for decision making; Provide urban greening for neighborhoods most in need; Reduce current and future climate and seismic risks Challenges Addressed:\nAPPENDIX A: DEVELOPING THE RESILIENT OAKLAND PLAYBOOK\nDeveloping Resilient Oakland has been a demanding two-year process due to the range of immediate and long-term economic, social and environmental challenges facing Oakland. The strategy development has involved the participation of many City staff across different departments, regional agencies, and members of local community organizations.\nThe first phase of the process led to the\nPreliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA),\nwhich reviewed Oakland\u2019s existing level\nof resilience and identified high-priority\nareas for future study as part of the\nsecond phase. The PRA development\nprocess involved a number of distinct\nexercises engaging a cross-departmental\nCity working team to ensure the breadth\nand depth of current resilience efforts,\nas well as current risks faced by the City\nand community, were understood and\ndocumented. The process included a\nday-long event held in March 2015 to\nlaunch Resilient Oakland and the 2015\nCommunity Resilience Challenge led by\nBay Localize, now Rooted in Resilience.\nThis gave over 120 participants invited\nfrom local community groups, regional\norganizations and City departments\nthe opportunity to hear from speakers\non some of Oakland\u2019s main resilience\nchallenges, such as social and economic inequity (from Urban Strategies Council), food equity and access to basic needs (from the Food Policy Council), housing (from Causa Justa and City of Oakland) and sea level rise (from the Bay Conservation and Development Commission). Participants also took part in an interactive working session to identify, prioritize and then rate the most important factors that contribute to a more resilient Oakland.\nA key output of the PRA was identifying five discovery areas around\nwhich the second phase of work was focused, with the goal of iden-\ntifying actions that could help build a more resilient Oakland:\n\u25ba\tProsperous Residents and Families: Promote the prosperity of residents and families through a more coordinated and comprehensive approach to increasing access to good jobs, building wealth, and fostering economic development.\n\u25ba\tStaying Rooted in Oakland: Identify what long-term residents of Oakland (especially the most vulnerable) need to be able to stay and what new residents need to be able to integrate in a way that preserves and reinforces community character.\n\u25ba\tLiving in Safe and Secure Neighborhoods: Identify innovative approaches for reducing violent crime and building community trust in law enforcement and justice.\n\u25ba\tBenefiting from Public Infrastructure: Identify which public infrastructure projects will have the most impact on resilience and determine how they should be coordinated, sequenced, and financed.\n\u25ba\tRecovering Quickly from Adversity: Identify what Oakland\u2019s most vulnerable residents need to build their personal and community resilience.\nIntegral to the work within each of these discovery areas was to consider how Oakland should redefine how it engages with the community, works across City departments, and uses data in its everyday work. Consequently, creating the Resilient Oakland playbook involved a number of working group meetings around each of these discovery areas to define potential actions for inclusion.\nKey meetings included:\n\u25ba\tA workshop bringing together landlords, tenants, City staff facilitated by frog design to identify opportunities for improving the Rent Adjustment Program\n\u25ba\tTwo meetings of a sea level rise working group to review current sea level rise activities and contribute to the development of a sea level rise road map to help Oakland become better prepared now for future sea level rise\n\u25ba\tAn interdepartmental meeting to consider current barriers and opportunities to integrating more green infrastructure into underserved areas of the city\n\u25ba\tA meeting to evaluate progress to date and to update the Energy and Climate Action Plan\n\u25ba\tA series of workshops by West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, Streetwyze, the City and Rebuild by Design to collaborate on how to develop a new mode of community engagement for the City of Oakland and its residents\n\u25ba\tMeetings with IHS Markit and staff from City departments to review economic development and workforce development data analysis and strategies\n\u25ba\tA meeting about data visualization with Oakland Police Department and Bayes Impact, as part of the City\u2019s Startup in Residence Program\n\u25ba\tMeetings with Greenlining and Urban Strategies Council to discuss financial inclusion data analysis and strategies\n\u25ba\tTwo Oakland Economic Security & Wealth Building Working Group meetings to discuss how to deepen the City\u2019s collective impact work in Oakland around economic resilience\n\u25ba\tA series of roundtables as part of Oakland Thrives run by the Youth Ventures Joint Powers Authority and leaders from the public, business, and nonprofit sectors, the faith community, and Oakland neighborhoods to take a cross-sec-tor collaborative approach to health, education, and wealth\/income for the long term well-being of Oakland\u2019s children, youth and their families\n\u25ba\tAn interdepartmental resilience visioning session facilitated by FSG underwritten by Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s 100 Resilient Cities\nAdditionally, the City of Oakland is grateful for the number of partners through the 100 Resilient Cities program and beyond which have provided over $750,000 worth of services (at no cost to the City) including IHS Markit, Rebuild by Design, Streetwyze, frog design, Impact Infra-structure\/Autodesk, Jump Associates, Vision Architecture, Data Eaters,\nAECOM and services still to be realized by Veolia and NOAA\/HUD.\nLOVE LETTER TO OAKLAND\nIn the spirit of staying rooted and thriving\nin a vibrant and connected city, Resilient\nOakland is also an invitation for all residents\nand organizations in the city to partner with\nCity government and other community leaders to build Oakland\u2019s resilience together.\nThere is no single action we can take that solves all of Oakland\u2019s challenges, but we can take coordinated, multi-disciplinary steps that address more than one challenge at once. As you review the Resilient Oakland Playbook, we invite you to identify opportunities for you to benefit from and contribute to the work. If you feel so inclined, you can give us direct feedback by filling out this letter.\nSend letters to:\nChief Resilience Officer\nOne Frank Ogawa Plaza, 3rd floor\nOakland, CA 94612\nor\nInstagram | \u00a9oaklandgov\nFacebook | \u00a9CityofOakland\nTwitter | \u00a9Oakland\nMedium | \u00a9Oakland\n#lttakesatown\nMoving forward, the City will continue to contribute to and learn from the practice of resilience that is being advanced through the 100RC Network, of which Oakland is honored to be a part. The City will continue to foster partnerships with resilience leaders in the region, including the Cities of Berkeley and San Francisco and the multitude of local resilience leaders in our community.","ENTITIES":{"ORGANIZATION":["Estuary Policy Plan","NASA","Alameda County Grand Jury","Bay Community Energy","NEED Green","Oakland Promise","Oakland Climate Action Coalition , Association

RESILIENT PITTSBURGH\nPittsburgh will be a resilient city when the entire community shares the same opportunities for prosperity, and when all residents are well cared for and prepared to face potential risks and adversities. The Pittsburgh resilience strategy establishes a bold vision for the city, building on the successes in recent decades and a wealth of community assets, while directly confronting the complex challenges that the city continues to face.\nResilience is a holistic approach to urban systems management that demonstrates interrelationships between sectors. The resilience strategy is intended as a guide for city plans and initiatives to achieve maximum community impact by addressing the root causes of systemic challenges. The strategy will help Pittsburgh realize the central purpose of a thriving city in the 21st century: to create conditions in which every resident can flourish in the face of challenges and every community can effectively respond and recover in any circumstance.\nBy fostering a regional atmosphere of collaborative problem solving and resource coordination, the strategy will build on collective efforts and establish a guide for activities that need coordination, acceleration, amplification and initiation. Pittsburgh will thrive in the 21 st century as a city of engaged, empowered and coordinated neighbors.\nCitizens of Pittsburgh,\nResilience is a journey. Cities recognize this statement better than most. Cities exist at the center of the ebb and flow of human progress, and as such have the ability to encourage innovation and great societal benefit. Along our journeys, cities confront the inevitable challenges that disrupt our thoughtful, predetermined courses and have the ability to respond to opportunities that seemingly arise out of nowhere. It is important to recognize that both opportunities and disruptions offer the greatest occasion for administrators and elected officials to capitalize, create benefit and chart new and positive trajectories for their communities.\nFor Pittsburgh, the current chapter of our resilience journey begins with the acknowledgment of our recent past. A reverence to our scars, it is within our history that we find lessons from which we can learn, and set a course that allows us to improve and drive towards a stronger, albeit uncertain future.\nThe City of Pittsburgh and our residents are familiar with the resilience journey. Pittsburgh's history is filled with the peaks of success and the valleys of disappointment. The picture of Pittsburgh is a checkered range marked with impairments such as air and water pollution, labor and racial unrest and economic boom and bust; alongside numerous industrial innovations, advances in science and education and a rich cultural tradition. It is with this recognition of our past that we look forward towards our future. It is this understanding of history that is at the root of our partnership with 100 Resilient Cities, and why we have taken on the challenge of creating Pittsburgh's first resilience strategy.\nToday, Pittsburgh finds itself in a pivotal moment in history. The challenges of globalization, our ever changing environment, and urbanization - once the causes of many of the City's shocks and stresses, are now initiating a shift for the City; from managing population and economic decline to encouraging us to manage growth and prosperity. Amid a time of positive momentum, we recognize that now is the perfect moment in time to chart the course for Pittsburgh's next generation. All Pittsburghers have not benefited from the current momentum, and with this in mind, let me state that a resilient community must be one that provides inclusive, sustainable and welcoming opportunities for all its residents.\nBuilding resilience is a process. Its requires recognition of our challenges, and the ability to heal physical and mental wounds, to create adaptive policies, and to restructure investment decisions. To lead this process, our strategy is built with the belief that with the right tools, the ability to empower our people, and the acknowledgment that the City of Pittsburgh will continu ously improve - we will all come together as neighbors to find solutions to our common problems.\nWe recognize that one of the shortcomings in our past was that we walked separately, along differing paths. Today, we have the opportunity to walk with intent and purpose as a community towards a brighter future. We, the City government, are at the helm of this plan - but we are not at the center. AT the core of this strategy are the residents, the people of the City of Pittsburgh.\nToday, together, we move forward as one Pittsburgh.\nSincerely,\nWilliam Peduto Mayor, City of Pittsburgh\n4 ONE PITTSBLIRGH'S RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nDear Pittsburgh,\nOn behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to congratulate the City of Pittsburgh on the release of ONE PGH: Pittsburgh's Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for the city and for our partnership. ONE PGH lays out an exemplary vision of urban resilience for the city's residents, neighborhoods, and the region. As the city's post-industrial resurgence continues, this Resilience Strategy provides a comprehensive path toward realizing a vision of an inclusive and innovative city where \"if it's not for all, it's not for us.\"\nThe Steel City's success is proof that post-industrial demise is not a permanent condition. After capturing the world's imagination in the late 19th and first half ofthe 20th century- in 1911,the city was producing half ofall American steel - the city devolved into a cautionary tale, with steel mills and related industries shuttering, and the effects of heavy industry taking their toll on the environment. Along with its industrial base, the immense amount of resources that the Fricks, Carnegies, and Mellons invested to create world class educational and cultural institutions also faded. But after losing 40% of its population between 1970 and 2006, Pittsburgh is growing again, this time at the forefront of a rustbelt revival that is anchored in a broad variety of new industries spanning technology, finance, higher education, and advanced manufacturing. But, as this strategy acknowledges, not all in Pittsburgh have felt this rebirth equally.\nThe actions outlined within ONE PGH will strengthen Pittsburgh notjust in theface ofthe sudden shocks that will confront cities throughout the 21st Century, but also the chronic stresses that challenge the city over the longer term, and that exacerbate the effects of those shocks when they do occur. That is the power of resilience solutions: single interventions designed to achieve multiple benefits.\nThe support of City leadership has been critical toward the formation of this Strategy. Mayor Bill Peduto has helped promote resilience as a cornerstone for collaborative action across the city and region, in both the public and private sectors, and has championed the message of an open, resurgent, and globally connected Pittsburgh throughout our network. We thank the Mayor and his team for their commitment. With Strategy Partner RAND, and their valuable expertise, the Resilient Pittsburgh team has led a robust, community-driven process that reached far and wide, reflecting the full spectrum of Pittsburgh's voices and concerns.\nAs our partnership moves into implementation, it does so with a major advantage - the city's groundbreaking planning initiative, p4 Pittsburgh. Launched in 2015, p4 provides a framework for unified action across the city to achieve a just and sustainable future. Its ethos of collaboration and communal reach will deepen the impact ofthe Strategy, and contribute to the shared goal of a \"world class city that benefits all.\"\nPittsburgh has already shown its ability to recover and adapt to the new challenges ofthe 21 st Century and we are excited for the continued course of resilience this Strategy charts.\nCongratulations again on this enormous achievement, and we look forward to our continued partnership in the journey ahead.\nMichael Berkowitz President, 100 Resilient Cities\n6 ONE PITTSBLIRGH'S RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nCITY CONTEXT\nThe City of Pittsburgh celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2016 as a city on the rise. The grit and ingenuity of generations of Pittsburghers has helped the city rebound after fires, floods, and the collapse of the steel industry in the mid-20th century. After losing 40 percent of its population between 1970 and 2006, Pittsburgh is growing again. The number of millennials and recent college graduates in the city, for example, went up by more than eight percent over the past decade. Today, Pittsburgh faces lower natural disaster risk and is less exposed to another economic shock than many other cities due to its location, natural resources, and diversified economy. Investments in higher education, workforce retraining, startups and small businesses, and the redevelopment and remediation of a thousand acres of former industrial sites have drawn attention to Pittsburgh as one of America's most livable cities.\nWHY A RESILIENCE STRATEGY FOR PITTSBURGH?\nDespite its well-publicized recent successes, the \"Steel City\" must still overcome the stresses associated with its industrial legacy and crumbling infrastructure, while responding to ongoing pressures stemming from urbanization, globalization, and climate change. Persistent socioeconomic inequities, coupled with a history of fragmented governance, planning and service delivery, continue to undercut resident quality of life and strain city resources.\nPublic, private, and non-profit organizations have made significant investments in building a more livable Pittsburgh, cleaning up the city's industrial legacy, and creating new economic and residential opportunities. A number of strategic initiatives have been initiated in recent years to address resilience-related goals, including p4, the Roadmap for Inclusive Innovation, Welcoming Pittsburgh, a Climate Action Plan, My Brother's Keeper, a Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment, and the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC). These collective efforts are helping to transform the city's narrative from a story of loss and decline to one of resilience and opportunity, but have not yet been aligned or coordinated to ensure successful implementation or improved and sustainable outcomes for residents'wellbeing. This strategy\nwill strengthen collaborations and support the integration of the practice of urban resilience among the people and the institutions of the city. It will afford long-term benefits by ensuring:\n\u2022\tImproved coordination among government and non-government organizations\n\u2022\tBetter budgeting and capital coordination city-wide\n\u2022\tAdoption of resilience practices in government, institutions, organizations, neighborhoods, etc.\n\u2022\tIncreased resident engagement and empowerment\nThe present time represents an important crossroads for the city. Pittsburgh seeks to capitalize on its recovery with sustainable growth, but needs to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. The way forward demands thoughtful planning, close coordination, and integration between and among government and nongovernmental partners to ensure that the city grows equitably and sustainably. The city also must recognize the needs and value of its long-term residents while welcoming and supporting newcomers.\nCapitalizing on Pittsburgh's assets\u2014its universities; wealth of parks, rivers, and streams; robust philanthropic sector; highly collaborative spirit; new economic drivers; visionary and capable non-profits; and resident enthusiasm and activity\u2014Resilient Pittsburgh and its partners developed a comprehensive strategy to address these opportunities and challenges. Pittsburgh applied and was selected to become one of 100 Resilient Cities- Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) in December 2014. 100RC helps cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC defines resilience as the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nHOW THE STRATEGY WAS DEVELOPED\nThe 100RC City Resilience Strategy process includes three phases. Phase 1 involved stakeholder engagement and data collection activities to understand the current state of the city's resilience, resulting in a Preliminary Resilience Assessment. Phase 2 entailed in-depth research on themes\n10 ONE PITTSBLIRGH'S RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nidentified in Phase 1, additional stakeholder engagement; brainstorming of the goals, objectives, and actions that comprise the resilience framework; and prioritization and synthesis work, culminating in this resilience strategy. Phase 3, implementation, will follow release of the strategy. This process was led by the Resilient Pittsburgh team, comprised of the city's Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) Grant Ervin and the City Resilience team in the Division of Sustainability and Resilience, the RAND Corporation as a strategy partner, and 100RC as the funder and collaborator. It has also involved the contributions of over 600 Pittsburghers since June 2015.\nThis document describes Pittsburgh's resilience strategy. The strategy is intended to acknowledge and address the city's recent challenges and trends pro-actively, applying lessons from the past and from other partnering cities to forge a stronger future for the city and region. Because the city of Pittsburgh is the beneficiary of funding from 100RC, the strategy will often refer to \"Pittsburgh\" or \"the city\" in a leadership capacity. However, the vision of a resilient Pittsburgh extends beyond the city borders, and recommendations in this strategy aim to help the entire Pittsburgh metropolitan region move toward a model of greater collaboration in order to support planning and convey benefits to the region more broadly.\nabout affordability and gentrification have also emerged as the city redevelops, and an aging population and workforce continue to threaten the economic stability of the region. Simultaneously, fragmentation of effort among non-profits and local governments in the region hinders efforts to address these challenges. Moreover, acute shocks, some predicted to become more likely as a result of climate change, pose threats to the city. Potential future shocks include extreme weather, flooding, landslides, and extreme temperatures, among other concerns identified during strategy development.\nPITTSBURGH'S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES\nThe threats to Pittsburgh's resilience form a constellation of risks, including both chronic stresses\u2014long-term, slow burning issues that overwhelm the capacity of city resources and erode resident wellbeing\u2014and potential acuteshocks\u2014 sudden, large-scale disasters that disrupt city services and threaten residents from extreme weather.\nWhile the city's inland geography protects its residents from many of the natural hazards that are expected to occur more frequently in coastal regions, the city's endemic stresses disproportionately affect some of its most vulnerable residents and represent its core resilience challenges. Specifically, Pittsburgh faces significant challenges with social, racial, and economic inequities that have persisted for decades, which have led to unequal access to housing, transportation, employment, and services. Other key stresses affecting vulnerable Pittsburghers include aging infrastructure and poor air and water quality. Concerns\nPITTSBURGH'S RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK\nThe Pittsburgh resilience strategy consists of a holistic set of goals, objectives, and actions that tackle some of the region's major resilience challenges and help the city build the capacity to successfully confront future threats. The goals of Pittsburgh resilience framework purposefully align with the four\"p\"s of the p4 framework, already adopted by partners across the city to inspire innovative, sustainable, and inclusive action. The resilience framework then builds upon p4 to create a holistic, community-centered approach and to describe the specific ways in which different sectors will work collectively to make Pittsburgh a resilient city in terms of its People, Place, Planet, and Performance.\nPEOPLE\nPittsburgh will empower all residents to contribute to thriving and supportive communities by ensuring that basic needs are met. We will be an inclusive city of innovation that celebrates our diversity, and all residents will have equal access to resources and opportunity\nPLACE\nPittsburgh will use land to benefit all residents; to increase social cohesion, connectivity, public and ecological health; and to protect against current and future risks. We will design, scale, and maintain our infrastructure for current and future needs, providing benefits and services to our neighborhoods during times of calm and crisis\nPLANET\nPittsburgh will achieve long-term environmental health through wise stewardship, improved use of our resources, and a reduced carbon footprint\nPERFORMANCE\nPittsburgh will work closely with neighbors and partners for improved planning and decision-making\nEach of these four goals is supported by a series of sector-specific objective. While each objective typically focuses on a specific topic area within each goal, the objectives are also designed to work across stresses and shocks to produce a \"resilience dividend\" - that is, multiple benefits for resilience from a single activity.\nThis strategy identifies both existing and new actions related to resilience, connects these actions to relevant resilience goals and objectives, and identifies next steps to ensure that these actions can be implemented successfully to yield improved outcomes for residents. Detail on Pittsburgh's resilience actions can be found in Appendix A.\n12\nSTRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION\nThe Pittsburgh resilience strategy requires a comprehensive implementation plan to support uptake, integration, and long-term sustainability. The Division of Sustainability and Resilience, as a part of the Department of City Planning in collaboration with the Mayor's Office, will serve as the lead office for strategy implementation and will support a series of implementation steps through the next year to facilitate the effective rollout and adoption of the strategy across sectors and stakeholders. The immediate next steps for strategy implementation in year one include:\n1.\tConvene action leadership groups\n2.\tEstablish a governance and institutionalization framework\n3.\tEstablish a measurement framework\n4.\tIntegrate resilience-building into civic engagement and public events.\nThe new and existing actions featured in this strategy are the activities to be implemented in order for Pittsburgh to achieve its resilience goals and objectives. Addressing the goals of Pittsburgh's resilience strategy requires not only the initiation of some new actions, but also better coordination, amplification, and acceleration of promising existing government and nongovernmental activities and initiatives to create a resilient and livable city of innovation for all. Figure 2 shows an example of how existing and new activities fall along a taxonomy of implementation.\nFigure 2. Taxonomy for implementing resilience actions with select examples\nAdditional efforts are needed to support implementation over the long term. These include coordination among government and nongovernmental sectors, resource allocation and a cohesive investment framework, community awareness and ongoing education, and targeted partner building. Ongoing measurement and regular analysis and use of the data collected will also be central to implementation.\nInitiate\nCoordinate Amplify Accelerate\nDevelop and implement new initiatives. Next steps entail identifying lead organizations and assembling working groups to begin action plans.\nAlign ongoing actions with multiple owners and actors to a common set of goals. Next steps; involve determining governance processes and roles and responsibilities for diverse partners.\nExpand scope, reach, and\/or impact of pilot or recently initiated actions. Next steps entail identifying the ways in which actions ought to be expanded, additional resources required, and plans or proposals for new funding resources.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe City of Pittsburgh celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2016. The grit and ingenuity of generations of Pittsburghers has helped the city rebound afterfires,floods,and the collapse of the steel industry in the mid-20th century. After losing 40 percent of its population between 1970 and 2006, Pittsburgh is growing again. Today, Pittsburgh faces lower natural disaster risk and is less exposed to another economic shock than many other cities due to its location, natural resources, and diversified economy. Investments in higher education, workforce retraining, startups and small businesses, and the redevelopment and remediation of a thousand acres of former industrial sites have drawn attention to Pittsburgh as one of America's most livable cities. The city is home to 378 Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) certified projects and two \"living buildings.\"4 Pittsburgh was named the number one food city in America by Zagat in 2015, and 2,800 new hotel rooms have been added in the city since 2011.5\nHowever, the \"Steel City\" must still overcome the stresses associated with its industrial legacy and crumbling infrastructure while responding to ongoing pressures stemming from the global mega-trends of urbanization, globalization, and climate change. Persistent socioeconomic inequities, coupled with a history of fragmented governance, planning and service delivery, continue to undercut resident quality of life and strain city resources.\nTo build upon the city's strengths and to improve its resilience, Pittsburgh applied and was selected to become one of 100 Resilient Cities- Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) in December 2014. 100RC helps cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC defines resilience as the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.\nBecoming part of 100RC has provided Pittsburgh with funding for a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) to lead resilience efforts and a team to support him (Resilient Pittsburgh); resources for developing this resilience strategy;\nmembership in a global partnership network of peer cities to share lessons learned; and access to a city solutions network, which provides member cities with access to a curated suite of resilience-building tools and services. The 100RC network also allows the city to share Pittsburgh's story and learn from the community of cities around the world. The Resilient Pittsburgh team sees this as an important opportunity to harness community energy and realize the potential of Pittsburgh's residents and institutions to create positive and lasting long-term change.\nPURPOSE OF THE STRATEGY\nPittsburgh has already demonstrated marked resilience in recent decades after recovering from the steel industry's collapse. But this story remains unfinished: the city's livability and affordability are not broadly shared among residents, and ongoing stresses and acute shocks continue to strain city resources. In 2016, for example, the city suffered a series of new shocks. In August, flash flooding put Washington Boulevard, a main thoroughfare in the city's East End where flooding became fatal in 2014, underwater again. Routine maintenance caused a fire which closed the Liberty Bridge, a critical transportation link between the City of Pittsburgh and the South Hills suburbs, for multiple weeks in September. Consumer alerts from PWSA in the summer of 2016 exposed elevated lead levels in Pittsburgh's drinking water. These events put a spotlight on the continued challenges the city faces.\nThe resilience strategy serves as a blueprint to better prepare the city for these kinds of inevitable challenges. It is intended to help Pittsburghers work together to address the deeply rooted structural, social, economic, and environmental stresses that threaten the progress of the city and its residents. This strategy will strengthen collaborations and support the integration of the practice of urban resilience among the people and the institutions of the city. It will afford long-term benefits by ensuring:\n\u2022\tImproved coordination among government and non-government organizations\n\u2022\tBetter budgeting and capital coordination city-wide\n\u2022\tAdoption of resilience practices in government, institutions, organizations, neighborhoods, etc.\n\u2022\tIncreased resident engagement and empowerment\nThe resilience strategy describes a high-level framework to understand resilience in Pittsburgh, relates existing and new programs and investments to this framework, and provides a pathway to evaluating the long-term resilience value of government and nongovernmental actions. It is also intended to serve as an \"investment prospectus\" for the city by showing where gaps exist and where new investment could yield the greatest benefits and co-benefits for all city residents. Building on the Mayor's vision, the Resilient Pittsburgh team asserts that Pittsburgh will be a resilient city when the entire community shares in the same opportunities for prosperity and all residents are equally well cared for and prepared to face potential risks.\nPITTSBURGH'S CITY CONTEXT\nPittsburgh is a mid-sized American city with a current population of just over 300,0006 and is the principal city of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is home to over 1.2 million residents.7 The broader ten-county metropolitan region includes 2.57 million residents, making it the 22nd largest metropolitan area in the United States.7-8\nDEEP CONNECTION TO NEIGHBORHOOD & PLACE\nPittsburgh's 90 unique neighborhoods are places that people care about. Pittsburghers have a strong sense of identity within the neighborhoods where they live now or where they grew up. This connection is not limited to a physical place, but includes a shared emotional connection with the people and experiences created in that neighborhood. Within these neighborhoods, a community ethos is born, a sense of pride and a willingness to collaborate that is shared from generation to generation.\nPittsburgh's geography is defined by hills, waterways, and bridges (Figure 4). The city is famously located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers (and their tributaries), which converge just outside of downtown to form the Ohio River. Over 2,000 miles of streams and 90 miles of rivers flow through Allegheny County (Figure 5).15 Transportation routes generally follow the paths of rivers and streams, but the city is also home to some of the steepest streets and roads in the country, which connect different communities. These features contribute to a unique and beautiful cityscape but also divide the city into isolated\ngeographic\"pockets.\"\nWestern Pennsylvania includes a wealth of natural infrastructure, including forests, waterways, and other habitats sustained by Pittsburgh's relatively wet climate. The city and Allegheny County manage over 15,000 acres of parks or urban forest, providing a green landscape and recreational opportunities for residents and visitors. Active conservation by city and county park organizations has expanded and improved these amenities in recent years. The city and local nonprofits support urban agriculture and local food systems, including a number of community gardens and strategic uses of vacant land.\nFigure 4. Topographic map of Pittsburgh\n20\n\n\nThe city's and the region's populations have both skewed older in recent decades. The proportion of elderly residents (age 65 and older) in Allegheny County was 16.7 percent in 2010, compared with 13 percent for the nation as a whole.12 This proportion is projected to grow to 21 percent by 2040, mirroring national demographic trends.12 However, Pittsburgh is also experiencing a resurgence of young people moving to the city or remaining after graduating from one of its colleges and universities: In the past decade, there has been a 29-percent increase in young graduates choosing to remain in the city.13\nPittsburgh's narrative has been characterized by dramatic shifts in population size, industry viability, and economic development. Known as the \"Gateway to the West\" in its early days as\na frontier village,\nPittsburgh's location\nat the convergence\nof the Allegheny,\nMonongahela and\nOhio Rivers provided\nideal access for\nshipping materials and\nthe region's abundant\nnatural resources\nby river and rail. The\ncity's population and\nindustrial power rose in the late 19th and early 20th century during the Industrial Era.\nThe steel and industrial boom produced investments in the city's physical infrastructure and educational and cultural institutions, led by industrialists and financiers such as Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, and Henry Clay Frick who built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. While heavy industry, coal mining, and steel production provided jobs, prominence, and money to the region, they also took a toll on city residents and the natural environment, leading to severe air and water pollution, acid mine drainage, and polluted soils. By the 1940s, Pittsburgh was critical in producing steel, ammunition and battleships for the war effort.\nPittsburgh's postWWII peak was followed by major economic changes, including the collapse of the domestic steel industry in the 1970s and 80s, the recession of 1982-83, and\nsuburban flight, which all led to the out-migration of much of the population. By 2000, the city's population had halved along with its tax base, while the amount of infrastructure requiring maintenance remained the same.\nAs the population shrank, the City struggled to maintain quality of life for its residents. In the 1990s, the City and County formed the Regional Asset District, a 1% county-wide sales tax to fund cultural institutions, recreational facilities and libraries. City government-owned assets such as the National Aviary, Phipps Conservatory and the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium then became nonprofit organizations that received RAD funding 18. During this time, Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority was formed for bonding capacity. In 2003, the City laid off 446 full and part time employees, and in 2004 petitioned the Commonwealth to be designated as distressed according to the criteria of Act 47, and subject to Commonwealth oversight. Pittsburgh's credit rating was\tgiven junk bond\nstatus.19\nThe\tdecentralization of\nassets and lack of capacity for service delivery at the city government led to the rise of philanthropy and the nonprofit sector to fill the voids and maintain quality of life for Pittsburghers. Today, as the City government rebounds, fragmentation between organizations and government challenges the efficiency of providing services to city residents, while years of deferred maintenance of the city's oversized infrastructure is emerging from a major stress into\na cascade of shocks.\nAt the same time, however, rising housing prices in Pittsburgh's traditionally mixed-income neighborhoods, concerns that the new tech-based economic growth may not provide broad-based opportunities, and a recognition that Pittsburgh's close neighbors (its inner-ring suburbs) have largely not rebounded from the collapse of the steel industry have raised questions about who is benefiting from Pittsburgh's transformation. Recent analyses ranked Pittsburgh in the bottom quarter of the top 100 regions nationwide in terms of progress on racial economic inclusion, as defined by racial gaps in wages, poverty, and employment.21\nUpgrades and maintenance of the city's infrastructure and some of its institutions have also not been keeping pace with the rapidly changing environment.22 Moreover, local venture capital investment will not fully meet the needs of growth-stage companies started in the city, and many ofthe city's most successful knowledge-based companies have sought support from outside ofthe city to grow their businesses.23\nThe present time represents an important crossroads for the city. Pittsburgh seeks to capitalize on its recovery with sustainable growth, but needs to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. The way forward demands thoughtful planning, close coordination, and integration between and among government and nongovernmental partners to ensure that the city grows equitably and sustainably. The city also must recognize the needs and value of its long-term residents while welcoming and supporting newcomers. A number of strategic initiatives have been initiated in recent years to address resilience-related goals (Figure 8). These include, for example, changes to city operations, p4, the Roadmap for Inclusive Innovation, Welcoming Pittsburgh, a Climate Action Plan, My Brother's Keeper, the City's Comprehensive Plan, a Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment, and the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC). These collective efforts are helping to transform the city's narrative from a story of loss and decline to one of resilience and opportunity but have not yet been aligned or coordinated to ensure successful implementation or improved and sustainable outcomes for residents' wellbeing.\nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nThe Resilient Pittsburgh team is comprised of the city's CRO Grant Ervin, the City Resilience team in the Division of Sustainability and Resilience, RAND Corporation as the strategy partner, and 100RC. The team developed this strategy by researching the challenges facing Pittsburgh, gathering input from a wide range of stakeholders, convening residents for Deliberative Community Forums using the Deliberative Democracy process (see pg. 97 for more information), and connecting with other members of the 10ORC network. From June 2015 through January 2017, more than 600 Pittsburghers were engaged to support the strategy development.\nPHASE I\nJune 2015\nInitial workshop with focus groups concentrating on: Academic, Civic, Business, Philanthropy, Neighborhoods & Regional\nNovember 2015\nDeliberative Community Forums with 150 participants\nOctober 2015\nCity\/Stakeholders Workshop\nJanuary 2016\nSteering Committee\nThe Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA)\nPhase 1 strategy development process, including more detail on Pittsburgh\u2019s shocks, stresses, and assets.\nPHASE II\nMay 2016\nDiscovery Area Workshops:\nJuly - October 2016 In-depth research activities\nResilience Strategy Pittsburgh\u2019s vision for the future; A resilient Pittsburgh\nJuly-August 2016\nSystems Performance Workshops\nNovember 2016\nSteering Committee Review\nPITTSBURGH'S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES:\nSTRESSES & SHOCKS\nThe threats to Pittsburgh's resilience form a constellation of risks, including chronic stresses related to water management, air quality, equal opportunity, and aging infrastructure and potential acute shocks from extreme weather due to climate change, another economic collapse, or infrastructure failure (Figure 12).

As of 2010, Pittsburgh was considered the 17th most residentially segregated city of the 50 U.S. metropolitan regions with the largest populations of black residents,9 a remnant of redlining policies from the mid-20th century, which limited the ability of Pittsburghers of color to get mortgages in certain neighborhoods (Figure 14). While Pittsburgh today is gaining recognition for its quality of life and livability, not all of the city's neighborhoods are sharing in the same prosperity. Some communities are negatively impacted by the city's development, as housing prices rise and employment growth among historically disadvantaged populations remains relatively stagnant. Historical and structural racial discrimination is evident in Pittsburgh's neighborhood segregation and economic inequities continue to play a role in influencing the quality of life of many of Pittsburgh's residents of color (Figure 15).\nFigure 15. Inequity in Pittsburgh: a snapshot\nEmployment and poverty:\n*\tUnemployment rates show racial patterns, with black men having an unemployment rate of 12.2% compared to 5.1% for white men.26\n\u2022\t55% of black girls in Pittsburgh live in poverty.28\nEducation:\n\u2022\tIn 2014, only 37% of black PPS 3rd to 8th graders were reading-proficient compared to 45% of black students of the same age statewide, 71% of white PPS students, and 77% of white students statewide.29\n\u2022\tBlack girls are 3X more likely to be suspended from school than white girls.28\nHealth:\n\u2022\tBlack Pittsburghers face higher rates of exposure to air toxins, smoking rates, hospitalization due to asthma, and infant mortality rates than do white Pittsburghers.30\n\u2022\tPredominantly black neighborhoods lacking access to full-service grocery stores, farmers' markets, or other sources of healthy food options include Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, and Beechview.31\nAffordable housing\n\u2022\tBetween 2000 and 2014, housing prices in Allegheny County increased 59%\n\u2022\tBetween 2000 and 2014 housing prices in Lawrenceville increased 369\u00b0\/\nSafety and justice:\n\u2022\tHomicide data from 2010 to 201533 showed 94 homicides in five majority-blackareas of the city compared to J homicides in the majority-white neighborhoods just across the street (Penn Avenue, running through Pittsburgh's East End).\n\u2022\tBlack Pittsburghers were more than 3x as likely as residents of other races to report being a victim of a crime.34\n\u2022\tIn 2014, blacks constituted 56% of all arrests in Pittsburgh, although they make up only 26.1% of the population.7-35\nTransportation:\n\u2022\tAbout 1\/4 of Pittsburgh residents do not own a car.36\n\u2022\tThe average Pittsburgher spends 42% of his or her annual income on housing and transportation,36 which is at the upper limit of what the U.S. Department ofTransportation has deemed to be\"affordable\"for housing and transportation.37\nFragmentation across governments and non-profits Fragmentation challenges local governance and the ability to address endemic stresses facing Pittsburghers. The City of Pittsburgh alone includes 90 neighborhoods, while Allegheny County has 130 municipalities, and the ten-county metropolitan region includes over 900 government units. Each municipality has independent responsibility for managing infrastructure and administering many local services, making it far more difficult for the city to plan and collaborate with the diverse and plentiful local political entities. Concurrently, the City of Pittsburgh is home to over 3,100 non-profit organizations, many with overlapping missions,and often competing forthe same resources. Finally, ongoing planning efforts related to climate action, inclusive economic development, stormwater management and other priorities abound in the city, demanding intentional integration in order to capitalize on the opportunity for co-benefits.\nIndustrial legacy\nLike many other Midwestern cities, Pittsburgh's population and built infrastructure are both aging. Economic hardship in the late 20th century led to deferred maintenance of roads, bridges, and water and sewer management systems. As jobs left the city, Pittsburgh's population started to shrink and baby boomers that remained began to age as the city struggled to retain young people for its workforce. Pittsburgh's industrial past also led to a slew of air, water, and soil quality issues that plague the city to this day.\nAging population and workforce\nThe proportion of elderly residents (age 65 and older) in Allegheny County was 16.7 percent in 2010, compared with 13 percent for the nation as a whole. This proportion is projected to grow to 21 percent by 2040, mirroring national demographic trends.12 An aging population poses challenges in terms of city and regional services, workforce maintenance and growth, and provision of healthcare and public health services.\nThe proportion of baby boomers nearing retirement is especially large in Pittsburgh, where 1.2 million workers will need to be hired or up-skilled over the next 10 years. Some of Pittsburgh's key industries will likely be hit by retirements, including energy, manufacturing, and utilities service delivery; these changes open opportunities for new\njobs as traditional industries evolve or disappear. And while Pittsburgh has historically struggled to keep graduates of its universities in the area, over the last decade, there has been a 29-percent increase in young graduates choosing to remain in the city.13\nAging infrastructure\nMuch of Pittsburgh's infrastructure, including transportation networks, water and sewer management systems, and housing stock, was constructed during the population boom of the early-mid 20th century (Figure 17). Select neighborhoods in the city have benefited from redevelopment over the past few decades, but deferred repairs and upgrades in many communities have left a capital burden that currently strains city and county resources. For example, Allegheny County's sanitary sewer system, which services the city and 82 neighboring communities, is aging, poorly maintained, and inadequately sized to capture and treat stormwater during the region's frequent wet weather events. Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority's (PWSA) drinking water system is similarly strained, and loses at least one quarter of water treated at its single treatment plant to pipe leaks or bursts.38 And concerns are mounting about aging and corroding pipes releasing lead into drinking water.\nMoreover, modernization of Pittsburgh's energy and communications systems is required to help the city to achieve its goals of innovation and sustainability. The city relies on a large-scale, interconnected electricity distribution system. Temporary power outages are common in the city and are likely to increase as the energy grid is strained during extreme weather events. Aging infrastructure not only contributes to degradation in these networks but can also render the whole system vulnerable to widespread and cascading infrastructure failure.\nFigure 17. Pittsburgh's aging infrastructure\nRoads, bridges, locks, and dams:\n\u2022\t5,147.4 square miles of roadway in the city39\n= average date of last construction or repair of bridge in the city40\nof the operational bridges in Pittsburgh were considered structurally deficient, and 22 of those 51 deemed \"structurally deficient\" were principal arterial connections.40\n\u2022\tPittsburgh and the surrounding river system contain 23 locks and dams used to regulate water flow, transportation, and water supply to the city.39\nStorm and wastewater management:\n\u2022\t9 billion gallons of combined stormwater and wastewater overflows yearly41\n\u2022\tALCOSAN (the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, which operates the only sewer treatment facility for Pittsburgh and 82 neighboring municipalities) is bound by an EPA consent decree to reduce combined sewer overflows by at least 85%\nNatural gas conveyance:\n\u2022\tA natural gas leak in the city's conveyance system occurs\nevery\t43\nHousing and building stock:\n\u2022\tMost houses in Pittsburgh are over 60 years old43\n\u2022\tRenter-occupied properties approaching a median age\n\u00b0f65 years 4\nElectricity grid:\n* During the polarvortexof 2014, a regional transmission operator lost 22% of its capacity.44\nDue to the age and condition of much of the City of Pittsburgh's infrastructure and with the potential strain placed on infrastructure due to extreme weather, the possibility of infrastructure failure is a growing concern. Because of the city's dynamic topography of hills, valleys, and waterways, for instance, any failure to a key road, tunnel, or bridge could immobilize residents, potentially isolating thousands of individuals until access is restored.\nEnvironmental degradation: air, water, and soil Pittsburgh's industrial past and aging infrastructure have led to air, water, and soil contamination. Pittsburgh still ranks among the top U.S. cities for worst air quality, and in wet weather, the combined sewer system overflows and spills raw sewage into the city's rivers. Much of the current air, water, and soil degradation stems from Pittsburgh's industrial legacy, when the sky was dark with smoke at noon45 In 2012, EPA categorized the region as an air quality non-attainment area, and Pittsburgh's air quality was 14th worst (24-hour PM2.5) in the country as of 201646 This represents an improvement over recent years, though health and environmental impacts of poor air quality persist. New industries moving into the city and the surrounding area, including an ethane cracker plant and hydraulic fracturing operations, will have additional environmental impacts.\nInequity based on class\nWhile racial inequity is especially pronounced in Pittsburgh, the city looks similar to many other Northeast or Midwestern cities in terms of inequities based on income. Lower-income Pittsburghers of any race or ethnicity tend to have less access to services, worse educational outcomes, and poorer health than their middle- and high-income counterparts. Prolonged disinvestment in Pittsburgh's inner-ring suburbs\u2014 particularly in the Monongahela Valley, where vacancy and crime are on the rise\u2014could have spillover effects regionwide.47\nOpioid crisis\nSubstance use disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent in Western Pennsylvania. Opioids are a class of drug often prescribed for pain, but recreational use of such drugs is often linked to substance use disorders, which are a contributing factor in its rising number of opioid overdose deaths. In 2014 and 2015, Pennsylvania\u2014in particular, Allegheny, Westmoreland, and Washington counties within Western Pennsylvania\u2014experienced some of the highest\noverdose deaths per capita of any region of the country.48 Many experts now characterize the opioid problem in Western Pennsylvania and across the United States as a public health emergency, partially predicated on the breakdown of social services, sense of isolation, and dislocation from the new economy observed broadly in communities across the region.\nGender-based inequity\nWomen in Pittsburgh struggle with pay inequity.49 Pittsburgh also ranks 96th out of 100 metro areas in promoting women-owned businesses, and the city lags behind many other metro areas in growth of women-owned businesses. There has also recently been increased awareness of the ways in which racism and sexism impede the wellbeing, academic success, and positive development of Black girls and women in Pittsburgh, such as through higher poverty, school discipline, and exposure to violence.28\nInvasive species\nPittsburgh's urban forest is one of its greatest assets: almost 40,000 trees were inventoried in the city\u2014amounting 41 percent ofthe city having tree cover\u2014which has been found to provide substantial ecosystem services to the city each year.50 52 However, the region's tree canopy is susceptible to pests, invasive species, and other risk factors. An alarming 67 percent of the city's tree canopy is at risk of destruction by the Asian longhorned beetle. The emerald ash borer was first identified in Pittsburgh in 2007 and attacks all ash trees, which make up nine percent ofthe city's tree canopy. Other threats include fungus, disease, and invasive plant species. A decrease in tree canopy would not only reduce air and water quality and stormwater benefits, but destabilize hillsides as well.51\nPOTENTIAL SHOCKS IN AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE\nWhile the stresses Pittsburgh experiences erode resident wellbeing on a day-to-day basis, the potential for future catastrophic events looms on the horizon. While Pittsburgh's geography protects it from a number of climate change impacts, the likelihood of severe weather and related shocks is expected to increase in the future.\nClimate change and extreme weather\nPittsburgh confronts a variety of challenges from extreme\nweather, and most emerging evidence suggests that the risks will grow with climate change:\n\u2022 Precipitation and flooding: Much of the city is adjacent to rivers and streams and their floodplains, and local weather patterns can produce a range of extreme precipitation events. Lack of capacity in the city's stormwater management system, combined with Pittsburgh's topography and changing weather patterns, have led to an increase in flash flooding in recent years. Such events have caused major disasters in the city's history, but climate change could make extreme weather events in Pittsburgh either more frequent, more intense, or both.\n\u2022\tWinter storms: Large winter storms are relatively common in Pennsylvania and are expected to happen more frequently. Major winter storms occur an average of five times per year in Pennsylvania, and since 2003, Pittsburgh has experienced three major snowstorms which led to emergency declarations.39 In the coming decades, the Northeastern United States is projected to experience a greater number of major winter storms, with an average precipitation increase of 5 to 20 percent.\n\u2022\tExtreme temperatures: Extreme hot and cold temperatures are expected to have a greater impact on the city in the future. Long and extended cold spells are common during winters in Pittsburgh. On the other hand, the climate is warming, and temperature fluctuations are increasing. Pittsburgh also experiences an \"urban heat island effect,\" in which cities with more thermal mass tend to be 1 to 3 degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas.53 Pittsburgh's aging population and housing infrastructure, including outdated heating\nand cooling systems, place residents at increased risk of negative health effects stemming from extreme temperatures.\n\u2022 Landslides and subsidence incidents regularly affect parts of the city and may only get worse. The city and region have a long history of coal extraction and related erosion, putting many areas at risk for subsidence and sink holes in addition to the landslide risk to Pittsburgh's fragile hillsides. These risks are exacerbated by extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall. In fact, 900 structures within the city limits are considered to be in areas\"very hazardous to landslides\", and all of Allegheny County is classified as a \"high incidence\" area for landslides.39-54 In recent years, landslides have occurred in the neighborhoods of Oakland, Greenfield, and Perry North. In 2014, wet weather caused a landslide on Mount Washington which covered 100 yards of rail lines, halting train traffic for 2 days.\nHazardous materials incident\nHazardous materials, including oil and natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, are transported directly through the City of Pittsburgh by road, rail, and barge multiple times per day, increasing the risk of an accident occurring within the city. Pittsburgh is a hub for a series of major transportation routes, including 1-376,1-279, Route 28, Route 65, several rail lines, and the three rivers,39 and an estimated 1.5 million people in Pennsylvania live in an area that could be affected by a train derailment resulting in a fire.55\nEconomic collapse\nWhile Pittsburgh's economy is increasingly reliant on the healthcare, education, and technology sectors, these sectors are also experiencing rapid changes. Pittsburgh's \"eds and meds\" economy is in the spotlight as health care reform continues to be evaluated and increasing attention is paid to the cost of higher education. The volatility within these two drivers of Pittsburgh's economy creates concern about the risk of a significant economic collapse, not unlike that of the steel industry in the mid-20th century. Moreover, general economic trends of globalization, automation, and reliance on technology may pose additional challenges for Pittsburgh's key industries. However, these trends, if capitalized upon strategically, also have the potential to provide substantial economic opportunities given Pittsburgh's growing technology startup sector. Finally, the significant proportion of Pittsburgh residents employed by non-profits would also be negatively impacted by changes in government contracts, public or private grant making, or charitable giving precipitated by, or independent of, other economic shifts. Increased venture capital funding for new startups and support for owner-occupied small businesses in the city's neighborhoods would help to stave off negative impacts of major shifts in the city's key industries.\n34 ONE PITTSBLIRGH'S RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nPITTSBURGH'S RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK\nresources, and a reduced carbon footprint\nThe analysis of Pittsburgh's shocks and stresses, coupled with extensive feedback from Resilient Pittsburgh stakeholders and participants (see appendix_for methodology), informed the resilience goals and objectives that comprise Pittsburgh's resilience framework. This framework describes not only what a future resilient Pittsburgh will look like but also notes how specific sectors will playa role in addressing the chronic stresses facing the city and preparing for potential shocks.\nPittsburgh's resilience goals are aligned with the p4 framework, which has been adopted bytheCity of Pittsburgh and partners city-wide to inspire urban development that is \"innovative, inclusive, and sustainable.\" The resilience frameworkadds specificity to p4, detailing specific objectives to be undertaken in order to meet Pittsburgh's resilience goals (Figure 18). The framework is holistic and community-centered, and acknowledges the integrated cross-sector activity that must also occur to achieve resilience. Resilience actions detail ongoing activities that provide resilience value because they address stresses and shocks as well as new actions that are needed to build a more resilient Pittsburgh.\nPERFORMANCE\nPittsburgh will work closely with neighbors and partners for improved planning and decision-making\nFigure 18 shows the p4 framework with Pittsburgh's resilience objectives.

Resilient Pittsburgh has also sought to better understand the implementation status of city and regional actions that help realize resilience objectives. Addressing the goals of Pittsburgh's resilience strategy requires not only the initiation of some new actions but also better coordination, amplification, and acceleration of ongoing governmental and nongovernmental activities and initiatives.\n\u2022\tInitiate: Develop and implement new initiatives. Next steps entail identifying lead organizations and assembling working groups to begin action plans.\n\u2022\tCoordinate: Align ongoing actions with multiple owners and actors to a common set of goals.

Data is increasingly being shared to support action in a range of sectors, including health, transportation, and public safety, both within the City of Pittsburgh, for example, through the use of Accela to coordinate efforts across city departments (see breakout box on pg. 82), and by public sector agencies, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations. Data sharing provides a foundation on which to address shared issues and reduce the stovepiping that often inhibits collaboration, while empowering residents with information about their community.\nIMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY\nThe strategy offers a single, unifying way to strengthen the resilience and wellbeing of all Pittsburgh residents. For the promise of the strategy to be realized, the city plans to support a series of implementation steps through the next year to ensure coordinated and effective rollout and adoption by a range of sectors and stakeholders.\nIn the near term, the city will integrate resilience strategy into core government activities, as evidenced by the institutionalization of the Resilient Pittsburgh team to the Division of Sustainability and Resilience within the Department of City Planning, the creation of action leadership teams on themes from the strategy (e.g., economic development and workforce, cohesive monitoring and evaluation), and clear resource allocations to support priority strategy objectives. These near-term steps will ensure that the strategy produces clear outcomes but also catalyzes continued dialogue and immediate action. Further, in order to facilitate implementation, the city will need to effectively organize current city activities to realize their respective benefits for resilience. Finally, in the long term, organizational alignment and smart resource allocation will be important for strategy maintenance and sustainability.\nNEAR-TERM IMPLEMENTATION STEPS\nThe release of the resilience strategy will take on a multifaceted approach, both to ensure the work is representative of diverse stakeholders and to realize maximum impact. The Resilient Pittsburgh website will outline highlights from the strategy document, serve as the platform for measuring progress over time, and will host a repository of ongoing events and initiatives related to the strategy. A video will provide additional context for the vision of Resilient Pittsburgh and inspire Pittsburghers to create positive change in their neighborhoods and households. Finally, an investment prospectus will draw from the actions featured in the strategy to address resilience challenges, and motivate funding for resource coordination and reduction of fragmentation among philanthropic initiatives.\nThe Division of Sustainability and Resilience will serve as the lead office for strategy implementation. The Office will also focus on four pathways to implement the strategy in year\none:\n1.\tConvene action leadership groups\n2.\tEstablish a governance and institutionalization framework\n3.\tEstablish a measurement framework\n4.\tIntegrate resilience-building into civic engagement and public events.\n7. Convene action leadership groups\nResilient Pittsburgh recognizes that the city government cannot execute this strategy alone. It was developed collaboratively as a citywide collaborative effort, and also addresses a range of regional resilience challenges. Tackling fragmentation within the city's systems and between the city and external organizations is central in the first year of strategy implementation.\nA series of events and round-tables will bring together diverse organizations working on systemic issues - for example, water quality, education, energy, and public health -to establish leadership and coordination in solving some of the city's most pressing challenges. Improved coordination will result in resource efficiency, better communication and long lasting partnerships, as well as agility across sectors for a deeper analysis of what is truly driving challenges to city resilience. Establishing leadership within topical areas is also intended to motivate both city departments and external organizations to lead implementation of the resilience strategy over the long-term.\n2.\tEstablish a governance and institutionalization framework\nInstitutionalization of the resilience focus within city government will ensure that the strategy remains relevant regardless of changes in personnel or shifts in political leadership. The location of the Division of Sustainability and Resilience within the Department of City Planning will support long-term integration of resilience by establishing formal resilience commissions and committees in the coming year.\nAs a first step. Resilient Pittsburgh will work with members of the resilience strategy steering committee to convene a governance framework group, which will provide recommendations to the Mayor for establishing commissions and implementation structures.\n3.\tEstablish a measurement framework: Pittsburgh Survey 2.0\nTo document progress and monitor the effectiveness of resilience-building initiatives and actions, the Resilient Pittsburgh team will begin to establish a measurement framework in the first year. Currently, existing information about city needs is diffused and fragmented across the city both in government and nongovernmental activities. One important ongoing measurement effort is the p4 Performance Measures Project, which aims to \"provide a comprehensive evaluation tool forthe consistentassessment of real estate development projects in the city of Pittsburgh to advance sustainable and equitable development practices.\"63 The Measures are currently in use by the URA as a new method for evaluating the benefit and impact of a site development project receiving public investment. Building upon the p4 Performance Measures and other data collection and measurement efforts underway, Pittsburgh is poised to develop a holistic and coordinated way to capture progress towards city resilience and wellbeing using a more integrated survey method.\nA \"Pittsburgh Survey, 2.0\", which is inspired by a groundbreaking survey of city residents administered over a century ago, will address some of the challenges identified in this implementation section.64 It will serve as a comprehensive information system to align and support Pittsburgh's initiatives (at the public level, while also available to private entities, non-profits, and foundations) from now through 2030.\nThe Survey will become the central monitoring and evaluation mechanism for the implementation of this resilience strategy. It will centrally track existing secondary and administrative data that supports resilience and identify places where new or primary data collection is needed. The Survey will include core resilience and related wellbeing objectives, organize relevantactions like those in the strategy, and offer a foundation of data to link the effectiveness and efficiency of current investments, initiatives, policies, and programs to support resilience and wellbeing in Pittsburgh.\n4.\tIntegrate resilience into civic engagement and public events\nTo bring resilience into prominence in the larger city narrative, the Resilient Pittsburgh team will integrate\nresilience-building into civic engagement initiatives and existing events. In year one. Love Your Resilient Block grants will fund community-driven projects that address the city's resilience challenges at the neighborhood level.\nResilience Fairs and a series of citywide events will leverage partnerorganizations'ongoing resilience-building initiatives. By utilizing partnerships. Resilient Pittsburgh will connect with regional audiences and engage residences, businesses, and institutions in learning about and celebrating resilience in all facets of life in Pittsburgh.\nOverall, near-term implementation will focus heavily on institutionalization and reducing fragmentation in both government and nongovernmental areas, fostering a regional atmosphere of collaborative problem solving and resource coordination. Year one of implementation is about bringing people, neighborhoods, and organizations together aswe prepare to address the future uncertain challenges that all Pittsburghers will face from climate change, globalization, and urbanization.\nNEIGHBORHOOD RESILIENCE IN ACTION: One Northside\nLONG-TERM IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS\nThe Pittsburgh resilience strategy requires a comprehensive implementation plan to support uptake, integration, and long-term sustainability. There are several ways in which the strategy could be propelled to advance its vision and objectives but also areas that could impede implementation, particularly after the initial activities are complete. We briefly describe each of the factors that will support implementation over the next several years and then discuss measures to monitor long-term progress towards strategy goals and objectives.These measures will be included in the Pittsburgh Survey, described earlier.\nCoordination among government and nongovernmental sectors\nCoordination among government and nongovernmental sectors is central, particularly because the strategy relies on integrated actions by many sectors and stakeholders working together. As such, each action group will require lead and supporting actors who will contribute to its achievement. Further, coordination will be required to determine how the range of government agencies, nonprofits, businesses, and other organizations will integrate the strategy and its objectives into their core missions and organizational plans.\nIn the context of coordination, it is also important to consider the governance structures that will appropriately \"scaffold\" the strategy, that is, help build robust and usable plans for decision-making, prioritization of actions, and resource allocation. This also includes careful planning around leadership, including how the city provides leadership to the strategy and how community leaders can serve as ambassadors for the strategy's goals and objectives over time.\nResource allocation and a cohesive investment framework Clearly, dedicated resources (both fiscal and non-fiscal) are important when a new endeavor like the resilience strategy is introduced. However, implementation is not simply about raising funds or increasing funding levels. Rather, it is important to understand how resources already allocated in existing budgets (government and non-government) support the strategy's objectives. For example, Pittsburgh's capital budget can be reviewed in light of resilience priorities (see example in the callout box).\nCASE STUDY FOR CITY OF PITTSBURGH CAPITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS: ASSESSING UTILITY BILLS IN THE CONTEXT OF RESILIENCE\nThe City of Pittsburgh owns and maintains 139 municipal buildings and dozens of additional assets for which it must pay monthly operating expenses. Utility bills represent one significant recurring expense: in 2016, the city expects to pay around $4.2 million, $1.1 million, and $370,000, respectively, for electricity, natural gas, and water. To maintain its assets, the city makes capital investments, which may lead to reductions in monthly utility bills. To assess the relative impact of these capital investments on Pittsburgh's resilience, the city could conduct several different analyses, each leading to different answers regarding the\"best\"actions\/decisions. It is useful to articulate how resilience outcome metrics can be mapped to the allocation of funding for capital investments across the city's many building and structural assets. Some of the budgeting approaches could focus on strengthening city resilience through general efficiency, while others are about identifying resilience co-benefits from single investment choices or budget re-allocation. We use the utility budget to illustrate each approach.\nCost-benefit analysis and action to build basic resilience and energy efficiency: Using readily available data, city assets could be ranked in terms of attributes such as the absolute size of the utility bills and the building age, size, structure type, or other physical characteristics. Based on this type of information, capital funding could be allocated to building projects that, for example, would lead to the greatest net reduction in monthly utility bills (such as the biggest economic\"bang for the buck\") or the maximum economic benefit per unit cost of capital improvement investment. Table 1 provides examples of goals, associated metrics, and assets that would first be considered with this focus.\nTable 1. Example energy efficiency goals, metrics, and assets for investment\nResilience-focused analysis and action with attention to resilience co-benefits: By collecting and utilizing additional quantitative and qualitative data on socioeconomics and community resources and assets (for example, household surveys), or incorporating information on externalities (for example, greenhouse gas footprint or intensity), a more sophisticated approach to investment can be made using the \"resilience lens.\"The portfolio of investments selected by considering a broader set of metrics and assessing the corresponding quantitative and qualitative data would likely not be the same as those selected with economic cost-benefit analysis alone. In this case, metrics would need to be expanded to a more holistic and complete list that captures all facets of city resilience, and co-benefits would be explicitly considered.\nFor example, if the city wanted to prioritize the improvement and functionality of emergency response services, it might choose to focus on these assets first. In this case, the \"Medic 10\" facility\u2014with the highest total energy bill and dramatically higher per-square-foot energy intensity among emergency medical services facilities, which the city owns and maintains5\u2014might be the clear choice. Although this facility is not the most obvious target across the full set of city assets from a total energy cost perspective, it has high per-square-foot energy intensity and provides the potential co-benefit of enhancing emergency response services that operate out of this facility.\nThere are many instances within this strategy that suggest new ways to align resources with programs and policies already in place. The action taxonomy offered below (Figure 25)\u2014initiate, coordinate, amplify, and accelerate\u2014is a useful way to categorize resource decisions. Some actions will require concentrated resources to amplify or accelerate progress. Other actions will benefit from coordination of resources from across government and nongovernmental sectors.\nIn general, this resilience strategy can be thought of as an investment framework or prospectus for private and public sector entities in Pittsburgh. The main goals of the strategy (for example. People) along with the detailed objectives inform areas in which sector-specific investments may be needed and co-benefits from investments could be realized. Many of the maps indicating where assets are low and vulnerabilities are high also suggest places for targeted investment.\nCommunity awareness and ongoing education Another factor that will facilitate effective implementation is continued dialogue about why resilience matters, how a resilience lens for existing and new programs and investments moves beyond traditional silos, and what benefits or co-benefits strategy implementation could achieve. Without the consistent engagement of Pittsburgh stakeholders, it will be difficult to advance interestand active participation in the strategy and realization of its vision. This includes ongoing efforts and the post-strategy launch to keep community members connected to the strategy. This education campaign may require new engagement strategies, use of diverse media approaches, and ongoing analysis of how the strategy is being received, adopted, and integrated by different constituencies.\nTargeted partner building\nWhile coordination, resource allocation, and education are critical for implementation, these are not sufficient in themselves to support implementation of a strategy that is holistic and integrated into whole-of-city planning and policy development. Targeted actions and investments that facilitate new and, in some cases, unusual collaborations, are essential for breaking down silos that may impede integrated efforts to achieve some of the strategy objectives.\nSuccessful implementation will also depend on lessons\nlearned, information sharing, and peer city support through city-to-city networks. Existing networks like 100RC, the National League of Cities, Urban Sustainability Directors Network, Sister Cities, the Mayors' Compact on Climate Change, and the Pennsylvania League of Cities and Municipalities are important exemplars that Pittsburgh is already actively engaged with.\nMEASURING PROGRESS\nAs described above, ongoing measurement and regular analysis and use of the data collected will be central to successful implementation. The resilience objectives and actions provide a way to measure strategy progress. There are three approaches for strategy evaluation. First, each of the objectives can be linked to metrics that assess both process and outcomes. This will help Pittsburgh determine whether the city is becoming more resilient in key areas. (Table 2).\nSecond, the strategy will also need to track how particular actions are implemented against community readiness and the appropriateness or each action for adoption or uptake. The city will also want to track how well that process is taking shape. For example, how well are new actions initiated; is there better coordination among existing actions; are current actions being amplified to meet new populations; and are particular actions being accelerated to speed up adoption? (Table 3)\nFinally, while tables like the one above are useful for tracking progress from specific goal to objective to resilience outcomes, they do not include critical monitoring of whether the strategy as a whole continues to meet its larger vision of making Pittsburgh more resilient to a range of shocks and stresses. As such, it will be important use a more overarching evaluation to determine how the systems and sectors that support resilience are also progressing institutionally. For example, key questions may include:\n\u2022\tDo all sectors across Pittsburgh and regionally integrate resilience as a core principle of mission, vision, and operating efforts? How is that attention to resilience represented?\n\u2022\tIs there more effective and efficient coordination among agencies and organizations to pursue resilience goals and objectives?\n\u2022 Is there better communication and partnership among agencies and organizations?\nOverall, this chapter provides a clear set of near-term steps to support successful strategy implementation and outlines critical organizational and community factors that are required to build Pittsburgh's resilience. Integration and alignment of metrics and evaluation activities across city departments and organizations will be central to achieving the primary goal and objectives of this resilience strategy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Pittsburgh resilience strategy establishes a bold vision forthe city, building on the successes in recent decades and a wealth of community assets while directly confronting the complex challenges that the city continues to face. The resilience strategy is greater than a single initiative or plan. It is a guide for city decisions and expectations, and is built to be sustainable over time. The strategy will help Pittsburgh realize the central purpose of a thriving city in the 21st century: to create conditions in which every resident can flourish in the face of challenges and a community that can effectively respond and recover in any circumstance.\nThe strategy comes at a critical period in Pittsburgh's history, in which choices made today about globalization, urbanization, climate change, equity, and economic progress will set a trajectory for generations to come. It acknowledges the complex interconnections among city challenges, with social, economic, and environmental effects resulting from every major decision. As such, siloed and single-sector actions are not sufficient, and city government cannot solve problems alone. Instead, a vast array of unique contributions from government and nongovernmental organizations needs to be harnessed to build on Pittsburgh's strengths, minimize its vulnerabilities, and help the city more effectively and cooperatively towards resilience goals.\nThe strategy makes organization and governance central to its successful implementation, evidenced by resilience actions like the Pittsburgh Survey 2.0 and other initiatives to align actions and measurement. It recognizes that the sustainability of the strategy over the long term will be rooted in a foundation of near-term achievements. As this strategy is implemented and cross-sector coordination improves, Pittsburgh will have more tools and capabilities to support its residents in addressing a range of shocksand stressesand in ensuring that basic needs are met. These efforts will not stop at the city borders, but are intended to provide benefits for residents across the metropolitan region. In a resilient Pittsburgh, basic needs will be met for all, and residents can pursue opportunity for themselves and their families. Successful implementation of the strategy means that Pittsburgh as a community can fully realize its aims to be inclusive, celebrate diversity, and promote innovation and sustainable development.","ENTITIES":{"LOCATION":["Vietnam","Biophilic City LEAD City","Allegheny","Pittsburgh","U.S.","South Hills","PENNSYLVANIA","California","Washington","City","PITTSBURGH","Oakland","the

In the wake of this tragedy, we began to define what it means to be a resilient city. Our ability to not only bounce back, but rather bounce forward, has been a theme and a spirit that has carried us through other challenges over the years. We stand together now to make San Francisco a city that everyone can have an opportunity to call home.\nDuring my time as the City Administrator, I began to institutionalize resilience by launching several programs aimed at preparing our residents, buildings and infrastructure to be ready for the challenges of the next century. We are strengthening our buildings to be ready for future earthquakes; we have developed an action plan to address rising sea levels; and we are committed to housing production, protection of our residents, education, and sustainable jobs to help shore up our social fabric that makes our community thrive because of its diversity.\nResilient San Francisco was developed over the course of 18\nmonths through a process that involved more than 186 individuals,\n31 government agencies, and 56 NGO and private sector organizations. It lays out the City\u2019s resilience goals that we will continue to track and measure as we update this living document to ensure the City is working together with our communities, and continuing to work diligently toward these goals. San Francisco is a resilient city, but we must not forget what is at stake.\nThese challenges present opportunities to leverage our ideas, people, and culture to continue to build and protect our San Francisco for generations to come.\nSan Francisco\u2019s resilience will ultimately be defined and measured by the ability of its residents, businesses and government to quickly\nrespond to and effectively recover from an event. We must remember that, although earthquakes are San Francisco\u2019s most immediate identifiable threat, there are and will continue to be other environmental stresses and challenges that impact our capacity and resilience as a city and region.\nImproving the City\u2019s individual systems and structures will increase the City\u2019s resilience overall. That is why resilience must be a multi-pronged strategy focused on establishing a framework by which we can ensure that the decisions we make are based on an integrated approach that will yield multiple benefits today and tomorrow.\nResilient San Francisco is about identifying our vulnerabilities, implementing strategies and programs that further the City\u2019s resilience and capacity, and tracking our overall progress and performance in meeting our identified resilience goals to ensure our accountability.\nSan Francisco is filled with dedicated individuals working hard to make a difference. We are taking an integrated approach to resilience that will\nbetter prepare us for the uncertainties of tomorrow. That is at the core of resilience thinking. Understanding urban resilience is like recognizing the difference between learning and education. Building resilience is an ongoing process like learning, not a milestone like a graduation or another traditional educational goal. Every day we are actively learning from our experiences, and this is a process that never stops. Resilience is something that we must constantly strive toward, a process, and this strategy provides a road map to help our City and our communities continue on a path to a more resilient future.\nPatrick Otellini Chief Resilience Officer\nNaomi M. Kelly, City Administrator\nINTRODUCTION\nSan Francisco has never been a sleepy town. We are no strangers to change, to reimagination, to bold vision. Since the 1906 earthquake and fire, the 110th anniversary of which this strategy commemorates, we have faced countless challenges. In the century since that disaster, San Francisco has remade itself time and time again. Our city is both a capital of innovation and a flashpoint for many of the country\u2019s most daunting urban struggles. It is a city with a long history of advocacy and acceptance, and a city that struggles with its own contemporary identity. San Francisco has never shied away from hard questions, tough tasks or complicated reality, though. Today\u2019s San Francisco is\u2014and will be\u2014no different.\nCities around the world are grappling with the realities of climate change and rising seas, escalating urbanization and increasingly frequent disruptions of daily life. Here in San Francisco, we are struggling with how the hazards we face\u2014and our response to them\u2014expose several interdependencies that we must better understand. What is 21st century San Francisco? To whom will this city be available? How can we maintain our San Francisco values and, perhaps, make them even stronger?\nRESILIENT-SF is a strategy that seeks to tap into our city\u2019s trademark tenacity by laying out our most pressing challenges and demanding that City government partner with the community to make bold and lasting progress on these challenges. When we think about San Francisco, we think of a city of unwavering strength, a city that is prepared to not only respond but to recover, and a San Francisco of strong and unified neighborhoods, ready to continue reimagining, and striving for the strong and resilient San Francisco of tomorrow.\nSF@1M\nThe Association of Bay Area Governments projects that the population of San Francisco will grow to 1 million, and the Bay Area will grow to 7.2 million\nresidents by 2040. This requires our planning to consider this additional capacity. But San Francisco is growing at a rate that projects 1 million residents by 2040. This idea of San Francisco at 1 million residents (or SF@1M) appears throughout this strategy, and reminds us that we need to consider adding additional capacity when needed and to look for more opportunities to take an integrated approach. We cannot just plan for our needs of today but rather must work together to plan for the needs of a growing population: SF@1M.\nWe face several interconnected challenges:\nEARTHQUAKES\nThere is a 76 percent chance the Bay Area will experience a 7.0 magnitude earthquake\nin the next 30 years. Even the relatively moderate and distant 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake (6.9) caused substantial damage to our city. It is imperative to the survival of San Francisco that we continue working to prepare for and recover from the \u201cbig one.\u201d\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nThe impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the form of drought\nand increasingly severe storm events.\nWe must secure our city\u2019s future through mitigation, while recognizing the likely impacts of climate change by beginning to adapt today rather than when it is too late.\nSEA LEVEL RISE\nWe expect a total of 66 inches of sea level rise to impact our shores by 2100.\nAs we plan for the growth of our city, we need to adapt to this challenge that threatens not only our waterfront but also our way of life in San Francisco and regionally.\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nInfrastructure is central to our daily lives\u2014from the roads and pipes we use\nevery day, to the larger systems, like food, social networks and housing that we rely on as lifelines. Sometimes these systems continue to operate past their intended life span, and sometimes they are inadequate altogether to meet the needs of a growing and vibrant city.\nSOCIAL INEQUITY\nSan Francisco embraces equality and equity in all policies, but this\nwork is never done. Social equity and inclusiveness need to be at the core of what makes a city thrive.\nUNAFFORDABILITY\nForty-five percent of renters in San Francisco pay more than 30 percent of their\nhousehold income in rent. Median home prices are continuing to rise, making it a challenge for first-time homebuyers.\nSan Francisco is becoming out of reach for many of the people who made the city what it is today.\nOUR STRATEGY, OUR CHALLENGES AND OUR GOALS\nWith an eye toward both process and product, we take a long view of resilience. What will San Francisco be like with nearly 160,000 new residents? How will population growth impact the challenges we already face? What new challenges will we face, and what strengths will SF@1M add to our city by 2040? And, most importantly, how can we begin to accommodate this growth, while facing both the challenges of today and tomorrow?\nWe have determined four actionable goals to address those challenges. Each goal was formed from, and will be supported by, leveraging successful City department-level initiatives, as well as supporting efforts (e.g., department studies, existing projects) within each goal\u2019s policy area:\nPlan and Prepare for Tomorrow\nSan Francisco\u2019s challenges build slowly and quickly, steadily and suddenly. This goal looks toward building our city\u2019s capacity to handle today\u2019s challenges and tomorrow\u2019s disasters. We address land use planning and recovery planning, as well as earthquake planning and preparedness.\nMitigate, Adapt and Retrofit\nWe face a future with certain challenges. This goal looks to confront the pressing realities of an imminent large earthquake, a changing climate and rising seas, all while building a stronger city today.\nEnsure Housing for San Franciscans Today\nand After a Disaster\nToday\u2019s challenges will only worsen with tomorrow\u2019s disruptions. We must work now to ensure housing for all San Franciscans before and after a disaster. We will work to address our city\u2019s housing and homeless crises through innovative policies, reimagining and bold action to build a stronger city for today and tomorrow.\nEmpower Neighbors and Neighborhoods\nthrough Improved Connections\nSan Francisco is a city of neighborhoods and neighbors. This goal seeks to build on the strength of our city\u2019s character and vibrancy, by being effective governmental stewards of resilient, healthy and cohesive neighborhoods based in trust, equity and partnership.\nThis strategy has the power to transform San Francisco. Ultimately, though, effective implementation is paramount. Clear, actionable steps are the foundation of urban resilience, building momentum and continual support for the work we do. These goals can only be achieved if the City partners with communities to take a stand and make the hard decisions necessary to secure a better future for all San Franciscans. Some of the hallmark actions this strategy will take include...\n\u25a0\tA new Office of Resilience and Recovery\n\u25a0\tCreate capacity to house a population expected to grow to 1 million residents by 2040.\n\u25a0\tA disaster housing and governance plan for long-term recovery\n\u25a0\tLaunching a regional resilience design challenge\n\u25a0\tConstructing a disaster-resilient waterfront by 2040\n\u25a0\tSeismic retrofit of vulnerable buildings and set a higher level of safety for new buildings\n\u25a0\tAdvance Citywide adaptation planning for sea level rise\nThis strategy cannot fix every problem or answer every question. But it prioritizes the challenges we face, tackling them with bold goals and decisive action. As we approach SF@1M, it takes a hard look at our transportation and land use planning, our disaster and recovery planning, our climate readiness and critical neighborhood programs. Foremost, this strategy is intended to foster dialogue between San Francisco government and the community, between departments within San Francisco government, between cities in the region, between neighbors. To advance progress on these challenges, we have created a strategy consisting of:\nHow to read this strategy\nSan Francisco is a world leader in innovation, in social justice advocacy, in livable and sustainable urbanism.\nAs a city, we have a long history of coming together to fight for a better future, not only for our city but the world. Our city also sits at the precipice of great challenges. How can we face these challenges, while becoming more equitable and affordable, stronger and empowered, and also more prepared? How can we look toward San Francisco at 1 million residents, or SF@1M, as we are calling this important milestone, and not only maintain our San Francisco values, but build on them?\nFour goals seeking to address six key challenges that face San Francisco\nfrom stressors or long-term challenges to shocks or disaster events.\nEach goal contains a series of actions aimed at making\nprogress on the goals.\nA series of metrics allows us to evaluate progress on the goals; and\nA set of existing, supporting\nand new initiatives\nRESILIENCE FOR SAN FRANCISCO\nResilience describes the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt and grow, no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience. Approaching challenges through the lens of resilience helps cities better serve their residents today and plan for the longer term. Resilience demands moving beyond reaction through proactive planning. The approach calls for considering problems systematically, seeking out departmental and conceptual relationships from which solutions can be more completely developed, and bridging the practice gaps between social justice, sustainability, disaster recovery and other areas.\nResilience is Process-Oriented\nFor San Francisco, resilience is as much about process as about product. Our desire is to build a strong culture of resilience, a culture where varied challenges are approached strategically\u2014both through bold goal-setting and in an integrated manner, where co-benefits and comprehensive solutions are identified and implemented through stakeholder collaboration. This strategy seeks to institutionalize and embed this culture within our City government and our neighborhoods. It will serve as the ongoing centerpiece of an interdepartmental dialogue and an extensive, yearlong community workshop process, all through a new Office of Resilience and Recovery under the Office of the City Administrator.\nStronger Today, Stronger Tomorrow\nFor San Francisco, resilience begins with questions concerning recovery, but it certainly does not stop there. Today\u2019s weaknesses will become tomorrow\u2019s disasters. Disasters are not the disruptions that knock us down, but rather they are born from long-standing crises that keep us from getting back up again. This demands that we ask: Are we strong today? And, in the ways we are not, how can we begin to address these weaknesses today, before they become tomorrow\u2019s disruptions? We know an earthquake is coming, and we know climate change will bring strong and lasting changes to our way of life here in San Francisco. We know that a robust economy still exists in a boom and bust cycle. These facts, these questions, and the knowledge that SF@1M is just around the corner, pose a challenge\u2014a challenge to think more comprehensively, to consider integrating ideas, partners and departments more closely, and to plan for a stronger today and a stronger tomorrow. This is our San Francisco baseline for understanding and implementing resilience.\nAN INTEGRATED APPROACH\nAt all stages of the resilience-building process, our focus is on taking an integrated approach. An integrated approach looks at systems and linkages\u2014specifically, it requires thinking about relationships between departments, between the government and residents, between the public sector and academia, between the public and private sectors, between problems. We are looking for co-benefits\u2014moments when one solution, or a set of solutions, contributes to progress on multiple problems. We look past silos, trying to find connections and redundancies. We look outside the normal processes and ask: How can we do this better?\nCREATING OUR RESILIENCE STRATEGY\nOne Hundred Resilient Cities (100RC)\u2014Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation\u2014kicked off in 2013, connecting cities around the world to the funding necessary to hire a Chief Resilience Officer, as well as the technical assistance necessary to advance resilience. San Francisco was one of the cities selected in the first round of the 100RC initiative, and over the course of the last 18 months, we have met and worked with more than 30 government agencies, and over 50 community-based organizations and private sector partners, to develop an actionable strategy aimed at understanding and then advancing urban resilience in San Francisco and regionally.\nThese working groups leveraged expertise, while building relationships and beginning a new chapter in the dialogue around resilience in San Francisco. Workshops with our partners, community groups and City officials allowed experts within individual fields, departments and policy areas to add their understanding of resilience and the needs of the City to the process. These workshops were the beginning of an iterative process; stakeholders were engaged at the various steps of translating the content of the meetings into the strategy itself.\nThe City has also collaborated with and learned from other\nparticipating cities around the world, from Rotterdam and Christchurch to cities closer to home, like Los Angeles, Oakland and Berkeley. These cities approach resilience-building in their own context, but all cities have common threads of doing what we can now to help us face an uncertain future. Working together helps us find new and more creative solutions to address the challenges each city faces.\nA Call to Community-Led Action\nNow is the time to act! This strategy and its implementation have the power to transform San Francisco\u2014not just in what we do but in how we do it. Ultimately, though, this strategy lives and dies on the work that can and will be done. Clear, actionable steps forward are the foundation of urban resilience, building momentum and continual support for the work we all share. Each of these goals can only be met if the City works hand in hand with our community to take a stand and make the hard decisions necessary to secure a better future for all San Franciscans as we approach SF@1M. These are the indicators of progress that will guide the implementation of this work.\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery\nWith the launch of this strategy comes the founding of a new office within the San Francisco City Administrator\u2019s Office\u2014the Office of Resilience and Recovery. This office will be charged with managing the city\u2019s ongoing resilience challenge, and with championing our city\u2019s earthquake preparedness and recovery work. This challenge involves working across departments and agencies to determine and continue clear action, to build the narrative around resilience internally, and to find connection points with ongoing strategic planning and comprehensive planning processes.\nAccountability and Transparency\u2014Annual Strategy Updates\nWith the launch of this strategy and the formation of the Office of Resilience and Recovery, we are partnering with Neighborland, a platform for collaboration, and Appallicious, a data collection company, to launch a citywide, neighborhood by neighborhood, community engagement process. We will present the strategy to community leaders, as well as members of the public, to workshop it, to improve upon it, to add to it and to tell us what we missed or should do differently. Additionally, the ORR will update the strategy annually, in order to measure the progress the City is making toward its bold goals. These processes will form an even stronger strategy, working with the community and our partners within government, to advance and build a strong culture of resilience in San Francisco.\nGOAL 1\nPLAN AND^^H\nPREPARE FOR TOMORROW\nACTIONS:\nTo meet this goal, we will:\n1.\tPrepare Today for San Francisco\u2019s Recovery\n2.\tAdvance Innovations in Earthquake Preparedness\n3.\tInvest in Infrastructure and Transportation for Our Growing City\nIntroduction\nFor San Francisco, challenges are opportunities. By planning and preparing for tomorrow, we build a stronger and more resilient city today\u2014one ready for SF@1M, and ready for any crisis ahead. Each improvement we plan, and each one we make, from earthquakes to our housing stock and urban form, and to our infrastructure and transportation, transforms San Francisco into a more flexible and dynamic city for today and tomorrow.\nSan Francisco has always been a city living on the edge\u2014on the edge of the next global innovation; on the edge of social change and reinvention; and on the edge of peril, from earthquakes. With an uncertain global future, marked by a changing climate, growing unaffordability and inequality, and the certainty of a powerful earthquake, San Francisco is ready to take decisive and bold actions to maintain our most important values, while building the stronger, more equitable and prepared San Francisco.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates we have a 72 percent chance of a 6.7 magnitude or greater earthquake in the next 29 years. The population of San Francisco is growing at a rate of 10,000 new residents a year. At the same time, median rent has doubled in the last five years. Like cities all over the world, San Francisco is struggling with both chronic, day-to-day challenges and the threat of large-scale disasters. The time to act is now, because today\u2019s weaknesses are tomorrow\u2019s disasters.\nThe Central Subway Project will construct a modern, efficient light-rail line that will improve public transportation in San Francisco. This new 1.7-mile extension of Muni\u2019s T Third Line will provide direct connections to major retail, sporting and cultural venues, while efficiently transporting people to jobs, educational opportunities and other amenities throughout the city.\nWe must continue to improve services, while thoughtfully planning for the San Francisco of tomorrow. To become resilient, we must foster a culture within government that considers the interaction between long-range planning, recovery planning and the day-to-day work in neighborhoods. We must ready ourselves for earthquakes by planning for response, mitigation and recovery. And finally, we must build a more sustainable and livable city. This chapter seeks to leverage existing actions and continue the emerging strategic dialogue among city leaders, which the Office of Resilience and Recovery hopes to help build. Integration is vital to the work of resilience-searching cooperatively for co-benefits whenever and wherever possible, thinking strategically about short- and long-term problem solving, and always considering multiple hazards.\nKEY INDICATORS:\nTo measure progress, San Francisco will:\n\u25a0\tComplete a long-term disaster recovery governance plan by 2018.\n\u25a0\tTrain 2,000 Neighborhood Emergency Response Team members by 2018.\n\u25a0\tCreate a post-earthquake building re-occupancy tool by 2017.\n\u25a0\tBuild and develop a more robust preparedness culture focused on training all levels of city management\u2014 not just emergency managers\u2014\non response protocols and actions.\n\u25a0\tInvest in infrastructure that increases mobility capacity and usage, while decreasing the distance to essential services.\nA multiagency post-earthquake inspection exercise took place at City Hall during an already scheduled building evacuation exercise where inspectors practiced response protocols. More of this kind of training will better prepare us for future disasters.\nINITIATIVE 1.1\nBuild Community Readiness through Education and Technology\nWhen disaster strikes, San Franciscans must join together to begin the recovery process. To facilitate this through preparedness, the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management (DEM) has developed a next-generation preparation and community-building platform called \u201cSF72.\u201d SF72 builds on other services DEM already offers, like AlertSF, which allows community members to receive alerts regarding emergencies disrupting vehicular\/pedestrian traffic, watches and warnings for tsunamis, flooding and Citywide post-disaster information. These services and platforms have the capacity to build community, while fostering a culture of preparedness.\nSF72 helps residents become more prepared, connects them and can serve as a post-disaster information\nhub. With tools like these, as well as DEM\u2019s regular exercises and communication with the public\u2014regarding everything from a winter storm to a gas leak downtown to a Giant\u2019s game\u2014San Francisco can begin to build a deep-seated culture of preparedness.\nAlertSF is a text-based notification system for San Francisco\u2019s residents and visitors. AlertSF will send alerts regarding emergencies disrupting\nvehicular\/pedestrian traffic, watches and warnings for tsunamis, flooding\nand Citywide post-disaster information to your registered wireless devices and email accounts.\nAbove: Community members and City agencies prepare through activations using the Incident Command System (ICS). SF-Prepared provides valuable training to assist the finance and administration branch when using ICS in a disaster.\nRight: San Francisco\u2019s organized response to the Rim Fire contributed to protection of the City\u2019s water supply that comes from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir.\nINITIATIVE 1.2\nEnsure Effective City Operations during Response and Recovery\nThe ability to continue with financial operations is a critical component to ensuring an effective post-disaster response. Under the Office of the Controller, SF-Prepared is helping San Francisco and other Bay Area cities to plan for an effective Citywide recovery through the financial and administrative tools needed for emergency response and recovery. San Francisco government agencies will leverage SF-Prepared to continue financial operations during a disaster or other disruption. We need to continue to implement SF-Prepared within the city\u2019s day-to-day operations, including the training of all city departmental CFOs in postdisaster cost-recovery processes.\nINITIATIVE 1.3\nIncrease Training for Neighborhood Emergency Response Teams\n\u2018\u2018Beginning with ourselves, we will be prepared and work as an individual or together as emergency response teams to assist our families and neighbors in time of disaster, and to be prepared to make decisions that do the Most Good for the Most People.\u201d\n\u2014NERT Mission statement\nIn the coming year, Neighborhood Emergency Response Teams (NERT) aim to have 2,000 additional residents sign up for training or renew their existing certifications. By 2025, NERT plans to grow the number of trained residents overall by 30 percent. The new Office of Resilience and Recovery will provide additional support to the SFFD-NERT by partnering in a Citywide outreach campaign to help inform more residents about this free training opportunity. NERT will also further leverage the Office of Civic Innovation\u2019s Startup in Residence Program (STIR) to help develop a streamlined, web-based registration process, freeing up staff to spend more time on program development and community outreach.\nNERT is a free training program for individuals, neighborhood groups and community-based organizations run by the San Francisco Fire Department. The program teaches community members the basics of personal preparedness, as well as the hands-on disaster skills necessary to assist the Fire Department in responding to all levels of emergencies. The program was born of proven necessity. During the magnitude-6.9 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, which shook a significant portion of the Marina District to the ground, San Franciscans immediately took to the streets to help their neighbors. This program, with its 27,000 residents trained since 1990, builds on that tradition of neighbors helping neighbors.\nINTEGRATION\nBuild a More Complete First Response After a Disaster\nThe Department of Public Health (DPH) will continue to work with NERT to train volunteers on psychological first aid, building a more comprehensive response after a disaster. After a disaster, many members of our community will be in crisis. To build back quickly, and stronger, our neighbors will need a helping hand to get back on their feet. With this in mind, in 2015 DPH worked with the\nnonprofit San Francisco Community Agencies Responding to Disasters (SFCARD) to develop a Psychological First Aid Training curriculum that was piloted as a Train the Trainers Psychological First Aid Training for NERT volunteers. This training will roll out to new neighborhoods in the coming months as part of a comprehensive outreach program.\n\u201cAs an immigrant, San Francisco represents a safe harbor\u2014a place where diversity and differences are not seen as challenges, but rather assets that strengthen the community.\u201d\n\u2014Michael Liao\nChinatown Disaster Preparedness Committee NICOS Chinese Health Coalition and NERT leader\nINITIATIVE 1.4\nExpand Access to Health Facilities and Services for Our Most in Need\nThe City will invest $350 million to expand access to mental health services for San Franciscans, including the homeless, and seismically upgrade and strengthen the City\u2019s public health care facilities and emergency medical response infrastructure to ensure their viability after a major earthquake. Specifically, the funds will be spent on additional earthquake safety upgrades to the San Francisco General Hospital, on neighborhood health clinics, on expanding services at homeless shelters, and on retrofitting Fire Department and ambulance facilities.\nThis work builds on existing efforts to repair and strengthen our City\u2019s health care and emergency medical services infrastructure, as outlined in the City\u2019s 10-Year Capital Plan. Protecting public health, expanding mental health and\nhomeless services, and improving community safety in the event of an emergency are major focal points for aiding in our City\u2019s recovery. By upgrading these health and safety facilities, San Francisco can help protect our residents, neighborhoods and small businesses.\nINITIATIVE 1.5\nDevelop a Long-Term Recovery Governance Plan\nMost major urban areas have established emergency response protocols. After a disaster, however, cities often have problems bridging the gap between response and long-term recovery. By 2018, San Francisco will create a longterm plan that lays out both a vision and goals aimed at effective and inclusive governance, cost recovery, strategic partnerships, data collection and overall planning for the City.\nThis governance and cost-recovery strategic plan will assess the City\u2019s current policies, procedures, authorities and tools, identifying what works, what\u2019s missing and what needs to be modified. The aim is to best position the City to fully and quickly recover its eligible postdisaster expenses. Post-disaster cost recovery is complex and spans far beyond the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Public Assistance Program, including interaction with over 50 different funding sources. City operations are also a complex matter day to day. This plan aims to ensure San Franciscans have the services they need as they get back on their feet.\nINITIATIVE 1.6\nActively Coordinate for Recovery with Our Private and Public Utilities\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery will partner with the\nSan Francisco Lifelines Council to continue to study the geographic \u201cchoke point\u201d areas, where infrastructure restoration is more challenging because of heavy concentration and interdependency.\nThe Lifelines Council will also continue to enhance the coordination of disaster planning and preparedness efforts among lifeline providers\u2014 those that supply the City with its most critical services (e.g., water, electricity and internet). At the same time, the Lifelines Council will continue to advance mitigation efforts that could collectively improve lifeline system performance in the City after future disasters. When the City Administrator\u2019s Office initiated The Lifelines Council in 2009, it started an important dialogue.\nThe Lifelines Council is made up of both private and public utility providers, first responders and senior public sector officials, who together work to ensure that our City and the region can recover quickly from unexpected disruptions. The Office of Resilience and Recovery will help the Council as it looks to complete implementation of its Five-Year Plan, including the efforts listed above, by 2019.\n\u201cLifelines are the systems and facilities that provide services vital to the function of an industrialized society and are important to the emergency response and recovery after a natural disaster. These systems and facilities include communication, electric power, liquid fuel, natural gas, transportation (airports, highways, ports, rail and transit), water and wastewater\u201d\nThe San Francisco Lifelines Council coordinates City response and recovery with our private sector utility providers.\n-American Society of Civil Engineering Technical Council on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering (TCLEE), 2009\nContinue the Earthquake Safety Implementation Program\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery will oversee and advance the 30-year, 5O-task Earthquake Safety Implementation Program (ESIP), a comprehensive plan to address the City\u2019s most pressing earthquake risks. ESIP, as it did with 2013\u2019s Mandatory Soft Story Retrofit Program, works directly with community members to develop earthquake risk reduction public policy.\nCAPSS Background\nIn the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, the City launched the Community Action Plan for Seismic Safety (CAPSS) initiative. CAPSS provided City\nagencies and policymakers with a community-driven plan to reduce future earthquake risks in existing, privately owned buildings, and to develop repair and rebuilding guidelines to expedite recovery. Over the course of 10 years, the CAPSS project team\u2014along with an advisory panel of over 60 stakeholders, community leaders, professional\nexperts and City staff\u2014met regularly to review and discuss the best methods to mitigate the potential for loss of life and property damage resulting from four potential earthquake scenarios. CAPSS built consensus around timelines for retrofitting, taking into account community feedback and feasibility.\nAnd it worked with the engineering community to reach a consensus on what types of damage would result from an expected earthquake to help level set the policy that is required to prepare the City for the next major earthquake.\nINTEGRATION\nThe Applied Technology Council (ATC) is a nonprofit, tax-exempt corporation established in 1973 through the efforts of the Structural Engineers Association of California. ATC\u2019s mission is to develop and promote state-of-the-art, user-friendly engineering resources and applications for use in mitigating the effects of natural disasters and other hazards on the built environment. ATC also identifies and encourages needed research, and develops consensus opinions on structural engineering issues in a nonproprietary format. ATC thereby fulfills a unique role in funded information transfer.\nESIP and the Applied Technology Council\nStrong and well-established partnerships with the engineering and design communities are essential in advancing earthquake innovation.\nThe City has partnered with the nonprofit Applied Technology Council (ATC) for more than a decade on building codes and earthquake-related policies, including the CAPSS study.\nATC works with ESIP to take a broad, community-focused approach, bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders to form community advisory panels, which help ensure that the City\u2019s seismic policies are representative of local concerns and needs. ESIP and ATC will examine seismic performance standards and policy recommendations focused on non-ductile concrete buildings, the earthquake readiness of our City\u2019s commercial cores, among other areas of research.\nINITIATIVE 1.8\nMitigate Earthquake Risk through the Building Code\nDamage to privately owned buildings is one of the greatest hazards resulting from a major earthquake. To build new buildings better and to prepare our existing homes, offices, shops and other structures for an earthquake, we need to reform our building code to require higher standards for building safety and postearthquake reoccupancy. ESIP will work with a coalition of City officials, design professionals and community members to amend the San Francisco Building Code by 2018 to require higher standards for new buildings, considering not only basic safety, but also post-disaster usage and occupancy.\nBuilding codes exist to set the minimum standard for buildings in a city. San Francisco, like many cities in California, has a long history of progressively amending the code to respond to local needs and pressing challenges.\nDeveloping sound policies that address both earthquake risk and the building code\u2019s real-life impact on San Franciscans requires a combination of expert-led technical development and community input. Tenant displacement, parking issues and financing options, in addition to earthquake damage risk reduction, were all considered when previous code changes were adopted. New code advancements will follow this tradition.\nThe 181 Fremont Tower was designed to significantly exceed code standards and is expected to be reoccupiable directly after a large earthquake.\nStreamline the\nProcess to Quickly Re-occupy Our Buildings\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery,\nThe Department of Building Inspection (DBI), Public Works (PW) and Emergency Management will collaborate with the Mayor\u2019s Office of Civic Innovation to build a post-earthquake building inspection tool, speeding up the building inspection and permitting process following an earthquake. Developed as part of the Startup in Residence Program (STIR), this tool will enable buildings to be quickly assessed, and then repaired and reoccupied, getting residents back in their homes easier and sooner. It builds off an existing and long-used paper process, called ATC-20, a rapid, in-field inspection tool that categorizes buildings with the familiar red, yellow and green tags. The tool, which will be ready for testing next year, will help San Francisco get back on its feet quickly\u2014allowing for fast data collection, as well as tracking of citywide damage.\nIn 2015, these departments held a joint exercise with the Office of the City Administrator and the Office of the Controller. This exercise simulated a massive earthquake striking San Francisco City Hall, with a full evacuation of the building and a mock-damage building inspection. This exercise built on the training of DBI and DPW staff. These experiences are critical to improving processes and procedures and to not only building an institutional culture of preparedness but also testing and improving processes and procedures.\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery will work with the relevant departments to hold additional exercises.\nImplement San Francisco 2050\nThe San Francisco Planning Department released its five-year work plan in 2015. The plan put forward strategies for short-term actions and long-term results, honing in on four key challenges and aspirations for San Francisco: remaining an equitable and inclusive city; access and mobility; resiliency and long-term sustainability; and placemaking. The plan approaches these key challenges and aspirations through five strategic place-based initiatives:\n\u25a0\tThe Heart of San Francisco\u2014seeking to inspire design for our city\u2019s public realm;\n\u25a0\tA Resilient Waterfront\u2014considering access to and growth along the waterfront, and the threat of sea level rise;\n\u25a0\tNext Generation SF\u2014seeking to shape and connect the growth in Southeast San Francisco;\n\u25a0\tA City of Neighborhoods\u2014looking at the diverse and distinct character of our City\u2019s neighborhoods; and\n\u25a0\tBridging the Bay\u2014collaborating across the Bay to develop a shared vision.\nThe five-year work program closely aligns with the goals of this strategy, building a strategic vision for San Francisco\u2019s future, considering the threats we face and the reality of growth as we look to SF@1M. The Office of Resilience and Recovery will support the Planning Department to integrate the work of stakeholders into this process.\nINTEGRATION\nPlan Bay Area is a long-range regional transportation, land-use, and housing strategy approved in 2013. The plan was created by the Association of Bay Area Governments and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, responding to 2008\u2019s Senate Bill 375, which calls on each of the state\u2019s 18 metropolitan areas to develop a Sustainable Communities Strategy to accommodate future population growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Working in collaboration with cities and counties, the Plan boasts initiatives to expand housing and transportation choices, create healthier communities and build a stronger regional economy by 2040.\nDevelop a 50-year Long-Range Transportation Vision\nAn interdepartmental steering committee will develop a 50-year Long-Range Transportation Vision to inform future transportation studies and investment plans, ensuring that land use, transportation and economic development in San Francisco are coordinated, consider long-range implications and inform regional planning efforts on behalf of San Francisco.\nOur aging infrastructure makes the challenge of growth more acute. The Transportation Vision seeks to ensure that all neighborhoods are more connected, that we address new and growing neighborhoods and job centers, and that we carefully consider and work to address the impacts that displacement and lack of affordability will continue to have on quality of life. Specifically, this process considers investment choices the City will be making, such as regional connections via BART, Caltrain, future High Speed Rail, improvements in local transportation, state of good repair and capacity expansion, and others.\nThe Transportation Vision will inform some of San Francisco\u2019s biggest policy questions. It will advance transportation improvements aimed at addressing congestion, getting ahead of fast growth and its impact on our city, and recognize the need to improve transit capacity.\nThe Steering Committee is represented by the Mayor\u2019s Office of Transportation Policy, SFCTA, SFMTA, SF Planning, and the Office of Economic and Workforce Development.\n(\nContinue Building and Rebuilding Infrastructure\nSan Francisco is committed to continually improving its infrastructure, knowing that it is essential to both the pressures of a growing city and the disruptions of emergencies large and small. The $32 billion FY 2016-2025 Capital Plan continues San Francisco\u2019s commitment to protecting its regional and Citywide infrastructural assets with large-scale improvements\nto the water delivery and wastewater systems, and the San Francisco International Airport. These efforts are critical to prepare our City for a strong earthquake and to increase our ability to handle the day-to-day challenges of a growing city.\nIn 2006, after decades of underfunding infrastructure, the City created its first Citywide, comprehensive, 10-year Capital Plan. The City has since received over $3 billion in voter-approved bonds for\n(1)\tearthquake safety and emergency response facilities, including a new Level 1 Trauma Center Hospital at the SFGH campus, a new Public Safety Building, and new Medical Examiner and Crime Lab facilities;\n(2)\ttransportation, road and street structure enhancements to improve public transit, pedestrian, bike, and vehicle mobility and safety; (3) park and open space improvements to address failing infrastructure, trees, restrooms and related facilities; and (4) bonds to fund additional low-and moderate-income housing.\nContinue to Push for Livable Streets\nAs the city grows and continues to serve as a job hub for the region, we must push for more livable and safer streets, with the goal of zero traffic fatalities by 2024. Vision Zero SF is the City\u2019s road safety policy that will build safety and livability into our streets, protecting our city\u2019s 1 million residents. Every year in San Francisco, about 30 people lose their lives while traveling on city streets, and over 200 more are seriously injured. These deaths and injuries are unacceptable and preventable. In 2014, the City committed to build better and safer streets, to educate the public on traffic safety, to enforce traffic laws and to adopt policy changes that save lives. Vision Zero SF will become increasingly critical as the City moves closer to SF@1M. That\u2019s why we must continue the work to create a culture that prioritizes traffic safety and ensures that mistakes on our roads don\u2019t end in serious injuries or death.\nGOAL 2\nRETROFITJ MITIGATE \u25a0 AND ADAPT\nACTIONS:\nTo meet this goal, we will:\n1.\tRetrofit Our Remaining Seismically Dangerous Buildings\n2.\tRetrofit and Rebuild Seismically Hazardous Infrastructure\n3.\tMitigate Climate Change Locally\n4.\tAdapt San Francisco to Climate Change\nIntroduction\nTo build the San Francisco of the future, we must address our City\u2019s vulnerabilities today. From retrofitting seismically weak buildings to mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases, to adapting to the reality of rising seas and a changing climate, there is much we must do to achieve the goal of a sustainable future.\nOur City has a proud history of tackling major challenges head-on. And our response to climate change and the ever-present threat of a large earthquake is no exception. But as we look forward to SF@1M, how can we build a better and more prepared San Francisco? How can we help our City handle the challenges of today and, at the same time, prepare for the challenges of tomorrow?\nKEY INDICATORS\nTo measure progress, San Francisco will:\n\u25a0\tRetrofit the homes of 180,000 San Franciscans by 2025.\n\u25a0\tReach our greenhouse gas reduction goals by 2025, through\nzero waste, 50 percent of all trips on sustainable transportation and 100 percent renewable sources of energy.\n\u25a0\tComplete a disaster-resilient waterfront by 2040.\n\u201cAmong all of its greatness, San Francisco leads the world in seismic safety policy; always has. Earthquake science and engineering were born here, and the Bay Area community has never stopped delivering pace-setting advances. Many of the key ideas about community resilience coalesced here, and the programs that resulted are setting the standard for communities worldwide. For an earthquake engineer like me, there is no better place to practice, learn, invent, and create solutions and policies that improve the safety and well-being of the people everywhere.\u201d\n- Chris Poland, Chair, NEHRP ACEHR Co-Chair,\nSPUR Resilient Cities Initiative\nContinue to Retrofit Our Soft Story Residential Buildings\nIn 2017, the Earthquake Safety Implementation Program (ESIP) will build on its existing Mandatory Soft Story Retrofit Program by mandating that all older three-and four-unit, wood-framed, soft story residential buildings be retrofitted by 2025. Retrofitting these buildings will improve safety for as many as 180,000 San Franciscans, while continuing to protect rent-controlled and affordable housing, vulnerable San Franciscans and community-serving small businesses.\nFEATURED PROJECT\nThe Mandatory Soft Story\nRetrofit Program\nIn 2013, the Mayor and the Board of\nSupervisors unanimously approved\nlegislation requiring the retrofit\nof 5,000 of San Francisco\u2019s most\nseismically vulnerable buildings. These\nbuildings\u2014two-plus-story, wood-\nframed structures built before 1978\nthat contain five or more residential units\u2014are all \u201csoft story\u201d buildings. Soft story buildings contain large openings on the ground level, either from garage openings or from large windows for neighborhood-serving businesses. These large openings leave soft story buildings susceptible to severe damage, or even collapse, in the event of an earthquake.\nSoft story buildings, which house roughly 180,000 San Franciscans, make up a significant portion of our City\u2019s rent-controlled housing stock, and contain many beloved, neighborhood-serving businesses.\nThe Mandatory Soft Story Retrofit Program, administered between the ESIP and the Department of Building Inspection, hosted a comprehensive and culturally competent outreach program, with customer service-based technical and financial assistance. These efforts included an Earthquake Retrofit Fair, trailing legislation aimed at easing renter and landlord compliance, and a series of informational mailers. The program currently boasts a near 100 percent compliance rate.\nr\nSan Francisco took a holistic approach by working with a broad coalition of stakeholders who ultimately developed a successful program to protect our residents.\nINITIATIVE 2.2\nEvaluate and Retrofit Our\nNon-Ductile Concrete Buildings\nESIP will call for the evaluation of all non-ductile concrete buildings starting in 2020. And it will call for retrofitting these buildings by 2030. Non-ductile concrete buildings were built before modern building codes, leaving them susceptible to extreme damage or even collapse in the event of an earthquake. Many non-ductile concrete buildings have high occupancies; in a modeled repeat of the 1906 earthquake, a large proportion of the deaths and serious injuries were attributed to the collapse of non-ductile concrete buildings. The Concrete Coalition at the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute estimates there are 3,200 of these buildings in San Francisco. ESIP is currently working with the Applied Technologies Council (ATC), as seen in Chapter 1 of this Strategy, to determine collapse prevention retrofit criteria.\nINTEGRATION\nOlder non-ductile concrete buildings were constructed using more brittle material, making them hazardous in an earthquake.\nThe cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles have been working together to address the unique needs of urban areas facing earthquake risk. The San Francisco Earthquake Safety Implementation Program consulted with LA Mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s office in the 12 months leading up to their release of Resilience By Design\u2014LA\u2019s roadmap for earthquake resilience.\nINITIATIVE 2.3\nRetrofit Our Most Hazardous\nPublicly Owned Buildings\nUnder the City Administrator, the Capital Planning Program reviews and prioritizes 10-Year Capital Plan projects and coordinates funding. The City and County of San Francisco have completed over 200 earthquake-related improvements, including total replacements of public facilities in the nearly 27 years since the Loma Prieta Earthquake struck on October 17, 1989. We must continue this work in the coming years as we prepare our City for the next major earthquake. The program upgrades range from small but critical pump stations and transmission mains to large-scale, essential facilities like police and fire stations, and the 911 Emergency Operations Center. The 10-year Capital Plan also prioritizes retrofits for signature properties, such as the San Francisco General Hospital Level 1 Trauma Center Hospital, Public Safety Building, City Hall; the Ferry Building; the Main Library; the Veteran\u2019s War Memorial and Opera buildings, Academy of Sciences, Asian Art and DeYoung Museums; and the International Terminal, Terminal 2 and the Main Control Tower at SFO.\nr\nOriginally completed in 1932, the War Memorial Veterans Building was where President Harry S. Truman and other heads of state signed the United Nations Charter in 1945. Through OneSF, this historic resource underwent a seismic retrofit, systems were upgraded to be more energy-efficient, and safety features like sprinkler and fire alarm systems were added.\nSan Francisco General Hospital Level 1 Trauma Center\nSan Francisco General Hospital\u2019s Level 1 Trauma Center was constructed using a seismic base-isolated foundation, making it one of the most earthquake-resistant buildings in the nation. During an earthquake, the base isolators under the building can slide 30 inches in any direction, greatly reducing movement of the building. This technology is the best way to ensure the hospital can remain operational after a significant seismic event. Reducing 3,000 tons of steel from the structure, combined with the material and energy conserved in not having to perform extensive repairs or replace the building after an earthquake, earned the trauma center an Innovation in Design credit toward its LEED certification. It is estimated that our isolated building design represents a savings of about $10 million, compared to a fixed-base structural frame.\nThe Retrofund: Expand Financing Programs That Build Resilience\nThe City recently expanded its\nProperty Assessed Clean Energy\n(PACE) Program to create a\nnew financing initiative to help\nproperty owners make seismic and environmentally conscious building improvements. One property at a time, this program will make our city a greener and safer community. Program benefits include:\n\u25a0\t100 percent financing of hard and soft costs\n\u25a0\tFinancing for seismic retrofits and seismic strengthening\n\u25a0\tEnergy-efficiency, water conservation and renewable energy projects may be financed\n\u25a0\tExpansions of the program are being made to include disabled access improvements for commercial storefronts\n\u25a0\tCompetitive fixed rates and repayment terms of up to 30 years\n\u25a0\tApproval based on the property\u2019s equity, not the applicant\u2019s credit score\n\u25a0\tFinancing is tied to the property and can be transferred to a new owner upon sale\n\u25a0\tProperty owner keeps any applicable federal\/state rebates and\/or tax credits\n\u25a0\tPayments are made through the property\u2019s tax bill as a special assessment\nAfter an extensive selection process, the City partnered with\nAllianceNRG to provide fixed rate loans. Borrowers are required to comply with the Mandatory Soft Story Retrofit program.\nINITIATIVE 2.5\nStrengthen Our Emergency\nFacilities and Shorten Response Times\nIn June 2014, San Francisco voters approved the $400 million Earthquake Safety and Emergency Response Bond (ESER 2014)\nto continue to pay for repairs and improvements that will allow San Francisco to quickly respond to a major earthquake or disaster. The first phase of the program, ESER 2010, was approved by voters in June 2010. In the years to come, the City will continue to make improvements to neighborhood firehouses and upgrade our emergency firefighting water system. The Public Safety Building, with funding from ESER 2010, opened in April 2015. This bond, and the work of our City\u2019s Capital Planning effort, OneSF, is aimed at improving service both for today and in the years ahead.\nBuilt to modern seismic standards, the new Public Safety Building was designed to operate for up to 96 hours off the grid, allowing leadership to promptly and efficiently respond after a disaster.\nRepair, Upgrade\nand Protect\nOur Sewer Systems\nWater System\nImprovement\nProgram\nINITIATIVE 2.8\nINTEGRATION\no\nThe San Francisco Public Utilities\nCommission's (SFPUC) Sewer System\nImprovement Project (SSIP) is a 20-year,\nmultibillion-dollar Citywide investment in\nupgrading our aging sewer infrastructure. Costly emergency and routine repairs are not sufficient to keep pace with our 100-year-old, seismically vulnerable\nsystem, and the longer upgrades are\ndelayed, the more expensive they\nbecome. For example, we should update\nour sewer system to withstand intense\nrainstorms, which occur with greater\nfrequency as a result of climate change.\nSewer system upgrades like this are\nessential to the overall vitality of our City's public health, the environment and our ability to recovery after a disaster.\nWith the completion of the Sutro\nReservoir Retrofit Program in 2015,\nSan Francisco finalized its $4.8 billion\nWater System Improvement Program\n(WSIP). WSIP was a multi-year capital\nprogram to upgrade the San Francisco\nPublic Utilities Commission's regional\nand local water systems, enhancing\nthe agency's ability to provide reliable,\naffordable, high-quality drinking water in an environmentally sustainable manner to 2.6 million people in the Bay Area.\nThe program, which has increased\nsafety and daily service, consisted of\n83 projects\u201435 local projects within\nSan Francisco and 48 regional projects\nspread over seven counties.\nRepair, Expand and Improve\nAuxiliary and Portable Water\nSupply Systems\nThe Auxiliary Water Supply System, an independent\nhigh-pressure system dedicated to fire protection, will be\nimproved and expanded. Built seven years after the earthquake and fire of 1906, this one-of-a-kind system has the ability to deliver water at much higher pressures and use unlimited water from the Bay. The auxiliary system is our last line of defense in a fire after an earthquake. The system is also used by the San Francisco Fire Department to increase service capacity in response m, providing critical firefighting water to areas in need\nThe Lifelines Council\nNew underground\ninfrastructure is being\ninstalled by SFPUC to\nsupport portable hose\nconnections. Rather than\nblock city streets with\nthe large hoses needed\nto provide protection\nagainst the conflagration\nof post-earthquake\nfires, the infrastructure\nwill allow water to flow\nunderground. This work is informed by the Lifelines Council initiative aimed at improving the resilience of our priority access routes.\nEarthquake Vulnerability\nStudy of the Northern Waterfront\nSeawall\nAs part of the Port of San Francisco\u2019s effort to improve waterfront resiliency, we will undertake an Earthquake Vulnerability Study of the Northern Waterfront Seawall. The study is a component of the Port\u2019s effort to improve resiliency of the waterfront. The Northern Waterfront Seawall, or Great Seawall, stabilizes over three miles of historic waterfront and hundreds of acres of filled land stretching from Fisherman\u2019s Wharf to Mission Creek. This area includes significant Port and City assets, such as the Historic Piers, Ferry Building, Embarcadero Promenade and roadway, Ferry & Cruise Terminals, BART Transbay Tube, MUNI light rail and utility infrastructure. The high-level study, which is nearly complete, will assess earthquake vulnerability, predict damage and economic impacts from a range of earthquake events, develop conceptual mitigation alternatives, and make recommendations for further action and study. This information will inform the Port\u2019s Strategic Plan, as well as its efforts to improve lifeline resiliency, and respond to climate change and sea level rise.\no\nThe Port of San Francisco, The Earthquake Safety Implementation Program and the Sea Level Rise Coordinating Committee, through the Public Works and Planning Departments, are working in concert to build a truly resilient waterfront, weighing all variables, including the impacts of earthquakes, liquefaction and sea level rise.\n0\n0 50 100 Roots Program\nSan Francisco\u2019s formula for reaching our greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals by 2025 is \u201c0, 50 and 100\u201d: zero waste, 50 percent sustainable trips and 100 percent renewable energy. The San Francisco Department of the Environment, the Mayor\u2019s Office, the Board of Supervisors and City departments are working together to reach these vital goals.\n0 50 100 Roots Across City Departments\nStrategic partnerships are the foundation of the 0 50 100 Roots initiative. The SFPUC\u2019s CleanPowerSF program, San Francisco Environment\u2019s mandatory composting and recycling program, the San Francisco MTA\u2019s MUNI Forward program and a number of other efforts across departments help us reach these goals every day.\nAnd San Francisco\u2019s approach to mitigating carbon emissions will continue to be a collaborative one.\nActively Plan\nfor Climate Change at Every City Department\nIf you don\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t mitigate it. That\u2019s why San Francisco requires every City department to track and report greenhouse gas emissions in annual Departmental Climate Action Plans. Departments look at vehicle fuel and building energy usage, water usage and employee practices related to waste, transportation and purchasing. This process helps departments identify how to improve operations, reduce their carbon footprints and address climate change.\nThe San Francisco Environment engages City departments in the climate action planning process by providing data and best practices on environmental policies to departmental climate liaisons. These climate liaisons then conduct outreach and education to spearhead organizational change.\nFund Innovative Emission Reduction\nThrough the San Francisco Carbon Fund, the City offsets municipal travel-related greenhouse gas emissions by investing in projects that reduce emissions within the City and County of San Francisco. Conferences and conventions in San Francisco may also contribute to the fund to offset event-related emissions. For example, the City currently invests approximately 13 percent of employee airfare related to City business in greenhouse gas-reducing projects, such as the creation of new urban parks and community gardens, the planting of trees and drought-resistant vegetation, and the restoration of native habitats and corridors. The Fund has already made a huge difference across our city, financing projects that have improved neighborhood walkability, created new community gathering spaces, reduced stormwater runoff and erosion, and sequestered carbon.\nThree-dimensional view of downtown with 108-inch inundation, which shows sea level rise expected by 2100, combined with a 100-year storm.\nDevelop a Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan\nEarly this year, the City released its Sea Level Rise (SLR) Action Plan. Building on significant and collaborative prior work, it defines an overarching vision, while putting forth key objectives for SLR planning in San Francisco. It summarizes current climate science,\nreviews relevant policies and regulations, and estimates the cost of inaction. It also identifies data gaps and establishes an aggressive framework for further assessment, adaptation planning and implementation. Among other key steps, the Action Plan calls for the Planning Department to develop a comprehensive Citywide adaptation plan by summer 2018.\nO\nThis action plan was accelerated in partnership with Risk Management Solutions (RMS) and funding support from 100 Resilient Cities, a 100RC Platform Partner. RMS provided sea level rise modeling expertise, and helped the City complete an exposure analysis of both public and private assets in the City and County of San Francisco.\nThe Bay Area Resilient by Design Challenge was spearheaded by the City and County of San Francisco, in collaboration with many Bay Area local governments, regional agencies, research institutions, and nongovernment organizations. Managing partners include: Bay Conservation and Development Commission, Association of Bay Area Governments, Coastal Conservancy, Bay Area Regional Collaborative,\nSPUR, San Francisco,\nEstuary Institute, City of San Francisco Planning Dept. and Chief Resilience Officers of Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco, and the City of San Jose.\nDesign Challenge\nLaunch Regional Waterfront\nThe Bay Area Resilient by Design Challenge is a\npublic-private partnership that seeks to pool the talents of the best minds of our region -- experts in ecology, technology, design and social activism -- to\nprotect and enhance the most vulnerable communities along the Bay\u2019s natural built shoreline. Selected teams will conduct intensive research of existing conditions, challenges and opportunities, and will then work with local government, nonprofit and private sector leaders, and community stakeholders to develop design solutions that will help communities adapt to and prepare for the impacts of climate change, such as flooding and drought. This effort will launch on April 18, 2016, in conjunction with the release of this strategy.\nPromote Community\nHealth Through Preparing for Climate Change\nChanges occurring in San Francisco\u2019s climate are affecting our health and will have even greater impacts in the future. The San Francisco Department of Public Health\u2019s (SFDPH) Climate and Health Program is helping to understand these impacts and prepare the health department and communities for the health risks. The Climate and Health team uses cross-sector collaboration to assess climate trends, define disease burden, develop interventions and evaluate the effects of climate change. The program has developed plans to address climate change related changes in extreme weather (heat, storms and flooding) and has also created a Climate and Health Profile for the City with a Community Resiliency Indicator System. SFDPH is currently drafting a Climate and Health Adaptation Plan and a five year strategy on activities to implement this Plan, including monitoring and evaluation of adaptations to reduce the negative health impacts of climate change within the jurisdiction of the health department.\nO\nStronger Housing, Safer Communities\nIn 2015, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) completed a comprehensive, Bay Area-wide study of both the structural and social components of vulnerability to flooding, ground shaking, and liquefaction. The study also outlines strategies to address specific vulnerabilities, aimed at providing an action plan for the Bay Area\u2019s 101 jurisdictions. The analysis was conducted with a focus on housing, and considered the many other factors in addition to housing integrity that influence a resident\u2019s ability to stay in a home, including impacts to infrastructure and availability of utilities, availability of jobs, and access to resources that fulfill daily needs, such as grocery stores and medical facilities.\nSupport Urban Watershed\nPlanning\nThe Urban Watershed Assessment (UWA) looks at our City\u2019s eight urban watersheds through the evaluation-based lens used by the SFPUC to plan the City\u2019s Sewer System Improvement Program (SSIP), the City\u2019s 20-year, multi bi 11 ion-dol lar effort to improve the collections portion of our combined sewer system. Weighing the unique characteristics of each of the City\u2019s eight urban watersheds, such as soil type, underlying geology, age of infrastructure and urban development patterns, the watershed assessment promotes progressive solutions. UWA recommendations will include a blend of innovative green (rain gardens, permeable pavement, bioswales) and traditional grey (tunnels, pump stations, upstream conveyance pipes) infrastructure projects, incentive programs and policies to meet our sewer system challenges. The recommendations will shape the next generation of sewer improvements to provide a compliant, reliable, resilient and flexible system that can respond to catastrophic events, manage stormwater and flooding, adapt to climate change, and provide community benefits and environmental sustainability.\nI love San Francisco because it embraces sustainability, creativity and people from all over the world\u2014and all walks of life. It has always been the home to those dreaming of a better world, and inventing the path to get there. Its whimsical topography, fresh salty air and water all around are a joy to experience on foot, bike or surfboard. And our tolerant, diverse, curious and environmentally minded community makes it a great place to raise kids!\u201d\nLaura Tam\nSustainable Development Policy Director, SPUR\nGOAL 3\nENSURE\nhousingfor^H\nSAN FRANCISCANS TODAY AND AFTER A DISASTER\nACTIONS:\nTo meet this goal, we will:\n1.\tBuild a Strong Housing Recovery Starting Today\n2.\tEnhance Systems to Rapidly House San Franciscans\n3.\tStrengthen Housing Now to Better Prepare Us for Tomorrow\nIntroduction\nEighty-five thousand residential units could be permanently lost in an earthquake. After a disaster, we will need to scale up the existing processes we use to house our residents in need. This impact can be reduced if we position the resources we need to improve these systems today. The 1906 earthquake and fire destroyed more than 28,000 buildings and left 225,000 people homeless. Disasters complicate existing challenges in a way that can hinder long-term recovery. As we plan for SF@1M, we need to think about access to housing that is both affordable and can withstand a major disaster. That\u2019s why the City is focused on protecting housing for all San Franciscans now\u2014to help us be stronger and more prepared for the uncertainties of the future.\nKEY INDICATORS:\nTo measure progress, San Francisco will:\n\u25a0\tCreate the capacity to house 95 percent of our residents in the City after a disaster.\n\u25a0\tImprove new and existing systems to house 8,000 homeless San Franciscans by 2020.\n\u25a0\tProduce 30,000 housing units by 2020, of which 30 percent will be permanently affordable and 50 percent will be middle-income housing.\n\u25a0\tCreate capacity to house a population expected to grow to 1 million residents by 2040.\nEstablish a Post-Disaster Interim Housing Strategy\nKeep San Franciscans in San Francisco after a Disaster\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery, in partnership with the Department of Emergency Management, will expand the City\u2019s All-Hazards Response and Restoration Plan, detailing the coordination, roles and responsibilities of responding agencies, and how the City will work with state and federal partners during an emergency. After an interdepartmental community engagement process, the strategy will be released in 2018.\nIt is critical to recovery that we keep our residents in the City after a major disaster. We must therefore create a thorough and dynamic plan to provide temporary shelters, keeping residents in the City, while quickly enabling building owners to make repairs. Speedy repairs will allow residents to return to their homes as quickly as possible. We have developed a three-point strategy to ensure a quick, effective and inclusive housing recovery:\nShelter in Home\nThe best outcome for residents after a disaster is the ability to remain in their homes. Residential units will likely be damaged, so this may take the form of mobile housing units on or close to the site of the homes or living in a relatively safe, though damaged, unit. Through a Shelter First Repair Program, repairs can be made quickly with the goal of reoccupying the homes as soon as possible. Special attention should be paid to the multifamily structures that house approximately 70 percent of San Franciscans.\nShelter in Village\nIf residents remaining in their homes or on the site of their homes is not possible, the next best option is to shelter in village, where the residents live temporarily in a new location within the neighborhood. This causes minimal disruption to the residents\u2019 lives as their unit is repaired, while maintaining work, school, local amenities and neighborhood relationships\u2014facilitating a speedy recovery.\nShelter in City\nOur top priority is keeping San Franciscans in their city. If it is not possible for residents to remain in their home or their neighborhood, this strategy would keep them in the city at shelter and housing sites. This will minimize economic damage, facilitate rebuilding and help prevent one of the most destructive ills of post-disaster cities\u2014 population loss.\nCreate a Disaster Recovery Case Management Program and Database\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery, in partnership with the Department of Public Health and the Human Services Agency, will form a Disaster Recovery Case Management Program. The program will develop a comprehensive and user-friendly database to help case managers provide assistance through close cooperation with organizations currently serving vulnerable populations. This program will also maintain a Citizens Advisory Recovery Committee to establish an appropriate database platform, oversee the program, and serve as an advisory and oversight body during San Francisco\u2019s recovery. After a disaster, typically only 80 percent of those needing assistance will be able to navigate the process easily, 15 percent will require more case management and 5 percent will require detailed assistance. Because of unique challenges and issues faced by many of San Francisco\u2019s most vulnerable residents, this program, which launches in 2017, becomes all the more critical to our recovery.\nLearning from Network Cities: New Orleans\nTo help facilitate the rebuilding of the Broadmoor neighborhood in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor Development Corporation created its own database. Under the leadership of Howard Roark, interns and students built a Salesforce platform for cataloging the needs of the community\u2019s 7,000 residents. With the database, Roark could detail for\ndonors where their money was going and get them in touch with the residents they were helping. It also allowed Roark to track outstanding repairs so, for example, when a plumber stopped by, that person could be directed to jobs that needed attention.\n\u201cWe are working to empower the leadership of local nonprofits, so their organizations can continue to provide critical services after a disaster.\u201d\n\u2014Brian Whitlow and Elaine Tokolahi\nSan Francisco Community Agencies Responding to Disaster (SF CARD)\nEstablish a Citizens Advisory Recovery Committee\nSan Francisco will establish a Citizens Advisory Recovery Committee (Recover-SF) to provide a much-needed connection between the city government and vulnerable populations served by assistance programs during recovery. This committee will be composed of representatives from service provider organizations, leadership from vulnerable population communities and City representatives. San Francisco will push to establish Recover-SF in 2016, as it will be instrumental in the development of the Disaster Recovery Case Management Program and database, in the planning of interim and transitional housing for vulnerable populations, in ensuring that information flows to communities and in ensuring the City receives feedback. Establishing Recover-SF now will help ensure our equitable, complete and speedy recovery tomorrow.\nSUPPORTING INITIATIVE 3.4\nShelter-in-Place Health Impact Assessment\nIn 2015, the San Francisco Department of Public Health completed its health impact assessment of sheltering in place, examining the\nhealth impacts of remaining in one\u2019s home after a major earthquake. This assessment helps the Office of Resilience and Recovery work with its partners to establish recovery planning for the City, and to better understand the health impacts of living in a damaged unit as repairs are conducted following a disaster.\nQuickly Repair and Reoccupy Our Housing Stock After a Disaster\nIn 2017, the Office of Resilience and Recovery will launch a program modeled after New York City\u2019s Rapid Repairs Initiative under the FEMA STEP pilot program. New York\u2019s Rapid Repairs Initiative facilitated basic and temporary repairs to homes, therefore allowed residents to quickly return to their homes after Hurricane Sandy. San Francisco\u2019s ability to quickly reoccupy our housing will help the City accelerate its recovery by sourcing appropriate funding that can be reimbursed by the federal government. This can be accomplished by prenegotiating with qualified contractors and by easing or waiving habitability standards as needed.\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery, in partnership with community groups and organizations, such as the Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (VOADs), will initiate a culturally competent and multilingual outreach campaign. This communications campaign will utilize multiple channels and networks to explain programs and encourage enrollment, as well as provide program materials and enrollment assistance.\no\nInterim\/Transitional Disaster Housing Framework:\nA Harvard Kennedy School and City of San Francisco\nPartnership\nThe Interim\/Transitional Disaster Housing Framework\nis a theoretical and analytical plan created in\nconsultation with the City by students, faculty\nand fellows of the Harvard Kennedy School. The\nFramework was written to assist the Office of Resilience and Recovery, and its partners, in planning for transitional housing needs in a postdisaster setting.\nAs the team carried out its research and analysis, it was tasked with maintaining the integrity of the City\u2019s top priorities around repopulation and rebuilding after a large-scale disaster. They prioritized interim housing units\u2019 proximity to the original residence, then to the neighborhood, and then, if neither option is available, somewhere within the City. The team also focused on rethinking and defining vulnerable populations, with a particular emphasis on identifying and addressing unmet needs. Finally, the team created scalable, flexible options that allow the City and individual neighborhoods to choose the right solutions for themselves and to feel included in the process.\n\u201cIncreased mitigation and planning for our long-term recovery is critical in preserving our beautiful, vibrant and diverse city.\u201d\n\u2014Mary Comerio,\nProfessor, UC Berkeley Author, \u201cDisaster Hits Home:\nNew Policy for Urban Housing Recovery\u201d\nLeverage Navigation Centers\nfor Post-Disaster Triage\nDuring a long-term recovery from a major disaster, systems we use today to help place homeless residents into more permanent housing can scale up to serve a spontaneous population that may find itself without a home. Working with the San Francisco Interfaith Council, Mayor Lee opened the first Navigation Center in March 2015, supported by a $3 million donation from the San Francisco Interfaith Council.\nThe Navigation Center provides homeless San Franciscans with room, board and support services, including help securing stable employment, public benefits and permanent housing. The pilot location at 1950 Mission Street features a common courtyard, storage for belongings, meals, showers and laundry, and dormitory accommodations for 75 clients and their pets. These centers will target difficult-to-serve homeless residents, often with psychological barriers to using traditional shelters, and has helped nearly 400 San Franciscans find alternatives to living on the street.\nr\nPublic Works made renovations to the Navigation Center site prior to its opening.\nRapidly Rehouse Homeless San Franciscans Today and After a Disaster\nThe Department to End Homelessness (not yet formally named) will continue to use the Rapid Rehousing (RRH) subsidy program to provide short-term rental subsidy and support services to house homeless San Francisco families. This includes an enhanced \u201cneed-based\u201d RRH subsidy for families who have a verified need to remain in the City and are considered among the hardest to rehouse. These populations include families with incomes less than 30 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), victims of domestic violence and children with special needs and other complex cases that require additional care. RRH has proven to be successful, with 90 to 95 percent of the families remaining stably housed after the subsidy concludes. Innovative systems like this can be scaled up after a disaster to help house San Franciscans.\nPromote Neighborhood Affordability\nThe Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing will continue to scale up the Affordable Housing Preservation & Neighborhood Stabilization Program. This program allows for more buildings to be rehabilitated and permanently stabilized as deed-restricted to households earning up to 120 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), to include very low-, low- and more middle-income San Franciscans. This program also includes active encouragement of new development to preserve buildings housing tenants at risk of displacement through the City\u2019s Inclusionary Housing Program, which currently requires developers to contribute to new affordable housing alongside their market-rate development.\nFund the Construction of\nAffordable Housing\nThe City will launch a Housing Affordability Fund to leverage limited public dollars for housing, bringing financial, employer and other sources of capital to support efficient and timely site acquisition for affordable-housing construction, or the preservation of exiting at-risk affordable rental buildings. Given the steady decline in federal and state funding for affordable housing, the loss of redevelopment agencies and the increasing cost of producing affordable housing in San Francisco, it is clear that our existing funding streams are still not enough. This fund builds on the work of the Housing Trust Fund, the most aggressive local funding stream for affordable housing in California.\nExpand Access to Affordable Housing\nThe City will allow developers to \u201cdial up\u201d their current inclusionary requirements by providing a greater percentage or number of below-market-rate units at a higher AMI target, with ownership units priced up to 120 percent of AMI and rental units priced up to 90 percent. This allows for more middle-income residents\u2014such as teachers, police officers and firefighters\u2014 to access affordable housing. This diverse approach may also carry with it the benefit of maximizing the number of affordable units on the site.\nMake New\nDevelopments\nMore Affordable\nThe City will continue to develop an Affordable Housing Bonus Program, paving the way for construction of more affordable-housing units in San Francisco neighborhoods. In close coordination with members of the community, projects considered under this program will not demolish any existing residential units, will consider open space and other community amenities, and will receive a high level of review and authorization. This program provides incentives for developers to include more affordable housing for very low-, low-, moderate-and middle-income households, building diverse affordability into our neighborhoods and strengthening our housing stock.\nRevive San Francisco\u2019s\nPublic Housing\nThe HOPE SF Initiative seeks to transform four of San Francisco\u2019s most distressed public housing sites into vibrant, thriving communities through holistic revitalization. In 2006, the City convened a taskforce, representing diverse perspectives, to develop a set of principles that would\nbecome the HOPE SF Initiative. This initiative has eight guiding visions, helping ensure a positive outcome for all residents:\n\u25a0\tEnsure No Loss of Public Housing\n\u25a0\tCreate an Economically Integrated Community\n\u25a0\tMaximize the Creation of New Affordable Housing\n\u25a0\tInvolve Residents in the Highest Levels of Participation in the Entire Project\n\u25a0\tProvide Economic Opportunities through the Rebuilding Process\n\u25a0\tIntegrate Process with Neighborhood Improvement Revitalization Plans\n\u25a0\tCreate Environmentally Sustainable and Accessible Communities\n\u25a0\tBuild a Strong Sense of Community\n\u201cSan Francisco is a vibrant community with a pioneering spirit. We live in that wonderful tension of innovation and inclusivity.\nI\u2019m proud to call our City my home!\u201d\n\u2014Michael Pappas SF Interfaith Council\nContinue the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program\nThe Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, supported by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, seeks to preserve public housing by providing local housing authorities with access to a more stable funding source, so they can make needed repairs to their properties. The RAD program will allow San Francisco\u2019s Housing\nAuthority to access, for the first time, resources such as debt financing and low-income housing tax credits. These resources will help the housing authority complete its significant rehabilitation program and preserve the long-term viability of units. In addition to improvements, all buildings will have tenant engagement services and access to neighborhood resources. The plan will also provide for rigorous tenant protections and a right of return for residents who may need to move temporarily while their units are rehabilitated.\nThe U.S. Congress\u2014which funds public housing\u2014has not provided local housing agencies with enough money for capital repairs. In San Francisco, public housing has more than $270 million in deferred capital repairs. This initiative green-lights over $500 million of repairs over the next three years for more than 4,500 distressed San Francisco Housing Authority units. Thirty-five hundred of the apartments will be rehabilitated as a portfolio, and converted to new ownership and property management by community-based, nonprofit affordable-housing developers. The City is providing over $50 million toward the effort, which is in addition to the City funds dedicated to the HOPE SF work. On its own, it would take the San Francisco Housing Authority over 50 years to provide the kind of capital improvements that will now occur within three years.\nGOAL 4\nEMPOWER\nNEIGHBORHOODS\nTHROUGH\nIMPROVED^^\u00ae\nCONNECTIONS\u00ae\nACTIONS:\nTo meet this goal, we will:\n1. Build Strong, Healthy and Connected Neighborhoods\n3. Improve Access to San Francisco Government\n3. Establish the Office of Resilience and Recovery\nIntroduction\nSan Francisco is a city of neighborhoods\u2014each with its own distinct character, culture and challenges. This is key to the City\u2019s identity and strength; protecting and empowering our neighborhoods is key to ensuring the City\u2019s resilience. San Francisco will empower neighborhoods by connecting them to new resources, improving their access to and trust in City services, and creating meaningful connections with each other.\nActions in this chapter harness what it means for residents and businesses to better connect to their City government and to each other. We need to replace inefficient systems with innovative solutions that empower San Franciscans. Better connectivity between the community and San Francisco government will allow us to strengthen existing bonds and forge new ones. These trusted relationships are essential to building strong neighborhoods. The Office of Resilience and Recovery will lead a Citywide effort to help strengthen our neighborhoods, prepare them for future disruptions, and enable them to connect better to each other and the services they need today.\nKEY INDICATORS:\nTo measure progress, San Francisco will:\n\u25a0\tEstablish the Office of Resilience and Recovery under the City Administrator.\n\u25a0\tImplement a modern user interface for all government services, with the goal of 90 percent of permitting done online by 2025.\n\u25a0\tLaunch community-level asset mapping in 29 San Francisco neighborhoods within 12 months.\n\u25a0\tReach 40,000 San Franciscans through a coordinated outreach process within 12 months.\nINITIATIVE 4.1\nReimagine Public Libraries as Community Spaces\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery will partner with the San Francisco Public Libraries (SFPL) to conduct community outreach meetings at the City\u2019s 29 libraries, building on the work already being done in the libraries to reimagine these neighborhood spaces as gathering sites. In 2014, with the completion of the North Beach branch rebuild project, the SFPL, in partnership with Friends of the San Francisco Public Library, completed its Branch Library Improvement Program, a multiyear, voter-approved upgrade of all library branches. Improvements included increased Internet connectivity, added community spaces and seismic retrofitting. The libraries moved from being places to sit in silence to places to gather, to learn and to grow as a neighborhood. ORR will work with the SFPL to continue developing this pilot program to build empowered and more connected communities.\nEnhance Trust in Our Public Safety Officials\nTrust in public safety officials is essential during times of stress and uncertainty.\nWhen disaster strikes, effective response and recovery requires a strong trust and bond\nwith our City\u2019s first responders. Police officers, fire fighters and EMS, building inspectors, health inspectors and others will be on the front lines of San Francisco\u2019s response. This approach encompasses actions aimed at helping the departments cope with the needs of a growing and changing City that is approaching SF@1M.\nForge Partnerships to Empower Neighborhoods\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery will work closely with the Invest in Neighborhoods program, run by the Office of Economic and Workforce Development, to identify and build partnerships that advance the goals of this strategy. Invest in Neighborhoods works to strengthen and revitalize neighborhood commercial districts around the City by marshaling and deploying resources from City departments and nonprofit partners. This includes services such as loan programs, fapade improvement grants and technical assistance for small businesses, leveraging City services to help small businesses thrive, increase neighborhood quality of life, improve overall physical conditions and, in turn, build community capacity.\nEvery neighborhood commercial district has its own unique needs, opportunities and challenges. Invest in Neighborhoods aims to deploy the specific services and resources that are most needed in each district, building stronger neighborhoods through strategic investment in each community\u2019s core commercial corridor. By helping the City think holistically about a neighborhood\u2019s needs, Invest in Neighborhoods makes important connections to support strong and resilient neighborhood corridors.\nHealthy Communities, Healthy Businesses\nHealthy Retail SF is a long-standing partnership that advances both public health and neighborhood core development. Healthy Retail SF promotes and makes available the consumption of healthy, fresh and affordable food by encouraging small corner stores to become healthy food retailers. The program provides concentrated and tailored technical assistance to business owners to increase healthy food options, which helps not only their business but the entire community.\nPromote Neighborhood Environmental Health Education\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery, through its community engagement process, will help the Department of Public Health advance disaster recovery and climate change-related health education in our neighborhoods. Education increases our community\u2019s overall health and connectedness. It helps build awareness that will lead to the community\u2019s ability to respond to climate change, including extreme heat, extreme cold, flooding from storms and air quality challenges. This work seeks to reach vulnerable populations and the organizations that serve those populations.\nBuild Capacity in Community-Based Health Organizations\nTo improve the post-disaster response capacity of neighborhoodserving community-based health organizations (CBOs), the Department of Public Health conducts training and provides technical assistance on continuity of operations planning for contracted San Francisco CBOs. The Office of Resilience and Recovery will work to support this activity during its 2016-17 community engagement process.\nEmpower Neighborhoods through Increased Capacity\nThe City will continue to partner with neighborhood and community leaders to empower individuals and their communities to build stronger, more connected and more resilient neighborhoods. The Neighborhood Empowerment Network (NEN) is a City partnership program with a coalition of residents, neighborhood organizations, nonprofits and faith-based institutions. Its mission is to empower residents through partnership and outreach, leveraging community assets to strengthen residents and their neighborhoods. NEN gives voice to communities and increases their capacity through events, resources and its annual NEN Awards, which honor valued community leaders.\nBayview Neighborhood\nSupport Center\nIn times of crisis, communities lean on trusted institutions, service providers and faith-based organizations in their neighborhood or community. Community trust is critical, as those in need may not be as willing to engage with an outside institution that is unfamiliar with the community. Building empowered and resilient neighborhoods means leveraging existing community support channels, rather than creating competing or redundant organizations.\nEstablished in 2006 with a grant from the San Francisco Foundation, Providence Baptist Church and Foundation is an example of this kind of neighborhood-embedded organization. The Church partners with the San Francisco Community Agencies Responding to Disasters (SF CARD) to train staff and prepare the Church to become an anchor in its community for those in need. The Providence Foundation leveraged this training to build on the services offered at its 125-bed shelter to help homeless men in the community. This effort has expanded into additional facilities, such as a family shelter, a women\u2019s shelter and a storage facility to keep belongings secure. Now the shelter guests can go to job interviews or get the services they need without worrying about the safety of their belongings. As an institution partnering with the City, the Bayview Neighborhood Support Center is also in a position to help provide support to neighborhood residents after a disaster.\n\u201cWe are working to build a culture of preparedness in our neighborhood to help support us through good times and bad.\u201d\n\u2014GL Hodge\nProvidence Baptist Church\nLearning from Bayview:\nCommunity Asset Mapping\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery, in partnership with Appallicious, will make a comprehensive data visualization platform tailored to daily and situational resilience.\nCalled the Community Resilience Platform, it will be available in all San Francisco neighborhoods. In 2014, a cohort of concerned Bayview residents worked closely with City staff and Appallicious to develop San Francisco\u2019s first daily-use Digital Community Resilience Platform. Through an extensive research and discovery process, the neighborhood identified its assets, vulnerabilities and critical stakeholders. The residents continue to use this tool to build a stronger community one day at a time, one task at a time, one crisis at a time. ORR and Appallicious will pilot a new community-level dashboard in 29 neighborhoods as part of ORR\u2019s strategic outreach partnership with the San Francisco Public Libraries.\n\u201cOur vibrant neighborhoods, committed community organizations and resilient spirit are what make this a unique and amazing place.\u201d\n- Andrea Zusmaan\nThe San Francisco Foundation\nDevelop a Public Digital Service Strategy\nThe Digital Service Strategy is a commitment to create a better service experience for residents, visitors and businesses. Through strategic redesign, the City can build digital services that are accessible and easy to use. The City should build products that improve the consumer experience by emphasizing iterative design principles and user feedback. Key to realizing this shared vision will be assembling a digital services team of modern web technology experts and developing a culture that seeks to constantly improve services. In the coming years, the City will strategically transform service delivery by changing the ways we build and manage digital products. The City hopes to redefine its relationship with residents and visitors by becoming more responsive, and by providing accessible, easy-to-use services.\nr\nSan Francisco is improving the ways in which our residents connect to he services they need.\nReceive and Issue Permits\nElectronically\nTo use public resources efficiently, to get housing built faster and to ready San Francisco for a quick and effective recovery, the City will put together an electronic permitting plan by 2018 and implement the program by 2020. Outdated permit processes result in inefficient and lengthy wait times, coupled with redundant review procedures, often confusing the applicant as to which step is next in the process. Residents and businesses need to have a clear picture of what is required from start to finish in any permit process. San Francisco has always been a hub of innovation. There is a powerful opportunity to embrace technology, and to provide transparency and efficiency with the implementation of an online electronic permitting system.\nCity processes are becoming more digitally streamlined, allowing for better service now and a speedy recovery after a major disaster, because the systems can be supported from remote locations. After a disaster, in light of our interim housing goals of retaining 95 percent of our population and housing those residents largely in their homes or neighborhoods, we will need a fast, flexible and effective permitting system that meets user needs. This system provides benefits now and builds a stronger tomorrow.\nBusiness Portal: Build Capacity through Efficiency\nThe day-to-day success of our City, as well as its recovery after a disaster, depends on the success of small businesses. Streamlining outdated and duplicative systems, the San Francisco Business Portal consolidates information on more than 400 permits and licenses available to small businesses. Some examples of forms that are accessible in the Business Portal include the Business Registration form from the Treasurer and Tax Collector required of every business, the Permit to Operate from the Department of Public Health for all restaurants, and the Dog Walking permit from Animal Care and Control for any dog walker with four or more dogs. Small businesses in San Francisco face challenges that, in the event of an unexpected disruption, make them vulnerable. By easing the uncertainty in the process of starting a new business, the City can help build a more resilient economy. This Portal serves as an in-operation model for the work that is to come. A joint project of the Department of Technology, Office of Economic and Workforce Development and Office of Small Business, in partnership with the design firm Tomorrow Partners, the San Francisco Business Portal advances Mayor Lee\u2019s goal of using technology to make government more responsive and effective to the needs of residents and entrepreneurs.\nMonitor Progress on Realizing Resilience Goals\nOne of ORR\u2019s two primary tasks will be facilitating an ongoing conversation around our resilience goals, aimed at ensuring that all departments have the tools they need to help the City meet these goals. Within the first six months, this office will develop a tracking methodology to ensure that this process is effective, efficient and transparent, providing accountability to all departments and divisions that play a role in meeting these goals. This tracking methodology will help us measure progress in a tangible and easily accessible manner. The primary focus of this effort will be collaboration, focusing our City partners around an integrated approach to achieve our goals and develop new ones. ORR will update the strategy annually in order to measure the progress the City is making toward its bold goals.\nThese processes will form an even stronger strategy, working with the community and our partners within government to advance and build a strong culture of resilience in San Francisco.\nLaunch a Collaborative\nCommunity Process\nThe ORR\u2019s other principal task is an extensive community process. Rather than bring the strategy to the community as an end product, our approach will be to engage in a yearlong dialogue with San Francisco\u2019s neighborhoods. During the strategy\u2019s formation, dozens of conversations were held with community groups and neighborhood leaders; we will continue to build on that dialogue, aimed at achieving a community action strategy as part of the broader resilience strategy.\nIn many ways, this process has already begun. Our community engagement efforts arise from continuing partnerships with City departments, programs and efforts underway in the community, building on long-standing conversations and seeking to advance our City\u2019s current and new resilience goals.\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery will work with the following partners to conduct community meetings at San Francisco\u2019s 29 public library branches beginning in 2016 and wrapping up in 2017.\n\u25a0\tOffice of the City Administrator\n\u25a0\tThe Port of San Francisco\n\u25a0\tSan Francisco Public Library\n\u25a0\tSan Francisco Fire Department NERT\n\u25a0\tDepartment of Emergency Management\n\u25a0\tPlanning Department\n\u25a0\tDepartment of Public Health\n\u25a0\tSan Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency\n\u25a0\tSan Francisco\nPublic Utilities Commission\n\u25a0\tSan Francisco Public Works\n\u25a0\tOffice of Civic Engagement\n\u25a0\tHuman Services Agency\n\u25a0\tDepartment\nof Building Inspection\nBuild Partnerships to Advance Resilience\nMany partner organizations assisted with the creation of this resilience strategy, including Risk Management Solutions (RMS), a 100 Resilient Cities Platform Partner. Based in the Bay Area, RMS completed an economic impact assessment of sea level rise. City government cannot do this alone. We need the ability to tap into the expertise of the private sector, while still acting in the best interests of and on behalf of the communities we serve. We will build on this collaboration with RMS by securing strategic partnerships that allow us to empower our communities and advance resilience.\nNeighborland is a communications platform that empowers city agencies to collaborate with neighborhood residents to identify real-world problems and find solutions. Their technology will help build an inclusive, accessible, integrated and participatory tool for communication and coordination between San Francisco government departments and residents. Leveraging their experience working with civic organizations throughout the U.S., including city agencies, universities, foundations and local nonprofits, Neighborland\u2019s participatory planning design tools will help us reach as many residents as possible.\nThis tool will go live and begin use in San Francisco neighborhoods in mid- to late 2016 as part of our collaborative community process.\nAppallicious is an open data visualization company that helps government better\nserve its citizens. Its data visualization and analysis products will allow neighborhoods to identify assets, resources and vulnerabilities so that government agencies, businesses and community-based organizations can collaborate on identifying opportunities, building capacity and addressing weaknesses to create more empowered neighborhoods. This tool will go live beginning in mid- to late 2016 as part of our collaborative community process.\nRMS is a risk-modeling company with the mission to create a more resilient and sustainable global\nsociety through a better understanding of catastrophic events. A partner with San Francisco for more than a decade, RMS provided modeling expertise regarding San Francisco\u2019s exposure to sea level rise for both public and private assets as part of the strategy development process in conjunction with 100 Resilient Cities.\nRegional and Statewide Partnerships\nAchieving resilience in San Francisco will require state and regional action.\nThe Office of Resilience and Recovery will work with the resilience offices in our neighboring cities of Oakland and Berkeley, our regional partners in ABAG and our statewide partners\u2019 resilience office in Los Angeles to strengthen existing relationships and form new ones. San Francisco is not alone in forming a resilience strategy\u2014three other California cities, Los Angeles, Oakland and Berkeley, have resilience programs. In addition, the Association of Bay Area Governments, our region\u2019s planning agency, has a resilience program. A critical piece of this work will be building on those relationships to create a more resilient San Francisco, a more resilient Bay Area and a more resilient California.","ENTITIES":{"DATE":["next 29

The city has recovered from catastrophic floods and economic crises that have left painful wounds.\nAfter two disasters at the dawn of the 21st century (the overflow of the Salado River in 2003, and the heavy rains that led to significant flooding U12007), the city adopted disaster risk reduction as a core policy to be included in its development plan. At present, the city counts on contingency plans and early warning systems; it has also made progress in the field of flood risk mitigation; it has valued its ecosystem and redefined urban development rules. Santa Fe has built further capacity and preparedness and has recovered faster from climate events, more frequent in the last years.\nWe have learned to embrace living with our rivers and we have come up with better solutions to water-related shocks. We know that saving lives is fundamental, but we want to take a step forward and move toward resilience.\nCities throughout the world are facing increasingly complex challenges - social exclusion, climate change, organized crime, new economies, technological development, and conurbation. These challenges call for the adoption of new paradigms and approaches to city governance and urban management, in line with the international guidelines set forth in the Sustainable Development Goals, the Sendai Framework, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda.\nWe believe in adopting resilience as our core approach for tackling these challenges, as resilience not only focuses on building the community\u2019s capacity to emerge stronger from crises and acute shocks but also on managing chronic stresses. How can the city grow without causing environmental risk? How can we foster community integration, especially including children, young people, women and the elderly? These are some of the questions that guide our work. Because while we know that acute shocks and chronic stresses affect us all, the poor and the helpless are always among the hardest hit.\nTo make progress along the path of resilience, we have counted on the invaluable support of the 100 Resilient Cities\u2019 Network, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, since December 2014. So far, we have created a Resilience Office, and we have developed a strategy with\nspecific targets and projects designed in close collaboration with different city stakeholders and international experts.\nThis document is a summary of the measures taken throughout a year-long process, and of the medium and long-term measures yet to be taken with a vision of building an integrated and thriving city, a safer community with a strong spirit of solidarity, solid and convergent systems, a sustainable economy with opportunities for young people, and a city with a metropolitan approach to development.\nWe are convinced that this is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for Santa Fe. Our efforts have been awarded international recognition, and now the city is sharing its experience in different forums and city networks. Now, we count on a Resilience Strategy to shed light on the work to be carried out in the years to come.\nThere is a new political wind blowing through Argentina, which prioritizes dialogue and collaboration among the different levels of the State, which acknowledges the existence of big problems and is strongly determined to solve them, and which builds on values such as education and hard work to build a more equitable and fair country. This is a good starting point. Cities are privileged settings where people\u2019s lives develop. Cities can promote well-being or grief, depending on the future we envision and the way we manage it.\nThe City Government is fully committed to working hand in hand with the community to integrate resilience-driven thinking, social inclusion and sustainable development into public policies, thus turning Santa Fe into a land of opportunity.\nJOSE MANUEL CORRAL\nMayor of the city of Santa Fe\n\u201cThe City Government is fully committed to working together with the community to integrate resilience-driven thinking, social inclusion and sustainable development into public policies, thus turning Santa Fe into a land of opportunity.\u201d\nAn\nexemplary vision of resilience\nOn behalf of the entire ioo Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate Mayor Corral and the city of Santa Fe on the release of Santa Fe Resiliente, a major milestone for the city and for our partnership. Santa Fe Resiliente lays out an exemplary vision of urban resilience for the city and the region. A dynamic city with a rich history, Santa Fe builds on its past as it lays the foundations for a resilient future.\nThe birthplace of Argentina\u2019s constitution, Santa Fe is a modern metropolis that serves as an education and science hub as well as a center for the one of the country\u2019s richest agricultural regions. Building on groundbreaking work the city has already done, this Strategy sets out a clear vision to develop further resilience to Santa Fe\u2019s myriad 21st century challenges.\nA city surrounded and by water, Santa Fe has long had to contend with rivers and lakes that regularly challenge the security of its urban fabric. Catastrophic floods, including in 2003 and 2007, both of which inundated more than a third of the city and caused the evacuation of over 130,000 people, led to major political change and pioneering work in in disaster risk reduction.\nHowever, the city is committed to developing more meaningful urban resilience that strengthens the entire urban ecosystem, and enriches the lives of all of Santa Fe\u2019s residents, especially its most vulnerable. Through the commitment and leadership of Chief Resilience Officer Andrea Valsagna and her team, the city has designed an ambitious Strategy that addresses far more than the shocks it has endured from flooding. The Strategy provides initiatives and actions that tackle stresses such as endemic crime, social exclusion, deep economic divisions, and other hardships experienced regularly by those living in informal settlements in the flood plains. It also embraces its wetlands and rivers as assets rather than only challenges, and provides plans for major parks and natural reserves that will provide educational, social, and economic benefits.\nThis Strategy places stakeholder engagement at the center of all its efforts. CRO Valsagna and her team ensured that regular engagement with the city\u2019s different communities and sectors was fundamental to their work. The Strategy reflects this, as well as the commitment to\nembed this active participation in the future decisions the city makes. Their work presents one of the clearest examples of what can be achieved by planning through a lens of resilience and it can serve as a model to others. From its early work and active engagement with the network, Santa Fe is well positioned to help us in leading the global urban resilience revolution.\nSanta Fe has already shown its ability to recover, adapt and lead through innovative change. As the hard work now truly begins, we are excited to see it unfold and continue our partnership. Congratulations again on this enormous achievement.\nMICHAEL BERKOWITZ\nPresident, 100 Resilient Cities\n\u201cFrom its early work and active engagement with the network, Santa Fe is well positioned to help us in leading the global urban resilience revolution.\u201d\nA long term vision for the city\nWhat will Santa Fe be like in 20 or 50 years\u2019 time? What do we want it to be like? These questions sum up the long way we have come since the city joined the 100 Resilient Cities Program, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, over a year ago.\nThe challenge was to analyze current shocks and stresses from different viewpoints and with a long-term vision. We consulted different stakeholders - civil society actors, the private sector, academia, and different state level - aiming to get their input. Once again, we opened debate on basic questions, such as: What should be improved to build an inclusive, integrated, connected and thriving Santa Fe, pursuant to the goals set forth in the Action Plan developed by the City Government led by Mayor Jose Corral?\nAt present, it goes without saying that city management requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to challenges faced by different sectors. Quality of life should not only be measured in terms of access to basic services, but also in terms of connectivity and transport, infrastructure, social cohesion, open public spaces and integrated habitats, the value of human capital and citizen engagement.\nLocal governments are becoming more prominent in the international agenda, because cities and their regions face the biggest challenges of the 21st century. And local governments are the closest to the people; they are the most acquainted with local stresses, shocks and their negative consequences, and they must resort to new paradigms to address them and plan the city development.\nThe Resilience Framework has enabled us to analyze communities\u2019 capacity to address and overcome crises while dealing with chronic stresses. This approach analyzes urban development through the lens of equity, governance and sustainability, and takes into account all sides of a problem. Because low-income households are most likely to live in low-lying areas at greater risk of flooding, and endure the highest unemployment and violence rates; because infrastructure needs (services, transport, sewers) are correlated with climate change needs; because challenges transcend jurisdictional borders and call for a metropolitan approach; because sustainable means of living go hand in hand with lower vulnerability to risk.\nThe collaborative work and networking activities carried out with other cities, experts and city stakeholders have been most enriching, and encouraged us to set ambitious targets.\nSanta Fe\u2019s Resilience Strategy envisions a city that embraces change, connects to opportunity, fosters residents\u2019 engagement, and regards innovation as a knowledge-based outcome; a thriving city that looks forward, is not afraid of change and spearheads regional development; a city with a dynamic community that protects life and the environment, thus ensuring a healthier place for all of us to live in. Santa Fe has enthusiastically lived up to the challenge of dreaming big, of having a long-term vision. This document sums up the measures to be taken in order to make those dreams come true. It is not an easy task; we must join efforts, build on existing capacities and knowledge, and work together to increase the chances of success. But we know we can do it, because this document is the result of hard teamwork and the contributions made by hundreds of institutions, experts and social leaders who have done their part.\nI would like to express my gratitude to the 100RC Program for their continuous support and to Arup, our strategic partner, for helping us take our first step. Now, it is up to us -Santafesinians- to work together to build a more resilient Santa Fe.\nANDREA VALSAGNA\nChief Resilience Officer (CRO), 100 Resilient Cities\n\u201cSanta Fe has enthusiastically accepted and lived up to the challenge of dreaming big, of having a long-term vision. This document sums up the measures to be taken in order to make those dreams come true.\u201d\nExecutive\nsummary\nSanta Fe is one of the ten biggest and oldest cities in Argentina. It is the birthplace of the National Constitution and a center of scientific, cultural, commercial and service activities. It is located in a region with a growing agro-industry and bio-economy sector. Almost three-quarters of its territory is covered by rivers and swamps, which have shaped its growth throughout history.\nAfter the catastrophic floods of 2003 and 2007, the city developed a strong risk reduction policy to further develop the preparedness of its government, population, institutions and infrastructure systems to better deal with water-related emergencies. Santa Fe has learned from disaster, for which it has been awarded domestic and international recognition; but it has also discovered that there are other shocks and chronic stresses to be tackled.\nIn December 2014, Santa Fe was selected to join the 100 Resilient Cities Network (100RC), pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation; and in 2015, the city started to work on the preliminary assessment and the design of resilience-driven initiatives.\nCity violence, housing deficit, habitat degradation, obsolete infrastructure, environmental problems, social exclusion and the lack of personal, social and economic development opportunities are some of the stresses identified in the Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA), published in August 2016.\nFollowing the PRA, the city Resilience Office worked very hard for ten months, conducting studies into discovery areas and asking for advice; organizing workshops, interviews and work meetings that were attended by over 1000 people to identify potential projects.\nThe Resilience Strategy is the outcome of this highly participatory process, and is structured into four pillars, namely:\n1.\tEmbrace Change. A Santa Fe that looks into the future and works at a metropolitan scale.\n2.\tConnect to Opportunity. A Santa Fe that grows with equity and guarantees access to basic services.\n3.\tFoster Residents\u2019 Engagement. A Santa Fe that fosters a sense of belonging, social cohesion and the right to the city.\n4.\tUnderstand to innovate. A Santa Fe that manages knowledge and takes advantage of new technologies to foster local development.\nThis document is organized into five sections: The Introduction presents the City Resilience Framework. The \u201cContext and Challenges faced by Santa Fe\u201d section describes the city\u2019s strengths, weaknesses and emerging challenges through the lens of resilience. The \u201cResilience Strategy\u201d section details the city\u2019s vision, pillars and objectives, and includes a description of 50 initiatives devised as an ecosystem. Finally, the \u201cNetworking\u201d section describes the collaborative work carried out with other 100RC cities and partners; and the \u201cNext Steps\u201d section depicts the actions to be taken to implement the Strategy.\nBut this is not just a document, it is a call to action, a dynamic statement of goals and targets, initiatives and projects; a pledge made by Santa Fe\u2019s residents to build a dynamic and thriving city, a city that is not afraid of innovation and change, a city full of opportunities to grow. A city that has learned from challenges. A city that protects life and embraces living in harmony with its rivers. In short, a more resilient Santa Fe.\n100 reSilient CitieS initiatiVe\nThe city of Santa Fe, Argentina, was selected to jin 100 Resilient Cities, a program pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation to help more cities around the world build resilience to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century.\nThe 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) program fosters the creation and adoption of a resilient vision to not only be better equipped to deal with catastrophic\nevents -such as earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.- but also with stresses that weaken the fabric of a city\nINTRO-\nDUCTION\non a day-to-day or cyclical basis, such as aging infrastructure and unemployment.\nFor Santa Fe, being selected as a member of the 100RC brings recognition by the international community on the progress made by the city in the field of water-related hazards and disaster risk reduction; and additionally presents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to tackle new 21st century urban problems such as social inequity, violence, climate change and sustainable development. Within this framework, the Santa Fe Municipality organized workshops to design a Resilience Strategy, based on the program guidelines.\nThe 100RC Network supports member cities with\nlogistics and funding so that they can appoint a Chief Resilient Officer (CRO1) and hire a team of professionals to lead resilience-building activities in the city. The network also offers member\ncities technical assistance and resilience-building tools and expertise to help them develop a robust Resilience Strategy. It also facilitates cities' access to the 100RC Platform of Partners to help them plan and implement their strategy process. Finally, the 100RC network offers a global resilience\npartnership to help member cities learn from each other's experience and help one another.\nThe strategy development is a three-cycle process with the following goals:\nLIFECYCLE 1................ LIFECYCLE 2.....................\nOrientation and\tResilience Strategy Development Process\nLaunch Process\nLIFECYCLE 3\nImplementation and Monitoring Process\n>\nCRO WAS APPOINTED\nSTRATEGY\nDEVELOPMENT\nRESILIENCE\nPRELIMINARY\nSTRATEGY WAS PUBLISHED\nMEMBERSHIP WAS ANNOUNCED\nAGENDA-SETTING\tPROCESS BEGAN\nWORKSHOP TOOK PLACE\nASSESSMENT\nFirst steps toward Strategy Development.\nTo start working with the 100RC network, the Municipality of the city of Santa Fe had to sign a grant agreement with 100RC and then select and appoint a\nChief Resilience Officer. During the first phase, the 100 Resilient Cities Program Workshop was launched in Santa Fe.\nA Preliminary Resilience Assessment was carried out to analyze emerging themes, with the goal of developing a Resilience Strategy.\nSTAGE 1. We identified the main stresses and threats facing the city. Through a collaborative process of stakeholder consultation and research, we made a baseline evaluation and identified emerging cross-cutting resilience themes in Santa Fe. The Preliminary Resilience Assessment marked the conclusion of Phase 1 of the Resilience Strategy Development process.\nSTAGE 2. We analyzed emerging themes with the goal of developing a Resilience Strategy. We focused on the Preliminary Resilience Assessment themes, and organized workshops, conducted research and drafted reports to delve into the challenges and identify initiatives to tackle them. The launch of the Resilience Strategy marked the conclusion of Phase 2.\nImplementation of the Resilience Strategy.\nDifferent initiatives are implemented with the intention of building a more resilient city.\nWHAT IS RESILIENCE?\nResilience is a term that emerged from the field of ecology in the 1970s, to describe the capacity of a system to maintain or recover functionality in the event of disruption or disturbance. It is applicable to cities because they are complex systems that are constantly adapting to changing circumstances-. Thus, city resilience is defined as the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience. To maintain a consistent view of what resilience means to cities worldwide, 100RC strongly recommends a resilience framework that enables you to analyze existing information about a city, and to articulate challenges and opportunities through the lens of resilience.\nThe City Resilience Framework (CRF3) aims to articulate urban resilience in a measurable, evidence-based and accessible way that can inform urban planning, practice and investment patterns. It also describes resilience as the capacity of cities to function, adapt and change their behavior to survive and thrive shocks and stresses4.\nThe CRF comprises 4 dimensions, 12 drivers and 52 sub-drivers that help cities articulate processes associated with building resilience. When taken as a whole, they represent a city\u2019s ability to emerge stronger from a wide range of stresses and shocks. This provides a lens to understand the complexity of cities and can help them assess their capacity to recover, identify critical areas and develop initiatives and programs to improve such capacity.\nIt also provides a common language that enables cities to share knowledge and experiences.\nQUALITIES OF RESILIENT CITIES\nReflective: Using past experience to inform future decisions.\nResourceful: Recognizing alternative ways to use resources.\nRobust: Well-conceived, constructed and managed systems.\nRedundant: Spare capacity purposively created to accommodate disruption.\nFlexible: Willingness and ability to adopt alternative strategies in response to changing circunstances.\nInclusive: Prioritize broad consultation to create a sense of shared ownership in decision making.\nIntegrated: Bring together a range of distinct systems and institutions.\nreSilienCe Strategy deVelopMent proCeSS\nThe development and implementation of a\nResilience Strategy in Santa Fe represents a one-\nof-a-kind opportunity to bring about innovative\nand joint solutions, develop the preparedness of\nthe city and the community, overcome current\nstresses and deal with future challenges. To that\nend, several factors proved to be essential to ensure a comprehensive and holistic approach: firstly, the innovative methodology and guidelines provided by the 100RC program, and secondly, the broad\nconsultation process carried out by Santa Fe that\ninvolved different State levels, the private sector,\nacademia and civil society.\nThe actions developed during the strategy\nprocess were identified by gathering input\nfrom stakeholders with relevant knowledge and\nexpertise, analyzing surveys and studies on the\nPartners' Platform, interviewing technical staff\nand government officials, conducting public\nopinion polls, organizing thematic round tables and workshops, sourcing best practices from cities in the Network, and attending international summits\nsuch as Habitat III, Mercociudades and UNISDR\nRegional Platform. Therefore, this Strategy, its\ngoals and initiatives are based on the invaluable\ninsight provided by different City stakeholders.\nThis participatory process allowed us to leverage\nexisting knowledge and initiatives in the\ncommunity, identify strengths and assets, gain\naccess to new sources of information to make a\ndeeper assessment, and identify new stakeholders, potential partners and projects; and all this resulted in a sound Resilience Strategy. It also gave us the\nchance to interact with different actors and ensure a multidisciplinary approach to city resilience.\nTo this end, ordinance was passed by the city of Santa Fe to create two bodies that offer advice and guidance to the City Resilience Office, namely: the Municipal Committee of Resilience, made up of representatives from different City departments, and the Resilience Advisory Board, whose members represent the private and public sectors, as well as civil society.\nCONTEXT ND CHA-\n\nLLENGES\nContext\na hiStoriC City\nSanta Fe, the capital city of the homonymous province, is located in Argentina's east-center. Founded in 1573, it was one of the first urban settlements in the country, and played a key role throughout its history, especially in colonial times, when the port of Santa Fe was granted the right to charge taxes on all passing ships (this privilege was called Puerto Preciso), and during the consolidation period of the Argentine Republic.\nIn 1651, due to different territorial conflicts and river overflows, the city was moved to its current site, in the confluence of the floodplains of the Salado and the Saladillo Rivers. Its urban grid expanded towards the Setubal lagoon waterfront and the Coronda River, across from the islands in the Parana River. This is why its borders are mostly rivers and over 70% of its territory -which has an area of 26,800 hectares- is made up of rivers, lagoons and swamps.\nSanta Fe has a hectic political and institutional life, in keeping with its status as the capital city of the province. Due to its strategic location and port, the city has become a key social and economic actor, a melting pot where traditional and innovative cultural trends reflect on its buildings, churches, museums and heritage sites.\nThe city's identity has also been shaped by some highly significant historical events: the Argentine Constitution was first enacted here in 1853, and the city also hosted most of the Constitutional Assemblies that amended the National Constitution.\nA STRATEGIC LOCATION\nSanta Fe is part of the \u201cPampeana\u201d region - a key industrial, economic and agricultural area. Due to its strategic location in the so-called bi-oceanic corridor between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the city of Santa Fe has become an important center of trade, commerce and multimodal strategic communication with top markets.\nThe city expanded towards the outskirts, giving birth to a new urban area called Greater Santa Fe. The city is also linked to the city of Parana (in the province of Entre Rios) by means of an underwater tunnel, and its metropolitan area is one of the biggest urban networks in the country.\nSanta Fe is also renowned for its knowledge production and educational facilities, namely: 3 national universities, 14 scientific and technical institutes that work in close collaboration with the UNL University and Conicet, and a large number of higher education institutions, professional associations and top researchers.\nAs a consequence of this, Santa Fe has regular interaction with governments and companies, offers a wide array of services, incorporates scientific and technological innovations into production processes, and promotes the creation of an entrepreneurial environment and the incubation of startup companies.\nA VULNERABLE TERRITORY\nSanta Fe\u2019s geographic location has defined its features and shaped its development: it is located at the meeting point between the floodplains of the Salado and the Parana Rivers and is affected by their periodic overflows.\nAs time went by, the city grid started to grow; and people soon settled in low-lying areas at greater risk of flooding, disregarding or trying to overcome this potential threat. To this end, different measures were taken: a complex levee and flood protection system was built, low-lying areas were filled, and the natural drainage system was altered. As a result of these measures, Santa Fe has become a vulnerable territory, exposed to water-related risks such as overflows, heavy rains or both.\nThroughout its history, Santa Fe has experienced several environmental disasters that claimed many lives and caused damage to infrastructure and economic losses to businesses. The two most significant floods -the first one caused by the overflow of the Salado River, and the second one by heavy rains- took place in 2003 and 2007, respectively, and they were the costliest disasters in the history of the city. They caused severe damage to infrastructure, property and systems, and contributed to people\u2019s loss of trust in the government and the weakening of ties between institutions and the community.\nIn 2008, a new administration took office and introduced a new paradigm to tackle this problem: it adopted a new disaster risk management system that became the core policy of its development\nplan. The administration designed a contingency plan and protocol, developed an early local warning system and evacuation plans, organized emergencytraining activities and awareness-raising campaigns, and designed a work plan to improve flood protection and waste management, and increased green space and urban woodlands. City regulations were amended to limit the number of settlements in vulnerable areas, and the public services network (potable water and sewer network) was expanded to reach vulnerable neighborhoods. Because of these measures, the city has been awarded a \u201cRole Model City\u201d status, and its mayor has been appointed \u201cChampion of UNISDR\u2019s Making Cities Resilient campaign\u201d. Santa Fe has become a leader in this field, for its successful management of overflows and heavy rain in subsequent years.\nAND\n31\nHYDRO-METEOROLOGICAL EVENTS\nThe city of Santa Fe is located in a vulnerable territory, exposed to more frequent and extreme hydro-meteorological events as a consequence of climate change. The city depends on the overall condition of its flood protection and drainage systems to minimize the possibility of urban flooding caused by river overflows or heavy rains. These are complex and costly systems that need regular maintenance and surveillance to ensure their proper operation in case of an emergency.\nThe city is surrounded by 64 km of flood protection embankments, and has 53 pumping centers equipped with 152 pumps. Due to the flatness of the land, water drainage is slow, which causes direct damage to road networks, bridges and other infrastructure.\nSince 2008, the city has implemented several initiatives and is now better prepared to face natural hazards. Records show, however, that the number of environmental events has increased lately as a consequence of climate change; therefore, it is essential that current and future actions plans consider infrastructure maintenance and enhancement.\nThus, the main threats are associated with these environmental phenomena on the one hand, and on the other with the potential failure of protection infrastructure and its impact on the interdependency of systems. Threats are also associated with water-borne disease outbreaks and with the fact that the condition of this vulnerable area heightens the impact of national economic and institutional crises on this littoral region.\nPHYSICAL STRESSES\nThe city grew towards the north and the west without an orderly urban planning policy; thus, the neighborhoods in those areas did not have access to basic public services. In recent years, these neighborhoods gained access to the drinking water supply network, which now serves 96% of households. At present, the main drawbacks are associated with poor road networks and lack of access to the sanitation and natural gas systems. The situation is further aggravated by insufficient or obsolete infrastructure, lack of maintenance and difficulties in accessing funding to upgrade systems and networks.\nFurthermore, despite the progress made by the city in the field of urban waste management (due to the construction of a waste management facility and a landfill site, and the introduction of waste sorting practices), waste collection is still a serious problem. Between 2011 and 2015, an average of 374 tons of waste went to landfill on a daily basis, with an estimated lifespan of 5 to 7 years. Less than 4% of all waste is recycled and traded by cooperatives. There are 600 informal waste collectors who work in unhealthy conditions in small garbage dumps, and garbage ends up clogging the drainage system.\nSOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STRESSES\nThe basic needs of 5.5% of the households in the city of Santa Fe are not met. At the provincial level, this figure increases to 97%; and at the national level, to 12.5%. However, this figure rises to 13.8% and 10.3% in the neighborhoods located in the northwest and the coastal areas of the city, respectively, home to most low-income households5. It is very difficult for a family to have access to affordable and safe housing options in the city of Santa Fe; over 33% of the people are not home owners: 17% rent a house and 15.8% live either in a land or property which is not their own, or in a squatter or borrowed house.\nFurthermore, 1,500 houses are located in low-lying areas at greater risk of flooding or where water risk cannot be mitigated (outside the levee ring). 3,829 people live in those houses, and 47% have had to be evacuated due to river overflows.\nAs for the city\u2019s economic situation, the employment rate has improved in the last two years and the figures match those of other areas in the Pampas region. In 2017, the commercial activity rate in Greater Santa Fe amounted to 43.6 points, and although the city\u2019s unemployment rate (5.1%) is lower than the national unemployment rate (7.6%), the truth is that one out of three people of working age is unemployed or is not a job seeker. This figure is even higher in the case of women and young people. The primary sources of formal employment are business (23%), teaching\n(13%), industry (10%), personal services (10%) and construction (9%)6.\nEndemic crime and violence are critical stresses faced by the city of Santa Fe. For 15 years, the homicide rate in Santa Fe city has been higher than the national average; and in 2014, it reached its peak with 22 intentional homicide victims per 100,000 people. 75.3% of homicide victims are shot, as guns are the main weapon used to perpetrate this type of crime. Most homicide victims are men (92.2%) and young people: 48.2% of the victims were aged between 14 and 24.\neMerging ChallengeS and opportunitieS\nIn the Preliminary Resilience Assessment, some critical shocks and stresses were identified and further analyzed to gain a better understanding of the causes and interrelations and to develop projects and initiatives aimed at building city resilience. The emerging challenges were:\n-\tEndemic Violence and Crime: increasing violence, security problems, poor performance of law enforcement and criminal justice systems; high homicide rate.\n-\tHousing Deficit: precarious housing and slum settlements in low-lying areas at greater risk of flooding.\n-\tEnvironmental Management: weaknesses are associated with waste disposal and lack of recycling\nactivities on the one hand; and scavengers and their unhealthy working conditions on the other hand.\n-\tDisaster Risk Management: pending drainage works, flood protection infrastructure weaknesses, vulnerable sectors of the population are among the hardest hit (no access to basic public services, precarious housing, violence and waste collection problems), and lack of residents' commitment to live in harmony with their environment.\n-\tYoung People and Employment: concern for jobless young people and the economic perspectives of the city. There are too many education and vocational training options whereas there is little culture of hard work; and this impacts people's access to jobs.\n-\tTransportation and Mobility: poor urban mobility and few public transport options hinder the social integration of communities from certain neighborhoods.\n-\tEconomic Situation: commerce, retail trade and services are the most important economic activities in the city; however, there is undeveloped potential to achieve economy diversification, and there are underused assets and innovation opportunities.\nBased on this Assessment, Santa Fe set the following goals to better understand the aforementioned challenges, and thus identify the best resilience-driven initiatives and solutions.\nGUIDING QUESTIONS AND TARGETS\n-\tImprove understanding of stresses, like safety and urban violence, in order to strengthen community integration and create opportunities, especially for young people so that they can recover the culture of work and aim to make an honest living.\n-\tIdentify squatter settlements and analyze the obstacles inherent to resettling families who live in flood prone areas; improve neighborhood conditions and foster inclusive communities by creating job opportunities and facilitating access to decent housing.\n-\tIdentify critical assets and key infrastructure threatened by climate change; gather updated information about the condition of the infrastructure system, and adopt a metropolitan approach to the expansion of the basic services network.\n-\tRedirect resources, invest in maintenance and redraft plans taking into account climate change challenges, water risks and the increased demand on services, from a metropolitan viewpoint.\n-\tIdentify potential economic developments to turn Santa Fe into a regional role model and boost the sectors that create more quality jobs.\n-\tRegard water risk management as a transversal theme, which must be inevitably included in every city sustainable development plan.\nCONTEXT AND CHALLENGES SF RESILIENT\nTHE PROCESS IN FIGURES\nPUBLIC PERCEPTION SURVEYS (IN PERSON)\nEXPERT\nSURVEYS\nRESETTLED FAMILY INTERVIEWS\nPARTICIPATORY\nWORKSHOPS\nWORK MEETINGS WITH OFFICIALS AND EXPERTS\nCOLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER CITIES IN THE NETWORK\nRESILIENCE DISSEMINATION EVENTS\nINTERNATIONAL EVENTS ATTENDED\nSTRATEGIC PARTNERS AND PLATFORM PARTNERS CONSULTED\n#\n408\n57\n20\n3 9 8 6\n4 6\n37\nLESSONS LEARNED\nThroughout the Resilience Strategy Development process, three important lessons were learned: first, the process of analyzing challenges identified that priorities change according to the perceptions of different social actors, namely: government, city leaders and the community in general.\nHowever, every city actor and sector agrees that violence and lack of safety should be given top priority. As for the rest of the challenges, it is interesting to see how opinions differ: where as the community in general thinks that the city should focus on the creation of job opportunities and then on people\u2019s access to basic public services\nand infrastructure. All of them recognize that there is little social cohesion and little respect for coexistence rules, two key factors that should be reinforced in order to build resilience.\nSecond, through participatory workshops and focus groups, the fact that safety problems are closely related to other stresses emerged. In order to prevent crime, the State should not only improve law enforcement mechanisms and combat social exclusion, but also coordinate the performance and the services provided by different governmental agencies and meet the needs of vulnerable sectors of the population.\nThird, the inclusion of an integrated approach to security and habitat on the one hand, and to\ninfrastructure and economy on the other hand, was confirmed. The collaborative work carried out by representatives of civil society, the government and the private sector was enriching, and community building emerged as the main resilience challenge. Housing plans and control policies are not enough to tackle such a complex problem. The city must redouble efforts to improve social cohesion, which goes far beyond facilitating people\u2019s access to safe and affordable housing and services.\nLikewise, infrastructure plans should not only be regarded as a response to the increased demand on services and on service efficiency, but also as a key factor to tackle challenges such as social inclusion and economic development.\nFinally, there are two issues that appear over and over again: on the one hand, the city needs to adopt a metropolitan approach to public policy development, because emerging themes transcend in every case jurisdictional borders. On the other hand, there is a pressing need to improve data records, optimize resources and produce indicators to assess policy impact. The absence of accurate information and records within the sphere of the State makes it more difficult for the government to engage in public debate and decision making processes to solve the challenges faced by Santa Fe and the region.\nSFC RESILIENT\nRESI-\nLIENCE\nSTRATEGY\n40\nStruCture\nSanta Fe Resilience Strategy is structured around\n4 pillars, 13 goals and 50 initiatives that reflect the\ncity Vision.\nThe Vision depicts the aspirations the city and its\npeople have for the future, that is, our target, the\nkind of city we want to become - a more resilient\nSanta Fe.\nThe Pillars, which are based on the shocks and\nstresses identified in the Preliminary Resilience\nAssessment, are long-term goals that depict the\nattitude and the strategic path the city should follow to fulfill its resilience vision. These pillars enhance the cross-cutting approach Santa Fe used to develop its Resilience Strategy.\nEvery pillar has some Goals, objectives to be\nachieved that allow us to assess the progress made toward becoming a more resilient city.\nThe Initiatives are resilience-driven ideas, actions, projects, programs or plans to achieve more than one goal; they are related to the pillars and make sense of the concept of ecosystem, which will be defined later on.\nThe 50 initiatives have been grouped taking into\naccount two criteria: first, their impact on resilience building and the links among them. Thus, initiatives can be classified as follows:\n- Featured: initiatives that stand out for their\ncapacity to generate synergy, and that embody several drivers and qualities of the Resilience\nFramework. These are emblematic projects to advance the city vision.\n-\tSupporting: initiatives that complement or expand a featured initiative.\n-\tSpecific: ideas, projects, programs or actions to achieve one or more goals.\nThe second criterion has to do with the initiative scope. Thus, initiatives can be classified as follows:\n-\tStudy: document that delves into a theme or contains recommendations aimed at taking some specific action to solve a problem.\n-\tPlan: high level planning.

It is upon this premise that the city developed the concept of the Resilience Strategy as an ecosystem, where initiatives are interrelated and share some common ground and actions.\nThe next picture illustrates this interrelation among the four Strategy pillars. Each pillar has its own goals; and although initiatives are specific to each pillar, they can also help achieve the goals of other pillars. For this reason, the more holistic initiatives are placed in these areas where the pillars overlap.\nIn next pages, each pillar\u2019s description incorporates a visual that shows these links between goals and initiatives, reinforcing the above mentioned interrelations. In addition, the technical sheet for each initiative includes the goals addressed and the Resilience Framework drivers impacted.\nFinally, a leader is identified for each initiative as well as a series of partners that can collaborate in the realization of actions, by helping to articulate resources and capacities of different public agencies or private and civic institutions. Such groups are not exhaustive nor exclusive, and other public agencies, businesses and institutions could join at any time during implementation.\nSanta Fe has become increasingly vulnerable to hydro-\nmeteorological phenomena, and this has only been intensified by climate change. In recent years, the city adopted a new disaster risk management system as the core policy of its development plan, thus turning challenges into opportunities to learn. This has improved the city\u2019s preparedness for future flood emergencies and has provided the means for the city to grow in an orderly and sustainable fashion. It is in recognition of these advances that the city has been granted several international awards.\nThe city must consolidate this course of action and incorporate new approaches and tools in order to face the challenges posed by the 21st century. It must also resort to prospective thinking when it comes to developing its plans and projects. Adapting to the environment rather than trying to change it is key; and this should translate into specific action plans to reduce risk, mitigate climate change impact, protect ecosystems and significantly improve waste management.\nThese challenges call for the adoption of new city management and planning practices that take into account the trends of urban concentration and conurbation seen worldwide. Santa Fe acknowledges this process and is ready to face the challenge. The metropolitan area of Greater Santa Fe is still in gestation and represents a turning point towards adopting a resilience-driven design and development practices.\nThe construction of big infrastructure projects -such as a port, an airport, road networks, industrial parks and logistics centers, mobility systems and waste management facilities- which bear direct consequences on the economic development of the region, calls for the adoption of innovative approaches.\nPROJECT\/FEATURED\nThis is an innovative project currently underway that comprises environmental care, education, flora and fauna protection, water risk reduction and the struggle against poverty. The French Facility for Global Environment (FFEM) contributes to the financing of this project that aims at turning two of the seven rainwater reservoirs located in the West side of the city into highly attractive green public spaces. This new area, to be incorporated in the urban grid as a protected nature reserve, will feature a plant nursery and walking paths around indigenous flora and fauna. The initiative involves resettling the families who live in flood prone areas, measuring and monitoring climate change variables, launching socio-productive ventures, organizing educational and awareness-rising activities and building the \u201cFlood Memorial\u201d.\nTarget: By 2020, Santa Fe will expand the Reserve and incorporate two more reservoirs located to the southwest of the currently protected area.\nStatus: Currently underway.

PREVENTION OF WATER-BORNE DISEASES\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance.\nThe provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios have the highest incidences of leptospirosis in Argentina, and the highest numbers of reported outbreaks and deaths per year; therefore, it is a high-priority public health problem at the regional level. This is partly due to regional climate conditions and frequent floods.\nMosquito-borne viral diseases, such as Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya, are also sources of concern, because the city of Santa Fe is in the vicinity of southern Brazil and Paraguay, two hyperendemic areas.\nTo deal with these challenges, the city filed a request for funding before the Secondary Cities Project, via the United States of America Embassy in Argentina. The first stage of the project aims at implementing a cartographic and satellite surveillance system and a zoonotic information database to improve people\u2019s understanding of how to protect themselves and their pets.\nTarget: In 2020, the city will have maps to illustrate the location of waterlogged areas, host animals, vector surveillance stations (oviposition traps for Aedes aegypti) and vulnerable populations in the Vuelta del Paraguayo, Pompeya, Nueva Esperanza and Jesuitas neighborhoods.\nStatus: New.\nResults Medium term.\nLeader: Secretariat of Health of MCSF.\nPartners: School of Biochemistry and Biology (FBCB) - UNL; Climate Change and Emerging Disease Observatory, School of Medicine - UNL; School of Humanities and Science - UNL; INER Dr. Emilio Coni; U.S. Embassy in Argentina.\n04. parque del norte:\na Pilot green-Blue\ninfrastructure\nexperience\nPROJECT\/FEATURED\nThis initiative is part of Plan Norte -a priority for the municipal government of Santa Fe which aims for orderly urban growth and the development of projects (water, road, services, employment, vocational training, education, health and housing) in order to improve residents\u2019 quality of life. The Parque del Norte Project involves recovering and revitalizing 80 hectares of land formerly used as a landfill site, the municipal Botanical Garden, and several derelict green spaces. It is also a comprehensive public-space management experience that takes into account environmental and residential aspects, as well as blue and green infrastructure efforts. It provides for the construction of promenades and sports facilities, the cleaning up of lakes and storm drains, the creation of a School of Labor and the enhancement of the district center facilities.

It uses new approaches to water and land management that create even greater benefits, such as innovative flood risk reduction methods that aim to capture and keep storm water under control (unlike traditional methods that aim at keeping it behind dams) known as \"blue and green corridors\". Property owners can benefit from upcoming incentive programs, aimed at subsidizing improvements in energy-efficiency, storm water management and home elevation works.\nPLAN \/ FEATURED\nThe city of Santa Fe is a labor, education and health services center, and also has a strategic location for the logistics and transport of goods within the region. Thousands of people and vehicles travel back and forth between Santa Fe and other cities on a daily basis. Due to the demographic growth of the neighboring cities and the increased number of road vehicles, some gaps in the mobility system have clearly emerged. Greater Santa Fe needs a mobility plan that takes into account the following variables: social and economic growth of the metropolitan area and its connection to the province of Entre Rios, vehicular traffic in main highways and city access roads, the location of key infrastructure works in the islands and swamp areas, transport systems and railway network in the region. It should also discourage the use of private cars and encourage the adoption of healthier habits such as cycling and walking, as well as the incorporation of technology to ease traffic flows and reduce pollution.\nTarget: By 2019, Santa Fe will count on a comprehensive Mobility Plan for the Greater Santa Fe.\nResults Shortterm.\nLeader Undersecretariat of Mobility Planning of MCSF.

GREATER SANTA FE METROPOLITAN COORDINATING BUREAU (ECOM)\nSome of the challenges the city of Santa Fe has to face are originated beyond the city borders, for example, urban solid waste management, mobility, flood risk reduction and housing problems. In line with the city\u2019s approach to governance, these challenges are addressed from a metropolitan viewpoint so as to cooperatively manage and promote sustainable and orderly territorial development, and an efficient public service network.\nNowadays, both the national and provincial governments support the creation of metropolitan areas in the country.\nBut sometimes these new institutions cannot work properly because it is difficult to define the management model, due to the large number of different interests and government levels involved in the definition process. In September 2016, the ECOM was created pursuant to the regulations set forth in Provincial Act N\u00b0 13 532. It has already received funding from the IDB to draft the metropolitan strategic guidelines.

LARGE SOCIO-PRODUCTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS\nSanta Fe and its metropolitan area have identified a series of strategic works for development that have strong support from the different political and productive sectors, and civil society. A port, an airport, bridges and roads, industrial and technology parks, and logistics are all part of this collection of large-scale works that will have a huge impact on employment growth and economic development of the city and the region. In order to assess the feasibility of these projects, find funding sources and define the sequence of execution, Santa Fe must first systematize and record information about the condition of each project. This means working jointly with ECOM to produce a work plan that comprises a description of every project being publicly debated with the same level of analysis, including its socio-economic and environmental impact, a cost-benefit evaluation, and an analysis of its synergistic operation capacity.\nTarget: In 2 years\u2019 time, Santa Fe will have a roadmap for the development of large socio-productive infrastructure works\nStatus: New.\nResults Shortterm.\nLeader Resilience Office.\nPartners: ECOM, Secretariat of Urban Planning of MCSF, Secretariat of Public Works of MCSF; Mesa de Entidades Productivas de Santa Fe (Santa Fe Productive Organization Association); UNL, UTN and UCSF universities; Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport of the Province of Santa Fe, National Ministry of the Interior, Public Works and Housing.\nFEATURED\/SUPPORTING\n08. METROPOLITAN AIRPORT\nThe cities of Santa Fe and Parana have two small, poorly performing airports. Both city mayors, with the support of the national government, have reached consensus to build a bigger metropolitan airport for both domestic and international flights. This strategic asset for the city and the region would not only boost the economy but also logistics and tourism. The plan is to build the airport at an equidistant point from the two cities, in the Parana River island and swamp area. Although the City Building Code prevents this area from being urbanized, it allows for the construction of logistics and infrastructure projects.\nThe objective of this initiative is to promote and monitor the development of a preliminary design for the metropolitan airport, ensure that the project considers local interests, and incorporate a resilience focus in its design.\nTarget: By 2018, Santa Fe will have created a bi-provincial and multi-sectoral committee, made up of stakeholders from the Santa Fe and Parana metropolitan area and officials and technical staff from the national government.\nStatus: New.\nResults Shortterm.\nLeader: Secretariat of Public Works of MCSF.\nPartners: Secretariat of Urban Planning of MCSF; Resilience Office, ECOM; Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport of the Province of Santa Fe; Ministry of Works of the Province of Santa Fe, Ministry of Infrastructure, Planning and Services of the Province of Entre Rios; National Ministries of the Interior and Transport; Mesa de Entidades Productivas de Santa Fe (Santa Fe Productive Organization Association); UNL, UTN and UCSF universities.\nPLAN \/ SUPPORTING\n09. REGIONAL LOGISTICS\nDue to its strategic location, the city of Santa Fe is a natural logistics center for productive regions in Argentina and the Southern Cone. Agro-Industry and Bio-economy sectors are among those businesses with the highest growth potential. The national government launched the Belgrano Plan and made investments in infrastructure to reactivate the railway transport system in the center and north of the country. Both the city and the province of Santa Fe have also developed different logistics and transport projects, currently underway, such as the relocation of the port facilities to an area along the main channel of the river, or the multimodal logistics park called Inter-Puertos. This initiative aims at drafting a plan to define sector priorities, regulate the execution of the projects and analyze sources of investment and finance.\nTarget: By 2022, Santa Fe will have developed a Regional Logistics Strategic Plan, jointly designed by the public and private sectors.\nStatus: New.\nResults Medium term.\nLeader: Secretariat of Production of MCSF.\nPartners: Santa Fe Industry Association, AAuCar, ATAP, Mesa de Entidades Productivas; UTN and UNL universities, Santa Fe Port Administration Body, ECOM; Undersecretariat of Mobility Planning of MCSF; Resilience Office.\n\"Santa Fe has an invaluable productive potential and the consolidation of the city as a solid and fully-functional logistics hub is a fundamental part of its development and that of its metropolitan area\u201d.\nJavier Martin.

However, many of the urban challenges faced by Santa Fe transcend the city borders. For example, many young people who study and work in Santa Fe had to move to smaller neighboring cities -San Jose del Rincon, Arroyo Leyes and Recreo-, due to Santa Fe city\u2019s soaring real estate prices. This translates into an increased demand of housing and public services, and poses some environmental risks related to solid waste and wastewater management. Most of the towns and cities located in Santa Fe metropolitan area either do not have an urban planning code yet or are still in the process of drafting one; therefore, it is essential to work together and reach a consensus on criteria regarding the orderly use of the territory shared by different cities. Target: In 2026, local governments in Greater Santa Fe will have established a common land use code for the metropolitan area.\nStatus: New.

The current landfill site opened in 2010 and has an estimated lifespan of 5 to 7 years. The city allocates a large amount of human and monetary resources to urban solid waste (USW) collection and disposal, and garbage dump control activities. The city has launched a waste segregation plan and different composting and recycling activities, with different levels of compliance and participation according to the neighborhood. The work of informal waste collectors does not only pose a risk to the health of the 600 families that make a living out of waste picking, but also to the environment and the community at large.\nThe city wants to make a qualitative leap forward in the field of urban waste management by implementing Circular Green Economy models, not only to find a solution to social and environmental problems but also to foster a model of economic development, social inclusion and community engagement.\nTarget: In 2018, the city will have a Green and Circular Economy roadmap and, especially an integrated USW management plan.\nStatus: New.\nResults Shortterm.\nLeader: Resilience Office.\nPartners: Undersecretariat of Environment of MCSF, Secretariats of Production; Communication and Strategic Development of MCSF; Cooperation, Investment and Foreign Trade Agency of MCSF; Schools of Labor Office of MCSF; Secretariat of MCSF; UNL; Federation de Cooperativas de Trabajo Santa Fe La Cordial Limitada (Cooperatives Federation).\nPROJECT \/ SUPPORTING\n12.\tPILOT ZONE FOR A NEW USW INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT\nWaste generation and disposal have increased lately in Santa Fe and its surrounding areas. The measures taken to improve waste segregation, composting and recycling practices did not have the expected positive impact. Besides, the lack of effective mechanisms to control the waste collection system results in its poor performance.\nLandfill sites, which have an estimated lifespan of 5 to 7 years, have become old-fashioned and obsolete options. Although studies have been conducted to see if said lifespan can be extended, the city needs a wider range of options to find a definitive solution to this problem.\nSanta Fe wants to establish a pilot zone to assess the impact of measures aimed at reducing waste generation and at improving waste sorting, such as: analysis and assessment of waste segregation practices, redefinition of sorting methods, definition of \u201cbenchmarks\u201d and performance indicators, door-to-door awareness-raising campaigns, improvement and control of the waste collection service, and analysis of results. Target: In 2018, the city will count on an efficient method to reduce USW generation.\nStatus: New.\nResults Shortterm.\nLeader: Undersecretariat of the Environment of MCSF.

They segregate and classify garbage in precarious, unsafe and unhealthy conditions; they also accumulate rubbish in mini garbage dumps and set large amounts of garbage on fire. The situation gets even worse because there are child scavengers. Sometimes the garbage ends up clogging the drainage system, thus increasing the risk of flooding.\nSanta Fe has launched a program that aims at improving scavengers\u2019 work conditions and at offering them a decent and sustainable alternative to this activity. The situation of each family is assessed; and after a diagnosis is reached, a multidisciplinary work team proposes healthier work alternatives either related to the garbage or any other social economy sector. Although it has proved to be successful so far, this program needs to be consolidated and reinforced. Target: By 2022, the number of informal waste collectors in the city will be reduced by 50%, thanks to this inclusive process of opportunity generation.\nStatus: Currently underway. Results Medium term.\nLeader School of Labor Bureau of MCSF.\nPartners: Undersecretariat of Environment, Santa Fe Habitat Agency and Secretariat of Communication and Strategic Development of MCSF, UNL and Cooperativa Recicladora Santa Fe (Recycling Cooperative).\nSanta Fe aspires to become a land of opportunity, offering its residents the tools and resources they need to grow both personally and collectively in a safe, inclusive and equitable environment.\nThe city\u2019s poverty rate is similar to the national average, and inequity becomes more evident in those neighborhoods with higher rates of unemployment or unregistered employment, more problems with housing or basic public services, and greater risk of flooding. These challenges must be tackled in a comprehensive manner; and vulnerable populations, especially younger residents, should be given more opportunities to grow.\nIn order to foster equitable growth and overcome social exclusion, the city must boost those economic sectors that have a higher development potential to grow and create jobs.\nOne of the most serious stresses our city faces is access to safe and affordable housing, followed by a housing deficit and squatter settlements in low-lying areas at greater risk of flooding. Santa Fe must develop community-building projects -not only housing solutions- with an integrated approach to physical and social interventions, in order to build healthy and inclusive neighborhoods.\nFinally, it is imperative to optimize interventions of the State to be more articulated, efficient and integrated in the Santa Fe territory. Santa Fe has to adopt a new public policy management approach in order to achieve better results in terms of social inclusion and integration.\nPROJECT\/FEATURED\nAccording to the Permanent Household Survey (PHS), around 18,000 Santafesinians aged between 18 and 25 come from low social-class backgrounds in terms of average income per capita. These people are excluded from the socio-educational and socio-productive fabric, and have limited access to social safety nets. Therefore, they find it very difficult to find a job and are thus more likely to fall into the trap of illegal economic activities.\nThe Santa Fe Government has launched an ambitious program called Schools of Labor, which offers highly vulnerable young people assistance to finish school, find a job, buy their first home and have access to social safety nets. The tools offered by these schools are grouped into five categories: education; vocational training and employment mediation, self-employment and entrepreneurship; first-time home acquisition; access to culture, sports and health activities; and promotion of rights to improve coexistence.\nSo far this program has proved to be successful - it has been implemented in one neighborhood and two new communities, and the first building of its own is currently under construction. The city wants to consolidate and reinforce this experience so as to reach out and help more people.\nTarget: By 2025, Schools of Labor will have offered opportunities to half of their potential beneficiaries, and will have built two new, top-quality buildings of their own located in Jardin Botanico and La Tablada, favoring two districts that feature the largest number of young people with inclusion problems.\nStatus: Currently underway.

YOUTH POLICIES\nThe Municipality has developed various activities and programs for the youth of the city. It is necessary to move towards a comprehensive plan that orders and integrates these actions, involving young people in the design of activities as responsible actors and beneficiaries of the growth of the city in which they live.\nTherefore, this initiative proposes the creation of a Municipal Youth Plan that integrates all educational activities, cultural and athletic activities, job training and assistance, access to technology, mobility and the environment in order to improve the impact of these policies and generate opportunities for different groups of young people.\nThe Plan will provide tools for the autonomous and sustainable development of young people and assistance in building their identity, seeking to activate participation and commitment to the city, as well as to modify risk behaviours and develop a culture of peace. It will have differentiated mechanisms that recognize diverse realities and problems, as well as personalized, integral and multidisciplinary accompaniment tools. The Plan should contemplate specific actions for the inclusion of young people in situations of extreme vulnerability, with problems of addiction and \/ or in conflict with criminal law.\nTarget: By 2019, Santa Fe will have developed the Municipal Youth Plan, in collaboration with the city\u2019s youth.\nStatus: New.

On many occasions, these measures were taken within the framework of Comprehensive Urban Programs (CUP), in an attempt to adopt a comprehensive approach to habitat improvement.\nIn 2016, for the first time in 8 years, the city received funding by the national government to build 280 houses. This plan, currently underway in the Nueva Esperanza Este, Vuelta del Paraguayo and Jesuitas neighborhoods, will be the first large-scale response to this kind of problem since the projects implemented after the Salado River overflow in 2003. The IIED gathered input from the community and stakeholders, identified weaknesses and strengths of the resettlement process, and underlined the need to improve community social support services. Thus, this initiative aims to conduct a pilot plan in one of the aforementioned neighborhoods to improve social interventions through the adoption of a resilient approach. Targets:\n\u2022\tDuring 2017 and 2018, Santa Fe will devise tools to foster further engagement of families living in Vuelta del Paraguayo with the resettlement and neighborhood improvement process;\n\u2022\tIn 2020, the city will have established a social management methodology that will integrate the different state levels, to offer families social safety services and to drive community development.\nStatus: Currently underway.

There are a huge number of programs, plans and actions to deal with social stresses, which separately have proved to be insufficient and hardly ever successful in improving the situations of vulnerable communities.\nThis initiative aims to implement a pilot project to coordinate the operation of different municipal agencies and bureaus in a specific neighborhood. A neighborhood, where a CUP (Comprehensive Urban Program) and a Resettlement Program of families living in water-risk areas are currently underway, will be selected and social habitat management practices will be introduced into these projects.\nA work space and methodology will be created that facilitate coordinated intervention in the territory in order to prevent unnecessary duplication of resources and action overlapping, and to optimize the use of existing information and the assessment of policy outcomes. Participatory activities are envisaged to foster community engagement in the process.

It will offer other options too, namely: new home equity loans, loans to buy construction materials, training regarding household finances and economics, DIY construction, and new building technologies.\nTarget: In 4 years, the first social real estate office will be opened at the Citizens\u2019 Service Centre in the Northern District.\nStatus: New.\nResults: Medium term.\nLeader: Santa Fe Habitat Agency of MCSF.\nPartners: Resilience Office, Northern District Coordination Bureau of MCSF, Movimiento Los Sin Techo, NGO Los del Camino, Law Firms - School of Law and Social Sciences-UNL.\nPROGRAM \/ FEATURED\n19.\tCOMPREHENSIVE URBAN PROGRAMS (CUP)\nCUPs comprise a set of comprehensive interventions in specific city areas. Inspired by the Medellin (Colombia) experience, these programs advance infrastructure efforts (expansion of services network, housing improvement, public space revitalization), stronger institutional presence (diverse tools contributed by municipal and other agencies at different state levels), social policies aimed at neighborhood integration, opportunity creation and citizen engagement.\nIn 2012, Santa Fe successfully implemented these programs in three areas (Barranquitas, Noreste and Santa Rosa de Lima), thus increasing people\u2019s access to basic services and reducing squatter settlements. In 2016, the city extended this program to 9 more neighborhoods thanks to the National Habitat Plan, a plan with similar guidelines launched by the National Government to fund comprehensive neighborhood improvement initiatives. Target: By 2022, Santa Fe will have improved people\u2019s access to basic services networks in all the neighborhoods located in the southwest and west districts, and will implement two CUPs in the northwest and coastal districts.

To meet their requirements, specific understanding and skills must be developed, which neither the traditional State structure nor existing local intermediary institutions currently have.\nThus, the city wants to create teams to address basic social needs. These teams will be multidisciplinary and will help these communities deal with their problems and seize opportunities to find a way out of marginality. These teams will also offer prompt and effective responses and support in emergencies. This initiative should be jointly implemented with the Social Innovation Cabinet in order to optimize the use of existing resources.\nIn 4 years, Santa Fe will have three teams made up of professionals and specialists in different areas, such as medical doctors, psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers.\nStatus: New.\nResults: Medium term.\nLeader: Undersecretariat of Social Support.\nPartners: Movimiento Los SinTecho, Caritas Argentina, Red Cross- Santa Fe Branch.\nPROJECT \/ SUPPORTING\nEnhanced urban mobility, accessibility and connectivity have a positive impact on citizens\u2019 lives and result in safer and more integrated communities.

EXPANSION OF THE SANITARY SEWER NETWORK\nThe sanitary sewer network currently serves 65% of the households in Santa Fe. In line with the Storm Drainage Master Plan, the local government has launched a Sanitary Sewer Network Expansion Plan to serve 150,000 more people. These are key projects that will improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable communities and minimize sanitary risk factors, but their execution is long overdue. The plan envisions a system of shared and charitable financing.\nThe current national administration has dedicated funds to expand this service coverage.

There are 177 medical facilities, a total of 2,400 beds, and the sector employs 20,000 people. The School of Medicine opened in 2010 and offers a highly reputable program.\nThis initiative aims to strengthen the healthcare sector, not only as a social service but also as a commercial activity. Thus, actors and capacities will be reassessed, to identify geographic areas with varying levels of health coverage in the region. Some other factors will be also identified, namely: health support services, health-related needs of the people who live in the interior of the province and improvements to public and private healthcare center standards in order to establish an infrastructure project portfolio.\nTarget: In 4 years, Santa Fe will have a plan to turn the city into a healthcare hub for the littoral region.\nStatus: New.

Peri-urban vegetable and fruit farms are not just a source of employment for the community; they can also improve food security in the region and reduce the impact of climate change and water-related risks. Therefore, it is very important that Santa Fe and its metropolitan area support public policies aimed at strengthening and incentivizing agro-ecological urban agriculture, in order to achieve orderly planning, improve productive competitiveness and mitigate environmental pollution.\nTarget: In 4 years, the ECOM will have drafted guidelines to protect peri-urban farms, mainly horticulture farms, and created incentives to boost this economy sector.\nStatus: New.\nResults: Medium term.\nLeader: Secretariat of Production of MCSF.\nPartners: National Peri-urban Agriculture Program; National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), Market of Fruit and Vegetable Producers and Providers of Santa Fe, Small Farm Owners\u2019 Association of Santa Fe, Granja Agroecologica La Verdecita (Agro-ecological farm).\nINSPIRATION\nPROMOTING URBAN AGRICULTURE\nSemarang (Indonesia)\nThis initiative aims to provide the community with training on urban agriculture so that they can produce top quality organic food. The city wants to turn vacant land into urban agriculture areas and resort to available simple, user-friendly technology. It also plans to work in close collaboration with shops and markets that can distribute and sell these products.\nNot only does urban agriculture have a positive impact on the environment due to the increased number of urban green spaces, but it is also an opportunity to boost the local economy.\nP3. FOSTER CIVIC ENGAGEMENT\n82\nSanta Fe wants to strengthen the community\u2019s sense of belonging and encourage citizens to engage with their environment, which has been seriously affected by widespread practices that do not comply with city rules and show great disregard for public community assets. The rate of violence in the city is far higher than the national average; thus in order to deter illegal activities and informal behavior, coexistence principles and a culture of peace must be embraced.\nConcepts such as looking after public spaces, understanding risk, and showing respect for life, animals and the environment are key aspects of building an inclusive community. Those same concepts were mentioned repeatedly by stakeholders throughout the consultation process prior to strategy development.\nCitizen engagement and access to information are essential to healthy coexistence and the consolidation of democracy. The development of local leadership and active community participation is also necessary to co-design solutions to urban problems; in short, the goal is to advocate for people\u2019s right to the city.\nIntermediary institutions are key allies in articulating the government-community relationship. Santa Fe has significant institutional and social capacity for generating new and innovative ideas; this capacity should be strengthened through new communication channels in order to propel the growth of the city and the consolidation of its identity. To become a more resilient city, Santa Fe must once again embrace key values such as education and hard work, and must recover its capacity to engage in new projects and overcome obstacles, two typical Santafesinian features. It must also support the acquisition of knowledge and new technologies to build resilience.\nPROGRAM \/ FEATURE\n28.\tSANTA FE NEARBY PROGRAM\nThe city is a dynamic ecosystem where different actors -civil society, academia, the private sector and the government-interact and relate to each other based on their needs and interests. The City Government must further promote collaborative work and facilitate the exchange of knowledge to improve public policies.\nThis initiative aims to strengthen these interactions to capitalize on the capacities the city already has and to encourage the co-creation of solutions to different challenges. The City Hall will act as a link between the parties and carry out the following actions: first, it will create a database with updated information about knowledge and projects mastered by different sectors; then, it will analyze other experiences currently underway such as the Centre for the Transfer of Research Results - UNL university, the International Office of the UTN university, the Capital Forum for Innovation, and the Social Organizations Forum, among others; and finally, it will organize meetings to exchange and co-develop projects for the city.\nThe city will also enter into agreements with different universities to conduct research on priority themes for the Resilience Strategy. It will also build links between production of knowledge (science), production of goods (industry), entrepreneurs (ideas) and investors (funding). Target: In 2018, Santa Fe will have created a list of stakeholders, projects and potential liaisons for urban development, and will hold at least four networking events among the aforementioned sectors.\nStatus: New.

VOLUNTEER PROGRAM\nThis initiative aims to promote volunteer work among young people to foster engagement in problem solving actions, community integration and respect for coexistence rules. This program also aims to strengthen civil society organizations that have volunteers, and to link solidarity practices with resilience initiatives.\nThere is a network of humanitarian aid institutions in the city that play a very active role in emergencies and humanitarian crises. Two of the most outstanding are the Red Cross and Caritas, which are in charge of providing first aid and primary care, and organizing clothes and food collections, respectively.\nIn particular, this program aims to build on people\u2019s capacities to organize different activities, for example: in the case of young people, awareness-raising campaigns on waste sorting; in the case of professionals, financial and legal counsel for low-income families; and in the case of elderly adults, experience-sharing activities with children and adolescents from vulnerable neighborhoods.\nTarget: Between 2018 and 2020, Santa Fe will have launched volunteer-led campaigns in the three areas mentioned above.\nP3.

These are significant sectors because they create jobs or self-employment opportunities and have high prospects of success.\nThis initiative aims to strengthen existing programs and launch new ones, within the framework of the recently passed Entrepreneurship Act. Since 2012, there has been a Center for Social Economy Entrepreneurs in Santa Fe that works jointly with the UNL and the provincial government.\nIn 2016, different clusters began to consolidate, namely the beer production, ICT and design clusters.\nThrough this initiative, the city wants to strengthen existing actions and start new ones, taking advantage of a national entrepreneurship act recently passed. Thus, different social economy ventures will be surveyed, many of which are funded by the national government, to explore consolidation strategies. Strategic development plans for each sector will be jointly drafted with potential entrepreneurs, academia, the private sector and the State. Finally, training activities and events to promote this entrepreneurial spirit will be organized. Support will be granted to those interested in starting up companies, launching business plans and incubating projects.\nTarget: In 5 years, Santa Fe will have strengthened the Center for Entrepreneurs and will have more entrepreneurs and projects.

It also counts on incubators where start ups can develop and consolidate while sharing a space with other companies.\nPhoto: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/barcelonactiva\/\nINSTITUTION \/ SUPPORTING\nThe emblematic building of the so-called Mercado Progreso was built in 1925 and was derelict for many years. In 2010, the city government decided to revitalize the building, starting with its facade, and launched a program to do so. Every weekend, the market hosts different activities: a fair called \u201cDisena Santa Fe\u201d, live music shows, beer festivals and other cultural events. Artists and local entrepreneurs are truly fond of Mercado Progreso, which is regarded as an ideal place for the promotion of creative industries.\nThis initiative will launch a public-private partnership to restore the rest of the building and set up creative ventures.\nFor these creative ventures, this initiative will capitalize on the findings of the European Commission\u2019s project called \u201cStrengthening Design MSMEs in the city of Santa Fe and the Region\u201d, within the framework of the Al-Invest 5.0 Program. Some of the actions to be implemented include: searching for funding sources for the construction work, the selection of creative entrepreneurial ventures to be allotted a space in the building, and the creation of a management entity, among others.\nTarget: By 2026, Mercado Progreso will be fully restored and spaces will have been allotted to entrepreneurs.\nStatus: New.

It also has a unique architectural heritage, which constitutes a special setting for the mass media, digital media and movie-making industries. Thus, the city promotes the creation of clusters to foster the development of these industries and make the most out of existing networks and partnerships.\nThe city aims to offer targeted industries some logistics and communication services, and also build a local knowledge-and-skill sector to foster research and innovation linked to the said targeted industries. Byblos also plans to create incubators for the development of new projects in the fields of creativity and health care, two of the city\u2019s strengths.\nINSPIRATION\nCITYLABOIO PLATAFORM\nRotterdam (The Netherlands)\nAs part of its Resilience Strategy, the city of Rotterdam has enhanced the development of online platforms to find inspiration and information; such is the case of the web portal www.citylaboio.nl\/. City residents can share innovative ideas and plans for the city, and find partners and access to funding options to make their ideas come true. CityLaboio, a lab to imagine the city of tomorrow, support bottom-up community-led initiatives, build social cohesion, embed resilience thinking and support knowledge-sharing and networking.\nPROJECT\/FEATURED\n33.\tIDEA GENERATOR\nThe Resilience Strategy development process clearly showed that Santa Fe residents are bursting with great ideas to solve the challenges their city faces. However, the activities during the consultation process were organized for people to participate in person, and the number of attendees was relatively low compared to the city\u2019s population.\nThus, Santa Fe wants to create a modern virtual communication channel, in line with the technological possibilities of the 21st century, to ensure massive participation and receive more ideas to tackle current and future challenges. This marks a new way of institutionalizing citizens\u2019 participation in the public policy making process.\nTo achieve this, a project will be developed\nin close collaboration with the ICT cluster, made up of some IT and communication companies that actively work with the city government. Work with neighbors\u2019 associations and NGOs will be completed, and pilot plans to co-create projects will be implemented.\nTarget: In 2 years, Santa Fe will have established an online platform where the city government will share challenges and projects, and citizens will be able to share ideas and even partner with the city to analyze and tackle stresses.\nStatus: New.

Every year students, tutors and research centers pick subject matters to develop their final theses. On many occasions, the selected topic is hardly related to the challenges the city faces; on others, the projects remain in the academic environment and do not reach out to technical departments within State agencies. The Government of the city of Santa Fe aims to reverse this situation, and thus proposes that students from different university programs write their final thesis or project about challenges the city and its metropolitan area face and their possible solutions.\nTo this end, every year the City Hall, together with local universities, will invite applications from students to present research projects on urban resilience. Finally, a ceremony will be held to announce the winning project, present posters and grant its authors an award.\nTarget: In 2019, Santa Fe will have 20 final theses about city resilience written by students.\nStatus: New.

This initiative had a positive impact, and has been recognized by the CIPPEC (Center for the Implementation of Public Policies on Equity and Growth) as an innovative measure to increase gender equality and equity. Thus, fully convinced that \u201cformality and legality promote an environment of healthy coexistence\u201d, this initiative will launch a program that aims to regularize business activities in neighborhoods. This initiative will comprise vocational training activities, legal and financial advice, information about private construction and formal employment, and incentives to encourage small businesses\u2019 compliance with the program. In addition, advice on building codes and formal employment will be given. This initiative will capitalize on the experience of other programs in strengthening local businesses such as the Program for the Support of Street Markets, and on the measures implemented to support that sector, which is a significant source of employment for the city. Special attention will be paid to popular markets and fairs so as to organize and order their activity and generate sustainable alternatives for vendors.

Thus, the City Government, inspired by the Medellin experience, started to build a Library-Park. It is a public space devoted to education and culture, a place for gathering to reflect on our national history; a place that reaffirms the values and rights stipulated in our Constitution and strengthens our local identity.\nThe urban and architectural design of the building was selected in a public tender process and reflects the new paradigms of the 21st century, namely: environment, ecology and urban-social inclusion. The park is located in an privileged, previously derelict, natural environment by the river, and offers city residents from vulnerable neighborhoods a new public space where they can enjoy the river landscape. The Museum of the Constitution is expected to open in 2017. Different cultural and recreational activities will be organized to attract neighbors in the vicinity and city residents at large to this new place.\nFurther, the city will incentivize the creation of service ventures to assist people and students who visit the museum.

In the last few years, the municipality has implemented different programs to upgrade and enhance systems, and to improve administrative procedures and community services. It has also worked jointly with other civil society institutions to design quality-of-life and management indicators to assess public policies.\nHowever, these processes are far from being fully put to effective use. Different city departments and agencies generate, save and share information in a compartmentalized fashion, using different data-recording criteria and fragile institutional repositories, which makes it more difficult for information to be publicly used. Such is also the case with the programs for controlling and monitoring infrastructure systems, either because their components are technologically obsolete, or because they are handled by too many agencies and companies.\nThe challenge is to turn this weakness into an opportunity to generate new knowledge-management systems and incorporate new technology, sponsoring research into specific stresses and developing evidence-based projects. Efforts are being made to advance towards an open government that guarantees transparent management and collaborative work with the community.\nThe city of Santa Fe also aims to become a pioneer in the field of resilience, and use this approach to urban design and city growth in the region.\nPROJECT\/FEATURED\nSome infrastructure systems in the city of Santa Fe are supervised by the City Hall and have electronic measuring or smart metering devices, while others are supervised by private companies or state agencies. The city also has monitoring devices and protocol systems which, despite serving the purposes they have been designed for, work in an isolated fashion. By integrating these systems, different agencies and departments within the City Government sphere will be able to retrieve and co-generate data, which will enhance their performance and its impact.\nThus, this initiative will create a Monitoring and Control Center (MCC) in Santa Fe, with state-of-the-art technology and highly qualified human resources to manage the city\u2019s entire infrastructure systems. The process of opening and having a fully operative MCC will be carried out in stages.

This initiative will adopt new approaches to solve drainage problems while improving public space, by designing not only drainage pipelines but also other mechanisms or systems to retain and reuse water.\nTargets:\n\u2022\tAs of 2018, Santa Fe will incorporate green infrastructure in all of its stormwater management projects;\n\u2022\tAs of 2020, urban public spaces will be designed with integrated drainage systems, in order to increase their visibility and raise awareness of their significance to the city.\nis: New.\nMedium term.\n;r: Secretariat of Water Resources of MCSF. s: School of Architecture, Urbanism and Design,\nSchool of Engineering and School of Water Science - UNL, Secretariats ofWater Resources, Public Works and Urban Planning of MCSF.\nPROGRAM \/ FEATURED\n45.\tINFRASTRUCTURE RENOVATION IN DOWNTOWN SANTA FE\nIn downtown Santa Fe, like in many other older cities, there are government buildings, schools, banks, shops, offices and houses; the downtown is a key area in the city\u2019s social and economic life. Infrastructure systems here, and especially in the area around downtown, are obsolete and have not been regularly upgraded, so their level of performance already is or will be very low in the near future.\nThis initiative will develop a program to upgrade infrastructure in order to optimize resources and to prevent long and frequent periods of infrastructure disruption. This means surveying existing plans, updating information and studies, adopting new technologies, using new materials, installing underground wiring, modifying the public space (streets and pavement) pursuant to the Mobility Plan guidelines and making provisions for the construction of tall buildings.\nThe regulations in force will be analyzed to help create new regulations and seek funding to advance the program.\nEvery state agency and private company providing services in this area must make a contribution, including the Coordinating Body for Infrastructure Projects.\nTarget: In 4 years, Santa Fe will have started the\nis: New.\nMedium term.\n?r Secretariat of Urban Planning of MCSF.\n\u2022s: MCSF, Municipal Council, ASSA, Litoral Gas,\nEPE, telecommunications and telephony companies.\nPROGRAM \/ FEATURED\n46.\tINSTITUTIONAL EFFICIENCY PROGRAM\nBy introducing institutional efficiency criteria for the allocation of resources, the Municipality will maximize existing resources and improve city services.\nThis initiative will develop and implement an institutional efficiency program with the goal of improving information management and assessment of implemented actions outcome, taking into account the budget currently allocated per program. It will also work to improve resources, revenues and expenses management. City Hall staff and officials will undergo training in internal studies, impact assessments, and cost-benefit analysis of different programs currently underway. This program will also introduce energy efficiency criteria for municipal buildings and public spaces. Target: In 4 years, MCSF will have increased its efficiency and will have in place indicators to assess municipal resources management.\nis: New.\nMedium term.\n:r Secretariat of Economy of MCSF. s: Undersecretariats of Reform, Technology\nInnovation and Upgrade of MCSF; School of Public Administration (FCE-MCSF).\nINSTITUTION \/ SUPPORTING\n47.\tACCELERATED DESIGN LAB\nThe new urban challenges of the 21st century test the response capacity of local governments. Traditional government structures are unable to deal with these new challenges, which are very complex and lack a clear cut division between causes and effects. Nowadays, there is no single action that can solve every challenge cities face, but it is possible to coordinate actions and adopt a multidisciplinary approach to tackle more than one challenge at once. Inspired by the innovative nature of the participatory workshops organized through out the resilience strategy development process, the MCSF will replicate these spaces for the accelerated design of projects and initiatives to tackle complex challenges.\nTarget: By 2018, Santa Fe will have held 3 meetings to be attended by different secretariats, to discuss and design projects to tackle complex city challenges in an innovative fashion.\nis: New.\n:s Short term.\nLeader Resilience Office.\ns: Secretariat of Education ofMCSF, School of\nArchitecture, Design and Urbanism.\nINSTITUTION \/ SUPPORTING\n48.\tTEAM FOR ANALYSIS AND STRATEGIC PROJECTS DEVELOPMENT\nOne of the most frequent problems encountered by local governments is the lack of human resources needed to carry out strategic analysis and planning, and to turn ideas into detailed-enough projects eligible to be funded and implemented.\nThus, this initiative will create a multidisciplinary work team to identify neglected areas of research, conduct studies and develop projects and indicators to enhance government performance. This team will also conduct an economic analysis to design new financing alternatives (bonds, private public ventures) or improve existing ones (loans, taxes, etc.). Target: In 2 years, Santa Fe will have this team in place and will have allocated funds for its operation.\nis: New.\n:s Short term.\nLeader: Resilience Office.\ns: Secretariats of Strategic Development and\nCommunication, Planning and Economy.\nPROGRAM \/ SPECIFIC\nIn 2012, the city of Santa Fe launched its Municipal Early Childhood Education System. So far, it has opened 16 municipal kindergartens in the city\u2019s most vulnerable neighborhoods, which currently serve 2,000 children aged 1 to 3. This policy, which regards education as a right and has a gender-based approach, has been awarded recognition by many institutions such as CIPPEC in Argentina; and most recently by the World Organization for Early Childhood Education (OMEP) and the UNESCO\u2019s Education for Sustainable Development Prize and Skills in Action Award. To take advantage of this strength, this initiative will use municipal kindergartens as labs to promote the Resilience Framework from early childhood. It will also introduce this approach in the Girls and Boys Council, created in 2008, where children aged 8 to n can discuss and develop ideas to improve the city.\nTarget: In 2 years, the city will have incorporated resilience thematic modules in:\n\u2022\tMunicipal kindergartens curricula;\n\u2022\tResilience training activities aimed at kindergarten teachers in vulnerable neighborhoods;\n\u2022\tGirls and Boys Council meetings.\nis: New.\n:s Short term.\n;r: Secretariat of Education of MCSF.\n\u2022s: World Organization for Early Childhood\nEducation; Secretariats of Education, Culture, and Strategic Development and Communication of MCSF.\nPROJECT\/SPECIFIC\n50. SCHOOL OF RESILIENCE\nThe City Resilience Framework adopted by ioo Resilient Cities is used to identify solutions to new challenges that deal with increasing and unequal urbanization.\nThe City of Santa Fe, in its capacity as Chair of the Mercociudades Network for 2017, proposes that the network enter into a strategic agreement with 100RC to advance the School of Resilience initiative, which is a set of modules aimed at providing local governments from both networks with training.\nThe goal is to promote mutual learning and exchanges, and help governments develop and implement urban resilience development plans and strategies. Thus, training modules will be specifically designed and aimed at senior officials involved in city decision-making and strategic-planning processes so that they adopt a resilient approach to local management.\nTarget: By 2018, Santa Fe will have developed a pilot plan with four training modules.\nis: New.\n:s Short term.\n;r: Resilience Office of Santa Fe.\n's: Mercociudades, Agency of Cooperation,\nInvestment and Foreign Trade of MCSF; 100RC Network cities: Montevideo, Buenos Aires and Porto Alegre.\n^Mercociudades is the main local governments\u2019 network in Mercosur and an outstanding advocate of integration processes. At present, it brings together 303 municipalities from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, cities with over 114 million residents.\nSFC RESILIENT\nNET-\nWORKING\nnetwork\nCities\nLocal government networks play a key role in cities' learning processes by incentivizing them to adopt new and innovative\ndevelopment paradigms. Thus, the 100RC network -a program that connects CROs and resilience advocates- has given us the chance not only to learn about other experiences but also contribute to a more resilient world. This invaluable tool has provided Santa Fe with knowledge about other cities facing the same challenges, which has been a source of inspiration to launch different initiatives and to take a more active role in the dissemination of this innovative approach within the region.\n21St MerCoCiudadeS SuMMit panel on reSilienCe\nAt the 21st Mercociudades Summit, the city of Santa Fe organized a panel called \u201cResilient City Approach. The 100RC Experience\u201d to share its experience with other Latin American cities and international organizations that attended this event. The panel was made up of the Deputy CRO from Porto Alegre, Patrick Fontes; the 100RC Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Eugene Zapata; and the CRO from Santa Fe,\nAndrea Valsagna.\nOn this occasion, Santa Fe and Porto Alegre had the chance to share their progress throughout the strategy development process and, most importantly, they invited other cities from the Mercociudades network to join the \"resilient cities movement\" and think of urban development in resilience terms.\npanel on Culture oF peaCe and SoCial inCluSion\nOther important issues were tackled during the 21st Mercociudades Summit, such as social inclusion challenges and their link to safer communities with more opportunities for vulnerable groups. The cities of Medellin and Porto Alegre were invited to share their Resilience Strategy initiatives on these subjects. The panel was made up of representatives from both cities and from the consulting firm Arup, our strategy partner.\nNetwork\nPartners\nSanta Fe\u2019s Resilience Office and other municipal agencies and experts have jointly worked with our Strategy Partner Arup and some other 100RC Platform Partners to identify some specific and critical actions to be implemented across the initiatives described in this document.\nARUP\nABOUT ARUP\nArup is an independent firm of designers, planners, engineers, consultants and technical specialists offering a broad range of professional services worldwide. Besides becoming Santa Fe\u2019s Strategy Partner, it has also offered the city its services as if it were a platform partner.\nWORK DESCRIPTION\nSanta Fe asked Arup to carry out an Analysis of Integrated Management of Urban Solid Waste in Santa Fe (IMUSW); a Survey of Sources of Finance for Infrastructure, Housing and Tourism Projects; and an Assessment of the Vulnerable Families\u2019 Resettlement Process in the city of Santa Fe. For the last study, Arup worked jointly with the International Institute for Environment and Development, IIED - Latin America.\nIMUSW objectives:\n\u2022\tIdentify world trends in integrated management of urban solid waste (IMUSW).\n\u2022\tIdentify successful, unsuccessful and innovative IMUSW experiences, from which Santa Fe can learn lessons.\n\u2022\tIdentify successful and\/or innovative mechanisms to reduce waste, especially household waste.\nThe objective of the Survey of Sources of Finance for Infrastructure, Housing and Tourism Projects,\nwas to find multilateral and national funding to:\n\u2022\tResettle families who live in low-lying areas at greater risk of flooding.\n\u2022\tBuild social housing in safe, non-flood prone areas.\n\u2022\tCarry out maintenance of the services infrastructure network to ensure\/improve its performance.\n\u2022\tExpand the aforementioned network to enlarge the number of city districts with access to basic services.\nThe objective of the Assessment of the Vulnerable Families\u2019 Resettlement Process in the city of Santa Fe was to collect affected families\u2019 opinions about the resettlement process through surveys and questionnaires, in order to improve future interventions of this kind. It aims to identify if there were changes in these communities\u2019 living conditions, and to pinpoint positive aspects worth reinforcing and negative aspects that must be revised.\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nRecommendations on IMUSW:\n\u2022\tDevelop clear and relevant rules.\n\u2022\tIdentify current failures and set performance goals.\n\u2022\tIdentify institutions and human resources that can work jointly with Santa Fe in awareness-raising activities.\n\u2022\tSelect pilot zones to assess methodologies and outcomes.\nAs for Sources of Finance, a list was delivered with the names of different institutions such as: the World Bank, International Finance Corporation, Inter-American Development Bank, Latin American Development Bank and several different national and provincial Ministries.\nAs for resettlement processes:\n\u2022\tDevelop communication strategies between the different actors involved in the resettlement process, so that both resettled families and residents in general will be acquainted with every aspect of the process, including options, schedules, roles, responsibilities, and the origin of funds.\n\u2022\tDiscuss and increase the number of resettlement options, including families\u2019 voluntary withdrawal from their community and random resettlement in different city areas. This means analyzing different options such as buying used homes, swapping or bartering homes, etc.\n\u2022\tIncorporate collaborative actions in the resettlement process as soon as possible, and develop strategies to sustain them over time.\n\u2022\tDiscuss and reach consensus on different sources of finance to improve and enlarge homes; consider micro-credit systems to buy materials, since they contribute to strengthening the social fabric and increasing community responsibility.\n\u2022\tDiscuss and reach consensus on reusing recovered lands for community purposes, and on using land with environmental, recreational and productive purposes to the benefit of Santa Fe\u2019s residents and especially resettled families.\n\u2022\tCreate labor opportunities and alternative means of sustenance for resettled populations that bring environmental benefits to every citizen, for example, reservoir and green space protectors.\nRELATED TO INITIATIVES\nSIEMENS\nABOUT SIEMENS\nSiemens is a global technology company that offers different kinds of products and services. Through the 100RC network, Siemens offers in-depth knowledge in the energy, transport and building sectors to cities, for which intelligent devices and technology are key elements.\nWORK DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES\nSanta Fe asked Siemens to conduct an Assessment of Infrastructure Opportunities (AIO). This service is ideal for expanding cities with a growing population -two trends that exacerbate energy, transport and building problems- that want to improve their resilience and competitiveness through the incorporation of new infrastructure and technology.\nThis assessment basically tackled urban mobility and some of the questions were:\n\u2022\tWhat changes should be made to the current transport and road networks in the city and the metropolitan area to make them more efficient, redundant, safe and inclusive, so that Santa Fe can become a role model in technological innovation, logistics and tourism?\n\u2022\tWhat supporting projects and technological innovation should be advanced to improve the performance and appeal of the so-called large infrastructure works (bridges, port, airport, industrial and logistics park)?\n\u2022\tWhat technology should be adopted to improve people\u2019s mobility in the city and the metropolitan area?\n\u2022\tWhat steps should be taken to create a real-time information management\/monitoring center for city infrastructure systems?\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\u2022\tDevelop a mobility plan for the metropolitan area;\n\u2022\tDevelop new transport options in the city (e.g. ferries, car-sharing);\n\u2022\tAnalyze transport routes between logistics centers;\n\u2022\tDevelop an integrated mobility app for smartphones.\nRELATED TO INITIATIVES\nABOUT THE MARIO SANTO\nDOMINGO FOUNDATION\nThis is a Colombian NGO with a 55-year history of philanthropic work. It is internationally renowned for rebuilding disaster-stricken houses, and for launching an innovative model for building social housing called Comprehensive Development of Sustainable Communities (CDSC) in 2009.\nWORK DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES\nTechnical expert Juan Carlos Franco - advisor to Alejandro Santo Domingo Foundation, LRA Colombia\u2019s main partner and former Director of this prestigious foundation- visited the city of Santa Fe, and for two days offered municipal officials training on habitat and housing policies. He also organized a reflection exercise to think about how to foster city community development and tackle Santa Fe\u2019s challenges more effectively. Finally, he described concrete examples of social projects implemented by the Foundation in two Colombian cities to substantiate his recommendations.\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\u2022\tIdentify with further accuracy the quantitative and qualitative housing deficit in the city, and carry out an exploratory survey of the land to find the best zones available to develop big housing projects.\n\u2022\tIncrease efficiency in the production of social\nhousing to reduce construction costs, with the goal of finding the private or public funding necessary to build social infrastructure and\/or implement programs to support community development.\n\u2022\tCarry out a detailed and comparative assessment of social housing production costs for the city and identify production techniques and materials.\n\u2022\tAcknowledge the importance of home ownership and family patrimony to spur community development.\nRELATED TO INITIATIVES\nABOUT EY\nEY is a multinational company that provides consulting and guidance services in 4 main areas -Auditing, Consulting on Business, Tax Advice and Consulting on Finance and Acquisitions-, and its Services Center provides support in other areas such as Human Resources and IT.\nAt present EY employs over 230,000 people and has 728 offices in 150 countries.\nWORK DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES\nThe Resilience Office asked EY to first identify local economy sectors with high development potential, those that can create job opportunities for young people from vulnerable sectors; and then to suggest initiatives to boost these sectors and create jobs to incorporate vulnerable populations in the formal employment market.\nTaking into account the outcomes of the workshop called Scenarios and Opportunities, where participants prioritized some sectors and analyzed the inclusion challenges faced by young people, the city of Santa Fe selected the Tourism and Health sectors.\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nEY conducted a high level assessment, the outcomes of which show the current and expected impact these two sectors have directly on the city life. It also offered some guidelines for the future\nimplementation of strategic initiatives, aimed at boosting those sectors.\nThe previously mentioned initiatives specifically aim to turn Santa Fe and its metropolitan area into a regional tourist destination option, full of educational, athletic and nature-related activities to offer. Some other initiatives aim to boost healthcare-related activities, so that the city of Santa Fe may become a healthcare provider for the northern region of the province.\nRELATED TO INITIATIVES","ENTITIES":{"ORGANIZATION":["Mesa de Entidades Productivas de Santa Fe ( Santa Fe Productive Organization Association","Undersecretariat of Tourism of MCSF","NEW USW","School of Labor Office","Secretariat of Social Development of MCSF","District Centers Coordination Bureau","ICTs","International Cooperation","Intelligence","GEOHUB Los Angeles ( USA","Porto Alegre","Alejandro Santo Domingo Foundation","Consultative Council on Resilience","Foundation","Province of Santa Fe","ASSA","EPE","Santa Fe Industry Association","Ministry of Science","Program of Economic and Social Research and Statistics of MCSF","School of Economics","Colombian NGO","National Secretariat of Science and Technology , Ministry of Science","International Institute for Environment and Development","Latin American Development Bank","Citizens \u2019 Service Centre","Services Center","Opportunities Schools of Labor 68 Youth Policy 69 Resettlement of Families Living","National Constitution","Habitat Agency of MCSF","UNISDR Campaign Role Model City","Nueva Esperanza","Resilience Strategy Development Process","Small Farm Owners \u2019 Association of Santa Fe","Foreign Trade Agency of MCSF","Secretariat of Water Resources","Platform Partners","VULNERABLE TERRITORY Santa Fe","Strategy Development","Schools of Labor Office","USW","Social Research and Statistics of MCSF ;
